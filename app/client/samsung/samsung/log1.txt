PARIS — In another in a video series of designers in their offices, we go behind the scenes with Rick Owens, an American in Paris who lives and works in his own building.
Here, he discusses renovation, responsibility and the importance of rocks.
And that’s just the stuff that didn’t make it into the video.
(The conversation has been edited and condensed.
How long have you been in this building.
When we first moved in, it had drop acoustical tile ceilings with fluorescent lights and carpeting and wallpaper, and we ripped it all out.
We did it right before a show period, so we hadn’t had time to seal anything, like the concrete or the walls or anything, so the bottom floors were filthy and everybody, all of the buyers, knew who had been to the Rick Owens showroom in Paris because they would be walking in the streets covered head to foot in dust.
I think they were delighted a little bit because it was such an extreme experience and they probably felt like they had an adventure.
As well as some asbestos poisoning or something.
Was it weird to move from Hollywood Boulevard, where you started your career, to the Seventh Arrondissement in Paris.
You are right behind the Assemblée Nationale.
When we first moved to Paris, we lived in the Marais, and there’s just too many parties with all of those kids running around.
Here, it’s just embassies and old families.
Everybody in this building has some kind of aristocratic name, and I am this nouveau riche American that’s ruining the neighborhood.
One of my favorite things is going to sleep at night, and we can hear the footsteps on the gravel of the guards patrolling the garden.
It’s just the most delicious sense of security.
Why did you decide to come to Paris.
I was manufacturing in Italy, and going back and forth between Italy and Los Angeles just didn’t make sense, and since I’d started showing in Paris, it made sense to move everything here.
It doesn’t really make a difference.
There were times that I kind of forget I am not still in Los Angeles, because I kind of create the same triangle here: the couple of restaurants I eat at, my house and office, and the gym.
It’s just that now I walk through the Jardin des Tuileries to get to the gym, which is very different than Hollywood Boulevard.
Has the office changed a lot since you’ve been here.
This room just recently changed.
It used to be very destroyed, and the ceiling was kind of falling apart.
It was a little bombed-out looking.
It’s only very recently that I plastered it all up and made it all extra shiny white.
As I get older, I need more organization.
It’s not because of the pace of fashion or anything, because to tell you the truth, I’m so addicted I don’t think I would want it any slower.
I’m fine with the deadlines and stuff.
It gives me a silly little sense of purpose.
Did you make the chair and the desk.
When we first moved in here, we needed a lot of stuff, and that would have been a fortune.
So I just faked it with what we had in hand.
The chair is just a box with pillows.
I like reducing everything that I do to a rock and a fire and a fur in a cave.
So I’m thinking, What are the essentials.
We need a couple of benches, we need a bed.
Light switches should be great because you have to touch them every day.
So you keep most of the materials on your desk, or do you sketch.
What I do every season is order toiles of past styles that we’ve done.
Then I manipulate them here and take photos and sketch over them, or I do a line, or paste them up together, and then they send me another toile and I manipulate that, and that’s how we work here.
Right now I’m trying to figure out how to make tulle look like concrete.
Fashion is just a fresh combination of elements that we all connect with.
There’s very little other than tulle on your desk.
I just like how they seem kind of spiritual even though I’m not at all.
Kind of spiritual and prehistoric.
I like to think about the grandest scale possible.
When I see things that are a little too traditional or things that I can define too easily, it makes me react and want to do something that is more a summary of our experiences instead of just one facet.
Do you like working where you live.
I have this incredible advantage of being independent and this being kind of my personal indulgence.
I really do stay in my own world.
There have been times when we were growing where I did feel a sense of responsibility, and I started to think about what do people want, what are people responding to, what should I do next.
And I learned that that was a mistake.
I learned that listening didn’t work for me.
I couldn’t interpret well enough.
I hadn’t developed the social skills to filter what was valuable and what was distraction.
So finally I learned that I really had to be completely selfish and just think about what amused me, what I enjoy.
Because people seem to respond to the things that I connect to the most.
Dear Diary: The lights are on down there, but that dark-haired woman has suddenly moved out.
No furniture in the rooms, nothing.
She hadn’t been in the apartment long, maybe three months.
Seems so empty, so vacant, without her.
Didn’t know her name, or even what she looked like, really, the distance between our buildings too great.
Her blinds, like mine, were usually up.
Like me, she’d often forget to lower them at night.
I didn’t want to stare; if I could see her, she could see me.
But I was aware of her, knew she was there, going about her business.
She reminded me of the woman who had been in that same apartment some 40 years ago.
Also in her 30s, with long dark hair.
One night she was yelling at her boyfriend; he stood there, not apologetic, just bearing the tirade.
Her wails were so loud I (and the rest of the neighbors) could hear them: “I can’t BELIEVE you slept with another woman,” mainly, over and over.
Anyway, tonight, it just seems weirdly lonely.
Especially since they’ve left the lights on, the bare rooms glaring, reminding me each time I pass my window of some sort of loss.

Punched Out: The Death of Derek Boogaard.

Some unlikely groups marched side by side among the estimated 300,000-strong People’s Climate March, organized to put pressure on politicians gathering at this week’s United Nations Climate Summit.
Wearing purple T-shirts, a group of Sisters of Mercy — as one of them put it, “commonly known as nuns” — came to the march from all around the northeast of the country.
The women told Op-Talk they were protesting because earth and “creation” are being destroyed, polluted.
“It’s a matter of justice, and we’re about justice and compassion for anyone who is marginalized or oppressed, and the earth is among those,” said Frances Thomas, 71.
Not far, a group of wholly different “sisters” marched, wearing green.
One of the protesters was Bridget Burns, 29, the advocacy and communications director for the Women’s Environment and Development Organization, a group that helped organize the women’s contingent of the march.
“We’re here to talk about climate change being an issue of social justice,” Ms.
“Yes, it impacts everyone, but impacts people differently, depending on who has access to resources.
And that has a gendered face, a woman’s face,” she said, explaining that women are particularly affected by natural disasters from droughts to tsunamis.
The march carried many messages from many individuals and groups — as many as 1,300 — from “Moms Clean Air Force” to activists from the AIDS awareness group Act Up.
But the overarching demand was clear: Climate change is a problem, and something needs to be done.
“The first step is to just acknowledge that something is happening,” the actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt told Op-Talk.
“Big money has been able to frame the conversation such that a lot of people still think it’s debatable whether it’s been happening or not.
” What was valuable about the march, with its overwhelming and diverse turnout, Mr.
Gordon-Levitt said, is that it made the climate movement’s claims “irrefutable.
” “The voice of global concern for action on climate change is back, and this time it’s no longer an environmental issue, it’s an everybody issue,” one of the march’s organizers, Ricken Patel of Avaaz, a global activism movement, wrote in an op-ed for CNN.
“Climate change has gone beyond environmentalism, it’s now about the economy, jobs, justice, family, security.
” Marcelo Magnasco, 50, a biophysicist at the Rockefeller University in New York, marched in his white lab coat.
“I’m one of the 97 percent of scientists that believe that climate change is real, and its anthropogenic,” he told Op-Talk.
Magnasco brought his entire family to the march, including his 5-year-old daughter, Luna.
We are leaving them this mess, aren’t we.
” The younger generation is already fighting, and in large numbers.
A numerous, and loud, contingent of students representing the movement pushing colleges to divest from fossil fuels marched holding a sign saying “Our Future, Our Choice.
” “Our futures and our values are at stake” said Iliana Salazar-Dodge, 19, a sophomore at Columbia.
Salazar-Dodge is part of the Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Network, a group of activists on 400 campuses across the country.
Burns’s sentiment that climate change affects some people more than others.
“People of low socioeconomic status as well as indigenous people in tropical regions would be most affected by sea level rise,” she told Op-Talk, adding that she was concerned for her own family in Mexico, which was recently hit by one of the most severe storms in decades.
This sense of urgency was emphasized by the march’s organizers.
“There is a gap between the speed of action our survival requires and the action our governments are taking,” Mr.
“The street is how we close that gap, because politicians will move faster when people move them.
” Bill McKibben, another organizer and founder of 350.
org, writes at The New Yorker that “marches aren’t subtle; they don’t lay out detailed manifestos.
” But the night before, one such manifesto was introduced at the Climate Convergence conference that accompanied the march.
Naomi Klein, a journalist, activist and author of the books “No Logo” and “The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism,” spoke at St.
Peter’s Church in Midtown Manhattan about her new book, “This Changes Everything.
” It’s easier to imagine turning down the temperature of the sun, Ms.
Klein said, than changing the rules governing our economy.
But “these are the choices that we have before us, this is why climate change changes everything,” Ms.
Klein argues that the root cause of climate change is capitalism, emphasizing that if no profound and radical changes to the system are made, a climate catastrophe is inevitable.
“The bottom line is what matters here: Our economic system and our planetary system are now at war,” Ms.
“Only one of these sets of rules can be changed, and it’s not the laws of nature.
” Both in her book and during the talk, Ms.
Klein admitted that she, along with many others on the left, had ignored the importance of climate change for years.
While talking to an activist from a developing country, she writes, she realized not only the urgency of the problem but a potential for larger change that could eliminate the inequality plaguing our societies while at the same time alleviating climate change.
Some of her solutions include “rebuilding and reviving local economies” or “reclaiming our democracies from corrosive corporate influence,” and blocking new free trade deals.
The issue of climate change cannot be left to governments whose efforts — begun in the late 1980s — have largely been sluggish and ineffective.
Some preliminary data show that since 1990, carbon emissions rose by 61 percent, Ms.
In “This Changes Everything,” she dismisses the partnership between big green groups and corporations and calls for a mass, grass-roots movement.
“While ‘power to the people’ may seem an uninspired way to change the world’s dominating socioeconomic systems, Klein’s sharp analysis makes a compelling case that a mass awakening is part of the answer,” writes Chris Bentley in a review of the book for The Chicago Tribune.
The book has also drawn criticism.
Bentley and John Gray at The Guardian criticize Ms.
Klein for the relative lack of specific ideas for an alternative economic system to the one she demolishes in her argument.
Gray writes that her central argument is faulty.
Humans have been causing damage to the climate long before the rise of capitalism, he says.
Instead of framing it as a clash between the planet and capitalism, it would be “more accurate” to say the conflict is between “the expanding demands of humankind and a finite world.
” He adds, on a more optimistic note that the winner is clear: “The Earth is vastly older and stronger than the human animal.

Open your refrigerator: how many bottles of salad dressing are lurking in the door.
If you’re an average American shopper, you add one or two bottles to that sticky collection every couple of months.
Yet you don’t actually need a single one.
Those bottled dressings, even the expensive and all-natural versions, contain ingredients like corn syrup, cheap vegetable oil, monosodium glutamate and any number of unnecessary stabilizers and gums.
And they aren’t really more convenient than a basic vinaigrette made from real ingredients — which can also live happily and indefinitely in the refrigerator door.
There’s a notion among purists that homemade dressing must be made from scratch for every single salad.
These are the same people who scorn salad greens in plastic tubs, wash every leaf individually, and tell you to rub your olive-wood salad bowl with a garlic clove.
As Maggie Smith proclaimed in “The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,” “For those who like that sort of thing, that is the sort of thing they like.
” What I like is to shake up a pint of classic vinaigrette once a week or so, nothing more than olive oil, vinegar, shallots and mustard, and stick it in the refrigerator until I need it.
It takes about seven minutes and makes a bright, fresh green salad an immediate possibility any night of the week.
If the goal is to add a green vegetable to your dinner (and when is it not.
), this is a whole lot easier than roasting brussels sprouts or sautéing green beans, and nearly as nutritionally effective.
To the salad you can add slivered red peppers, half-moons of cucumber, toasted pine nuts, halved grape tomatoes, soft herbs like parsley or mint — or nothing at all.
This dressing has never gone “off” or rancid, or failed to be anything but fragrant and delicious.
The flavor of the oil may not be as exquisite after week two, but with all the other strong flavors in the jar, it really doesn’t matter.
The secret seems to be in the shallots, which continue to soften and sweeten in the vinegar for as long as you keep the dressing, adding a round, bright flavor for as long as you keep it around.
In the refrigerator, the olive oil will clump together, but a half-hour at room temperature (or resting next to the stove) will liquefy it again.
I wouldn’t do this with all dressings; the taste of garlic and anchovies tends to get stronger over time, and the acidic fragrance of lemon juice gets weaker.
But with robust vinegar and shallots, this dressing is itself a pantry staple that can be tweaked each time you use it.
Just before serving, pour out the amount you need, then add anchovy paste, garlic and lemon zest to make a Caesar dressing.
Or whisk in feta cheese, lemon juice and fresh oregano for a Greek salad.
Or blend in some honey to make the flavor more appealing to children.
Or thin it with crème fraîche and minced chives to make a French-accented creamy dressing.
Last, adding toasted bread or croutons, nuggets of good bacon and poached or sunny-side-up eggs can turn any of these salads into a full meal.
And unless you’re going to live on Hot Pockets, dinner doesn’t get much easier than that.
In the wake of the conflict in Gaza, three communities became flash points of violence and began contending with anti-Jewish hatred they thought was buried in the past.
Jennifer was 39 and perfectly healthy, but her grandmother had died young from breast cancer, so she decided to be tested for mutations in two genes known to increase risk for the disease.
When a genetic counselor offered additional tests for 20 other genes linked to various cancers, Jennifer said yes.
The more information, the better, she thought.
The results, she said, were “surreal.
” She did not have mutations in the breast cancer genes, but did have one linked to a high risk of stomach cancer.
In people with a family history of the disease, that mutation is considered so risky that patients who are not even sick are often advised to have their stomachs removed.
But no one knows what the finding might mean in someone like Jennifer, whose family has not had the disease.
It was a troubling result that her doctors have no idea how to interpret.
Such cases of frightening or confusing results are becoming more common because of a big recent change in genetic testing for cancer risk.
Competing companies have hugely expanded the array of tests they offer, in part because new technology has made it possible to sequence many genes for the same price as one or two.
Within the next year, at least 100,000 people in the United States are expected to undergo these tests.
The costs, about $1,500 to $4,000, are covered by some, but not all, insurers.
The new tests build on the success of earlier ones for inherited risks of breast, ovarian and colon cancer, which can give people options for prevention, like getting screened more often, taking a drug to lower breast cancer risk, or having their breasts or ovaries removed.
But some doctors worry that the newer tests for up to 30 genes may open a can of worms, because the ability to find mutations has outpaced the understanding of what they mean.
In some cases, tests find cancer-associated mutations for which there are no preventive measures, and the patient is left with a bleak prognosis.
Some genes were included “because they could be tested, not necessarily because they should be,” said Dr.
Kenneth Offit, chief of clinical genetics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
He said that the testing companies are “rushing headlong into this era,” and that “individuals are getting results we’re not fully educated to counsel them on.
” The emergence of multigene testing was accelerated by a Supreme Court ruling last year.
Before that, starting in the 1990s, almost all testing for hereditary breast cancer risk was done by Myriad Genetics, which had patents covering BRCA1 and BRCA2, two genes that significantly increase risk.
But the Supreme Court invalidated key patents on the BRCA genes.
Numerous companies like GeneDx, Ambry Genetics, Invitae and Quest Diagnostics quickly began offering BRCA tests, and many tried to get a jump on Myriad by offering multigene panels, rather than just BRCA testing.
To keep pace, Myriad introduced its own test of 25 genes linked to various types of cancer, for about the same $4,000 price as the BRCA-only test.
The company expects to do 100,000 of the new tests in the next year or so.
It has been doing 250,000 BRCA tests per year, but says it plans to stop offering BRCA-only risk tests by next summer, in favor of the panel.
Some people who have multiplex tests, like Jennifer, are worried about one disease but get blindsided by results pointing to another.
Offit said he had seen two other patients with the same test results as Jennifer in the past few months.
In many other cases, a mutation is found but there is little or no data on whether it raises the risk of getting cancer.
In some versions of the new multigene tests, more than 30 percent of patients will be told they have such mutations, which are called “variants of unknown significance.
” “Patients are not getting closure,” Dr.
“They’re walking out not knowing what to make of it.
Susan Domchek, an expert on breast cancer mutations at the University of Pennsylvania, said: “With panels, only about 10 percent of the time do we find a clear mutation in anything, and even when we do we’re not exactly sure how we should change management.
” Mary-Claire King, a professor of medicine and genome sciences at the University of Washington who helped discover the BRCA1 gene, said that laboratories should not even report variants of unknown significance to doctors and patients.
“We need to report back only what is devastating and clearly devastating,” she said.
“Patients and their physicians need to have information that they can act on and they can act on with clarity.
” She said the vast majority of such uncertain variants would turn out to be benign anyway, so there was little reason to worry people, especially when that might motivate them to have prophylactic surgery.
King conceded that most experts do not agree with her about withholding uncertain findings.
A recent study in the journal Cancer showed the pros and cons of multigene testing.
It used Myriad’s 25-gene test to examine nearly 1,800 people who were referred for BRCA testing because they had breast cancer.
9 percent had a mutation in a different gene related to breast or ovarian cancer, and 0.
3 percent had a mutation in a gene linked to other cancers.
Some of the non-BRCA findings were serious, and warranted advising patients to consider preventive surgery, the researchers said.
There was a considerable downside: Variants of unknown significance were identified in more than 41 percent of the patients.
Some patients had more than one.
Almost all were in genes that, unlike BRCA1 and BRCA2, had not been studied extensively.
Doctors have no advice for such patients, except to wait until more is known.
Experts say that over time, as more people are tested, more is learned about mutations, and the rate of uninterpretable variants should decline.
When Myriad began BRCA testing, its rate of unknown variants was 40 percent.
Various efforts are underway to interpret mutations and compile them in publicly available databases; one of the latest is an online registry to which patients can upload their own data.
Eventually, they will be able to see how many other people have the same mutation, and how many get cancer.
Called Prompt, for Prospective Registry of Multiplex Testing, it was created by Memorial Sloan Kettering, the University of Pennsylvania, the Mayo Clinic and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
Several genetic testing companies are also helping to promote it.
Jennifer said she was eager to join, mainly to make sure her mutation was better understood, in case her two young children have it.
She lives in New York, and asked that her last name be withheld to protect her family’s privacy.
In the meantime, no one is suggesting that she have her stomach removed.
But she has been advised to have an endoscopy — a procedure in which a camera-tipped tube is passed into the stomach to examine it — twice a year, probably for the rest of her life.
Her mutation may also be linked to breast cancer, so she will be consulting specialists about screening.
Tamika Matthews, 40, from the Bronx, has had breast and thyroid cancer, and has had both breasts removed.
Her genetic tests found no BRCA mutations, but did detect variants of unknown significance in four genes that may be linked to cancers, including those of the colon and breast.
She had no family history of breast cancer, but her grandmother and two great-aunts had colon cancer.
“When they called me in and gave me the results, I wanted to say, ‘Please, I don’t want to know everything.
“But it’s better to be informed.
” But what has she been informed of.
“It’s so up in the air,” she said.
“But I’m glad somebody’s working on it, at least.

If people need motivation to get up from their office chairs or couches and become less sedentary, two useful new studies could provide the impetus.
One found that sitting less can slow the aging process within cells, and the other helpfully underscores that standing up — even if you are standing still — can be good for you as well.
For most of us nowadays, sitting is our most common waking activity, with many of us sitting for eight hours or more every day.
Even people who exercise for an hour or so tend to spend most of the remaining hours of the day in a chair.
The health consequences of this sedentariness are well-documented.
Past studies have found that the more hours that people spend sitting, the more likely they are to develop diabetes, heart disease and other conditions, and potentially to die prematurely — even if they exercise regularly.
But most of these studies were associational, meaning that they found a link between sitting and illness, but could not prove whether or how sitting actually causes ill health.
So for the most groundbreaking of the new studies, which was published this month in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, scientists in Sweden decided to mount an actual experiment, in which they would alter the amount of time that people spent exercising and sitting, and track certain physiological results.
In particular, with this experiment, the scientists were interested in whether changes in sedentary time would affect people’s telomeres.
If you are unfamiliar with the componentry of your genes, telomeres are the tiny caps on the ends of DNA strands.
They shorten and fray as a cell ages, although the process is not strictly chronological.
Obesity, illness and other conditions can accelerate the shortening, causing cells to age prematurely, while some evidence suggests that healthy lifestyles may preserve telomere length, delaying cell aging.
For the new experiment, the Swedish scientists recruited a group of sedentary, overweight men and women, all aged 68, and drew blood, in order to measure the length of telomeres in the volunteers’ white blood cells.
Then half of the volunteers began an individualized, moderate exercise program, designed to improve their general health.
They also were advised to sit less.
The other volunteers were told to continue with their normal lives, although the scientists urged them to try to lose weight and be healthy, without offering any specific methods.
After six months, the volunteers all returned for a second blood draw and to complete questionnaires about their daily activities.
These showed that those in the exercise group were, not surprisingly, exercising more than they had been previously.
But they were also, for the most part, sitting substantially less than before.
And when the scientists compared telomeres, they found that the telomeres in the volunteers who were sitting the least had lengthened.
Their cells seemed to be growing physiologically younger.
Meanwhile, in the control group telomeres generally were shorter than they had been six months before.
But perhaps most interesting, there was little correlation between exercise and telomere length.
In fact, the volunteers in the exercise group who had worked out the most during the past six months tended now to have slightly less lengthening and even some shortening, compared to those who had exercised less but stood up more.
Reducing sedentary time had lengthened telomeres, the scientists concluded, while exercising had played little role.
Exactly what the volunteers did in lieu of sitting is impossible to say with precision, said Per Sjögren, a professor of public health at Uppsala University in Sweden, who led the study, because the researchers did not track their volunteers’ movement patterns with monitors.
But “it’s most likely,” he said, that “sitting time was predominantly replaced with low-intensity activities,” and in particular with time spent standing up.
Which makes the second new study of sedentary behavior particularly relevant.
Standing is not, after all, physically demanding for most people, and some scientists have questioned whether merely standing up — without also moving about and walking — is sufficiently healthy or if standing merely replaces one type of sedentariness with another.
If so, standing could be expected to increase health problems and premature death, as sitting has been shown to do.
To find out whether that situation held true, Peter Katzmarzyk, a professor of public health at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La.
, and an expert on sedentary behavior, turned to a large database of self-reported information about physical activity among Canadian adults.
He noted the amount of time that the men and women had reported standing on most days over the course of a decade or more and crosschecked that data with death records, to see whether people who stood more died younger.
The results, published in May in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, are soothing if predictable.
Katzmarzyk found no link between standing and premature death.
Rather, as he writes in the study, “mortality rates declined at higher levels of standing,” suggesting that standing is not sedentary or hazardous, a conclusion with which our telomeres would likely concur.
The Citizens Financial Group appears to be off to a promising start to its new life as a publicly traded bank.
Shares in the midsize lender were up more than 5 percent in midday trading on Wednesday after the company priced its stock below an expected price range.
, Citizens shares were trading at $22.
72 each, valuing the company at $13.
Even at that level, however, the bank’s stock has not yet reached the low end of its initial forecasted price range of $23 to $25 a share.
But the rise in the stock price still indicates interest in what is the second-biggest initial public offering in the United States so far this year, after only the enormous market debut of the Alibaba Group.
A person briefed on the matter said previously that the order book for the offering was oversubscribed at the I.
The offering tested the appetite of investors for yet another midsize lender in a year that has brought many to seek public listings.
The stock sale by Citizens was bigger than those of General Electric’s former consumer finance arm, now known as Synchrony Financial; Ally Financial, the former lending arm of General Motors; and Santander’s American auto loan arm.
Initial offerings of banks and lenders have performed somewhat poorly this year, with the stocks of both Ally and Santander Consumer down since their market debuts.
Shares in Synchrony remain above their I.
Driving Citizens’ stock sale in large part was a move by the bank’s majority owner, the Royal Bank of Scotland, which received a government bailout during the financial crisis.

It has become clichéd to call warblers the butterflies of the bird world, but it is a fair description of these tiny, colorful birds.
In breeding plumage, male warblers are decked out in fluorescent reds, brilliant yellows, greens and metallic blues.
A long look at a warbler as it flits from branch to branch may last just a few seconds, but even in that brief time, its colors astound.
Warbler migration generally peaks in New York in mid-May and finds nervous bird-watchers fretting over weather reports and rescheduling anything that might interfere with getting a glimpse of any birds that last night’s winds blew in.
We could all take a cue from this excitement; we are in the midst of an ancient wonder, the migration of breeding birds along the Atlantic Flyway.
You don’t need to call yourself a bird-watcher to enjoy the show, and though getting a good look at some of these birds can be challenging, many can be approached at a no-need-for-binoculars range.
Most warblers have lovely plumage, but the black-throated blue (Setophaga caerulescens) is something special.
With a marlin-blue back and a velvety black mask, the male (top photo) is unmistakable and, when preoccupied, very approachable.
Sometimes a casual observer can get within a yard or two as the birds forage for insects among spring’s new leaves and buds.
Black-throated blues prefer rich, mature woods with a dense understory, but during migration, they can be found in any number of habitats.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into whether the money management firm Pimco inflated the returns of an actively traded $3.
6 billion exchange traded fund that mirrors the bond giant’s flagship fund.
The Pimco Total Return Exchange-Traded Fund is run by the money manger’s founder, William H.
Gross, who has come under pressure this year as investors pull out money and as questions persist over his management style following the surprising departure of his heir apparent, Mohamed A.
The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the S.
investigation, says that regulators are looking at whether the E.
bought certain bonds at a discount but then used higher valuations in a way that gave investors misleading information about the performance of the fund.
The Journal also reports that the inquiry has been going on for months and that Mr.
Gross has been interviewed by investigators.
A spokesman for Pimco confirmed the investigation, saying in an emailed statement on Wednesday morning: “Pimco has been cooperating with the S.
in this nonpublic matter, and we take our regulatory obligations and responsibilities to our clients very seriously.
We believe our pricing procedures are entirely appropriate and in keeping with industry best practices.
” Pimco’s flagship fund, the Total Return Fund, is the world’s biggest bond fund with more than $221 billion in assets under management as of the end of August.
But poor returns have led many investors to head for the exits.
Over the last 16 months, investors have redeemed about $68.
8 billion, according to Morningstar.
The exchange-traded fund, intended to be a cheaper and easier to trade version of the giant bond fund, started in 2012.
Gross told Bloomberg News: “Small investors don’t always have access to active management with a higher yield and a higher total return.
We are hoping ‘mom and pop’ can do a little bit better than the bond market at a time of historically low yields.
is essentially a mutual fund that trades on a exchange like a stock.
like the Pimco portfolio is one where managers pick the bonds to buy and sell for the portfolio.
’s are passive portfolios that merely track the performance of an index and do not involve a manager’s involvement in selecting securities.
has generally outperformed the Total Return Fund, also managed by Mr.
31 percent return for the Total Return Fund, according to Morningstar.
Aggregate Bond Index, the main benchmark, has returned 4.
Todd Rosenbluth, director of E.
and mutual fund research at Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ, said that most people believed the mismatch between the performance of the exchange-traded fund and the Total Return Bond Fund could be attributed to the fact that the E.
The Total Return Fund has long used derivatives to buy bonds in part because it needs to make such large purchases because of its mammoth size.
Rosenbluth said the news of the S.
investigation suggested that the better performance of the E.
might be related at least in part to the way Pimco was valuing the “odd lot” bonds it was purchasing for the E.
“They are buying in such smaller scale for the E.
so they are trying to get pricing of odd lot bonds and the pricing of odd lot bonds can sometimes not be as straightforward,” he said.
“It’s a much smaller product, and it is harder to get good pricing on smaller lots.
” Pimco — the Pacific Investment Management Company — is owned by Allianz of Germany, Europe’s largest insurance company.
“Allianz has been kept regularly informed by Pimco about the S.
investigation,” a spokeswoman for Allianz in Munich said on Wednesday.

Yet another set of ominous projections about the Ebola epidemic in West Africa was released Tuesday, in a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that gave worst- and best-case estimates for Liberia and Sierra Leone based on computer modeling.
In the worst-case scenario, the two countries could have a total of 21,000 cases of Ebola by Sept.
20 if the disease keeps spreading without effective methods to contain it.
These figures take into account the fact that many cases go undetected, and estimate that there are actually 2.
In the best-case model, the epidemic in both countries would be “almost ended” by Jan.
Success would require conducting safe funerals at which no one touches the bodies, and treating 70 percent of patients in settings that reduce the risk of transmission.
The report said the proportion of patients now in such settings was about 18 percent in Liberia and 40 percent in Sierra Leone.
The caseload projections are based on data from August, but Dr.
director, said the situation appeared to have improved since then because more aid had begun to reach the region.
“My gut feeling is, the actions we’re taking now are going to make that worst-case scenario not come to pass,” Dr.
Frieden said in a telephone interview.
“But it’s important to understand that it could happen.
” Outside experts said the modeling figures were in line with estimates by others in the field.
“It’s a nice job,” said Ira Longini, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida who has also done computer modeling of the epidemic.
“It summarizes the extent of the problem and what has to happen to deal with it.
” Bryan Lewis, an epidemiologist at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute at Virginia Tech, agreed that the estimates were reasonable, perhaps even a bit low compared with those generated by other models.
He said that if some of the latest data from the World Health Organization is plugged into the C.
model, “the very large numbers of estimated cases are, unfortunately, even larger.
” The current official case count is 5,843, including 2,803 deaths, according to the W.
estimates omit Guinea, which has been hit hard, because the epidemic struck in waves that could not be modeled.
published its own revised estimates of the outbreak on Monday, predicting more than 20,000 cases by Nov.
That figure is more conservative than the one from the C.
report also noted that many cases were unreported and said that without effective help, the three most affected countries would soon be reporting thousands of cases and deaths per week.
It said its projections were similar to those from the C.
report also raised, for the first time, the possibility that the disease would not be stopped but could become endemic in West Africa, meaning that it could become a constant presence there.
President Obama’s promise last week to send 3,000 military personnel to Liberia and to build 17 hospitals there, each with 100 beds, was part of the solution, Dr.
But it was not clear when those hospitals would be ready, or who would staff them.
Frieden said the Defense Department had already delivered parts of a 25-bed unit that would soon be set up to treat health workers who become infected, a safety measure he said was important to help encourage health professionals to volunteer.
He said that more aid groups were also arriving in the region to set up treatment centers, and that a “surge” of help would “break the back of the epidemic.
Jack Chow, a professor of global health at Carnegie Mellon University and a former W.
official, said, “The surge only becomes realized when those beds are up and operating and the workers are delivering care.
” He added, “If even the medium case comes to pass, with, say, 700,000 cases by January, the epidemic will quickly overwhelm the capabilities that the U.
reported that a new center had just opened in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, with 120 beds for treatment and 30 for triage.
Patients were already lined up at the door.
acknowledged that case counts were rising faster than hospital beds could be provided.
It said that in the meantime, different types of treatment would be used, based in homes or community centers, with relatives and others being given protective gear to help prevent the disease from spreading.
The United States government is also sending 400,000 kits containing gloves and disinfectant to Liberia to help families take care of patients at home.
At least one aid group in Liberia is already shifting its focus to teaching people about home care and providing materials to help because there are not enough hospital beds for the sick.
Ken Isaacs, a vice president of the group, Samaritan’s Purse, said, “I believe inevitably this is going to move into people’s houses, and the notion of home-based care has to play a more prominent role.
Though providing home-care kits may seem like a pragmatic approach, some public health authorities said they were no substitute for beds in isolation or containment wards.
Frieden said that home care had been used to help stamp out smallpox in Africa in the 1960s.
The caregivers were often people who had survived smallpox themselves and were immune to it.
Some experts have suggested that Ebola survivors might also be employed to care for the sick.
’s smallpox eradication program, said that local people had been paid to help in the campaign.
“We recruited a lot of people to stand guard at huts with smallpox,” said Dr.
Henderson, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the University of Pittsburgh.
“The important thing was to know they got paid.
” He added: “We gave money and food to families who had smallpox so they didn’t have to go out and beg, and they didn’t have to go to the market and potentially infect people.
If you don’t have food, you’ve got to leave the house and go out.

All his adult life, Paul Ward heard his parents say they wanted their bodies given to a medical school after their deaths.
“They felt that training a new doctor would be a gift to society,” he said.
In 2011, his 93-year-old father, Ralph, suddenly took ill and entered hospice care.
Ward’s wife, Maureen Arrigo, undertook to arrange a donation.
Giving a body to science proved more difficult than expected, however.
Arrigo first called the University of Southern California.
“You had to be within either an hour’s drive or a certain number of miles,” she recalled.
The nursing home where Ralph Ward was dying was too far away.
Arrigo tried nearby Loma Linda University School of Medicine.
It required a form signed by the donor himself, not a family member, even one with power of attorney.
Her father-in-law, by that point, “was well beyond being able to sign anything,” she said.
Loma Linda advised, however, that other schools would accept donations by family members.
“It would make my mother-in-law very sad not to be able to do this last thing for him,” Ms.
“I was frantic to make it happen.
” Her third call, to Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona, Calif.
, which trains many kinds of health care professionals, brought success.
The university emailed a simple document, collected Ralph Ward’s body after he died and asked whether his widow wanted the cremains returned to her or scattered at sea.
And her son made sure that she signed her own gift document, so that the university can receive her body when she dies.
Though many of the nation’s 170 medical schools have begun to supplement their anatomy labs with digital instruction, “all still use cadavers for some aspect of their medical education,” said Richard Drake, director of anatomy at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine and a board member of the American Association of Anatomists.
“It’s still one of the best ways to learn anatomy.
” Programs that train dentists, physical therapists and nurse-practitioners use cadavers, too; so do researchers developing new surgical techniques and other experimental procedures.
But while the need continues — particularly in places with lots of medical schools and research facilities, like New York City — donating a body can take both planning and documentation.
Under the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act — its most recent version, introduced in 2006, has been adopted by 48 states — any individual can sign a “document of gift” donating his organs and tissue, or his full body, for transplantation, therapy or for research or education.
Organ donation draws far more attention, partly because we have all heard and read about transplants’ lifesaving potential, but perhaps also because federal law requires hospitals to refer families and patients to an organ procurement organization.
You’re less likely, if a relative is near death or has just died, to hear anything about donating his or her body.
“Nobody’s there making a pitch,” said Sheldon Kurtz, who teaches health law at the University of Iowa College of Law and was the principal drafter of the 2006 act.
The law says that if the donor didn’t arrange during his lifetime to donate his body, family members can do so on his behalf unless he signed a form refusing donation.
Family members can do so even without holding power of attorney.
“A spouse, children, parents or grandparents — it’s an inclusive list,” Mr.
Here’s the rub: While organs for transplantation go through a national allocation system, body donations usually must be arranged through specific schools, and they have considerable latitude to set their own policies.
“As with any gift, the recipient has to agree,” Mr.
“They tend to be a little picky.
” For example, as the Ward/Arrigo family discovered, “some schools will not consider a next-of-kin donation,” Dr.
Drake said — even though the act allows it.
“You have to register yourself.
” Many don’t want to collect bodies from distances greater than 70 to 100 miles.
His program at the Cleveland Clinic also sets a size limit: a body mass index of 40.
“A large, obese body unfortunately is not the best educational material for students learning anatomy,” Dr.
” Nor will schools or research facilities accept bodies of people with infectious diseases like hepatitis, H.
Most won’t accept an autopsied body, either.
A few states — Indiana, Florida, Maryland and Illinois among them — make things a bit simpler with state anatomical boards that distribute bodies to schools where they are needed.
But the best way to avoid make a grieving family scramble for a school willing to accept a donated body is for the donor to make arrangements ahead of time.
It’s a fairly straightforward matter, with minimal paperwork, when she does.
“Make sure your whole family knows about this,” Dr.
The family has to notify his school that the donor has died, “otherwise I might never know.
” What happens to bodies after students or researchers are finished with them.
They’re cremated, and the ashes can be returned to families or buried in a cemetery, sometimes on the school campus.
“Most medical schools have some sort of memorial service to honor those individuals,” with family members often invited, said Carol Aschenbrener, chief medical education officer for the Association of American Medical Colleges.
“The memorial circles back from the notion of the body to the notion of the person who made the decision to donate,” she said.
“It’s a way of saying thank you.
The Chelsea Hotel community mourns the passing of one of its guiding lights, the poet, painter, art critic, and Warhol Superstar Rene Ricard, who died this past Saturday, Feb.
Rene, who will always be remembered for his quick wit, sparkling intellect, and generosity, passed away at the hospital surrounded by some of his many close friends.
Rene, who had lived at the Chelsea Hotel continuously since the early 90s and sporadically before that, was 68.
Rene was probably the most famous remaining member of the (now seriously depleted) Chelsea Hotel community.
And no account of the history of the Chelsea Hotel, or of its famous creative energy, is complete without him.
In fact, in these dark times when the city, including the Chelsea Hotel, is being carved up by developers, those of us fighting against gentrification, would do well to remember Rene as the very embodiment of the New York artistic bohemia that we seek to preserve.
Rene was one of the last of a dying breed, someone for whom money was secondary, and who survived in the city by his wits and the force of his personality and his larger-than-life talent and artistic vision.
Poet, artist, actor, dancer, critic, jack-of-all-trades and all-around wild man, Rene Ricard was born in 1946 and grew up in New Bedford, Massachusetts.
He ran away to Boston at age sixteen, where he supported himself by working as an artist’s model, and by eighteen he was in New York City, becoming involved with Andy Warhol’s Factory scene.
Warhol soon cast Rene in a movie, , in which he spends most of his time with his back to the camera, washing dishes, while Edie Sedgwick sneezes and runs a malted machine to cover up the fact that she’s forgotten her lines.
Rene had a better role in 1965’s , in which he stars in the “Boys in Bed” episode, rolling around in his underwear with two other boys in a room at the Chelsea Hotel.
In his (and Edie’s) last film for Warhol, , Rene embarks on a speed-fueled diatribe, rattling off every nasty thing he can think of to say about Andy.
This is the kind of part Rene was born for, and surely it must have been his finest role, but sadly the film has been lost.
An art critic in the eighties, in 1981 Rene published “The Radiant Child,” the first major article about Jean Michel Basquiat, in.
Rene has published three books of his poetry: (1979), (1989), and (1990), and was portrayed by the actor Michael Wincott in Julian Schnabel’s 1996 film.
Rene brought out a book of his art in a limited edition in 2003.
The King of the Chelsea Eccentrics, Rene gives one the sense of a being not of this world.
He flits around the hotel, ethereal-like, on a cloud of his own creation.
Tall and gaunt with a wispy goatee, a porkpie hat atop his head, he’s a bundle of nervous energy, unable to sit still.
Rene is quite learned and knowledgeable about art and culture and many other subjects besides.
When he speaks he’s agitated, restless, wringing his hands, almost frantic sometimes—though often he positively bubbles with good humor.
His speech can best be described as a sort of off-the-cuff intellectual rant.
Though what he says is never uninteresting, and you’ll always want to hear more, he speaks quickly and is gone.
If you’re lucky enough to run into Rene on the elevator, he will sometimes share a poem, often an obscene or ribald one.
He’s often seen with a cigarette dangling from his mouth, and the mind immediately turns to thoughts of fire.
(Source: DaCapo 2007; Photo: ) The fire, of course, was in Rene’s fevered and intensely creative imagination.
Like all of us at the Chelsea Hotel, since the ouster of the Bard Family in June 2007, Rene had been engaged in the struggle to save his home and his way of life.
And though he managed, for the most part, to keep himself above the fray, the stress—construction noise, poisonous dust, denial of services, and disrespect—and the uncertainty connected with the constant threat of eviction, no doubt took their toll on him as well.
But Rene was not one to succumb to despair.
At the time of his death Rene was experiencing a rebirth in the interest of his paintings, fueled by a successful Vito Schnable –curated show of his work.
Rene’s close friend Rita Barros says, “Rene died on his own terms and surrounded by his close friends.
New York will never be the same without him.
” Whatever happens to Rene’s earthly shell, and to the shell of this old Hotel, Rene’s creative fire, and the spirit of the Chelsea Hotel that he embodied will live on.
A simple gathering with a blessing to send Rene off in peace, will be held this Thursday, February 6, 2014, from 10:30 am – 12:30 pm at Greenwich Village Funeral Home, 199 Bleecker Street, NY NY 10012.

The conversation took place two years ago, but Dr.
Daniel Matlock still recalls it quite vividly.
You tend to remember when a physician colleague essentially brands you a Nazi.
Matlock, a geriatrician who specializes in palliative care, had been called in to consult when a woman in her 70s arrived at the University of Colorado Hospital, unresponsive after a major stroke.
She’d done what we’re forever chiding people for not doing: She’d drafted a very specific advance directive and had even taken the trouble to have it notarized.
It unambiguously said: no life support, no artificial nutrition or hydration, no nursing home.
The ambulance crew had put her on a ventilator — standard procedure.
After the palliative team removed it, she was able to breathe on her own, which isn’t uncommon.
She even opened her eyes, though she couldn’t track or follow objects and remained unresponsive.
That’s when the prominent surgeon directing her care ordered intravenous fluids.
Matlock, alarmed at this direct contradiction of her preferences, tells the rest of the story in a post on the GeriPal blog, published by geriatricians and palliative care docs at the University of California, San Francisco.
After talking with the patient’s sister, who held her medical power of attorney, he called the surgeon to suggest stopping the IV.
“You would have been hung in World War II for doing what you are doing now,” the surgeon said.
Let’s pause to think about that for a moment.
Within a few days, the woman was transferred to a hospice unit, where the IV was removed and she was permitted to die.
Matlock’s anger at his colleague and his sorrow at the woman’s treatment, or mistreatment, have persisted.
“You work so hard to do what’s right for the patient,” he told me.
Administering fluids to a dying patient increases the person’s secretions and makes breathing more difficult, palliative care doctors are taught.
“Dehydration is a gentler death, with less agitation,” he said.
But quite apart from that, the woman had done everything but stencil “no IV” across her forehead.
A palliative care consultant, however, couldn’t overrule the surgical team whose patient she was.
“I went home that night feeling really bad,” Dr.
What prompted his account of this unpleasant exchange, all these months later, was a startling study recently published in The Journal of Palliative Medicine.
After surveying nearly 700 physician-members of a national hospice and palliative medicine organization, the authors report that more than half had had at least one experience in the past five years of another physician or health care professional referring to their treatments as “euthanasia,” “killing” or “murder.
” This, despite palliative practices being broadly accepted as legal and ethical, as reducing suffering while honoring patients’ autonomy.
About a quarter of the respondents had heard similar accusations from a personal friend or family member, the study found.
And 25 doctors (4 percent of the respondents) had been formally investigated on the question of whether they had hastened a patient’s death.
“It was cathartic for me” to read the study, Dr.
“It was helpful to know I wasn’t alone.
” But it’s not exactly reassuring news for the rest of us.
We’ve had frequent discussions here of end-of-life care and why the “good death” so many people want proves so elusive.
We can, with ample reason, blame physicians who don’t want to talk or think about dying.
(A favorite joke among hospice workers, who tend toward a dark sense of humor: Why are coffins nailed shut.
To keep oncologists from administering more chemotherapy.
) And physicians have often responded with their own stories of family members who won’t accept that further treatment is futile and urge another operation, another drug, another something.
But here’s another part of the dynamic, apparently: Even when the system works as it’s supposed to, and palliative care specialists arrive like the cavalry to provide comfort care, to stop fruitless and painful interventions and to support what patients want, their own colleagues may brand them murderers.
It takes strong doctors to stand up to that kind of verbal abuse, to explain that courts and ethics committees have approved care that’s intended to reduce suffering, to point out that the patient’s own wishes are paramount.
Perhaps they have to be stronger than we know.
What is being called one of the biggest corruption trials in Hong Kong’s history turned up an unexpected element when the city’s former No.
2 official said he received a secret payment of 11 million Hong Kong dollars, or $1.
42 million, from Beijing, the local news media reported.
Rafael Hui Si-yan, Hong Kong’s former chief secretary, testified Tuesday that he received the money in late 2007 from a friend who said it was from “someone from Beijing” but refused to identify the donor, according to The South China Morning Post.
The disclosure raises the issue of relations between Hong Kong and Chinese leaders in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 but has retained some autonomy, at a time when democracy advocates in Hong Kong are increasingly critical of Beijing’s political influence.
Though I never lived at the Chelsea Hotel myself, I used to babysit for a young couple who lived there back in the early nineties.
The man was an engineer and the woman owned a small business and I’m not sure why they chose the Chelsea.
Perhaps because they liked to enjoy a hedonistic lifestyle (they had an active social life) or maybe they wanted to be thought of as artistic or daring.
Or maybe just because it was cheap.
That’s the only thing I can think of.
I was a teenager at the time, and since they were gone all the time I babysat for them nearly every day one summer, and they went out a lot at night too.
Their little boy was six or seven years old.
They were very protective of the child, and tried to keep him away from the dubious characters that roamed the halls of the Chelsea, and they were always complaining to Stanley about somebody doing something immoral.
In fact, that’s probably why they hired me, because I came from outside the hotel.
Now, what I’m going to say is the God’s honest truth, though the couple won’t admit it and they called me a liar to my face, but one night they had gone out to a cocktail party and they came home really late with another couple and they were all talking and joking around out in the stairwell.
I wanted to leave and I was waiting to get paid.
The cocktail party was in the hotel I think, or at least there was some sort of party on one of the lower floors.
All I know is it was really loud.
The boy, for obvious reasons I don’t want to say his name, came out in his pajamas.
When we noticed him we all said, what are you doing out here, go back to bed, but he wouldn’t.
Instead he went to the railing of the stairs and looked up at the skylight.
He just kept looking up and finally he said, “Mommy, who is that man up there.
”His parents just laughed and said, “Oh, what are you talking about.
”But instead of dropping it, the boy became increasingly excited, pointing and screaming: “Mommy, why is that man up there.
”“There’s nobody up there honey,” his mother said.
”“There’s nobody up there,” his father said sternly.
He kept staring at the skylight, but he was quiet.
I probably should have taken him to bed, but it was late and I really wanted to get paid and go home.
“He’s just tired,” the parents said to their friends, who said their goodbyes and got on the elevator and went down.
But while we were distracted watching them leave the boy had somehow managed to climb up on the railing and stand there, I don’t know how he did it, balanced on the top rail.
” the mother said, and the father grabbed him back down from there before he could jump or fall.
The boy started shaking and shivering all over as they both held him, almost having an epileptic fit, and he peed in his pants.
The parents were drunk and had been smoking pot I think, but that really sobered them up quick.
I didn’t even get my money that night but I guess after that I forgot about it and really just wanted to get the hell out of there as fast as possible.
Like I said, they say I’m a liar about this.
But what they can’t deny is that their son changed after this incident.
I can’t prove anything but I personally think he was possessed by some kind of spirit that night.
He was a really sweet kid before but after that he was either like a zombie or else he would go into a violent rage.
They told me to keep sharp objects locked up and not to let him out of my sight and not to go anywhere.
They were keeping him locked in his room at night because he would try to sneak out and one time he turned on all the burners on the gas stove and almost killed them all.
When you took him out him out you had to hold onto him because he would go for the railing, not rushing for it but like pulled to it in a trance.
A couple of times he got away from me and tried to climb up onto the railing, whether to jump or what I don’t know, but I was able to pull him back down and get him into the elevator thank God.
I don’t know if he was trying to get to the man or to throw himself over but it was clear that if he kept doing it he would fall eventually.
Darkness was bad, but an overcast day was the worst.
He tore his room all up when he went into his violent rages and he graffitied all over the walls in crayons in gibberish or an unknown language.
After a few days of this I wanted to quit but the parents begged me to stay and said they couldn’t get anyone else.
These days they would probably say the child had ADD, and they got a doctor and medicated the child and it kept him quiet but he still couldn’t be left alone or he would go out into the hallway and head for the railing.
I lasted about two weeks, it was not worth the money even though they agreed to pay me double.
Now I’ve done some research on this issue since then and this type of possession is never straightforward.
(Though I was a babysitter then I went on to get a college education and studied psychology and parapsychology.
)The boy was smart and he knew what was happening to him in a way though understandably he would often become confused and I think this was the source of his violent rages.
Sometimes he thought that adults were trying to lead him to the railing or even to throw him over.
He would scream and run away and hide in his room.
I guess in these instances he was not possessed and maybe he even thought the adults were the Gray Man.
When he was like this then you couldn’t get him out the door for anything.
I mention this because of what happened next.
I was trying to take him out to the dentist one day.
His parents were stupid for making me do this but they insisted because they wanted to pretend that nothing was wrong.
I knew better by this time and I kept a tight grip on the boy and kept my body between him and the railing as I steered him toward the elevator.
This time though he didn’t go into a trance like usual and try to make it to the railing.
Instead as soon as we got near the railing he started screaming hysterically and struggling against me.
I held on and told him to shut up as I pushed the elevator button.
But he bit my hand and got free and ran back to the room and started struggling to open the door, turning the handle and pulling andpushing against it.
Of course it was locked but he started screaming at me and cursing me, calling me a fucking bitch and every other name in the book, telling me to open the door and let him in or he’d kill me.
Alright that’s it, we’re not going anywhere I thought, and I got the key out of my pocket and opened the door.
He burst in and before I could get in he grabbed the door and slammed it on me.
I got my body in the way and stuck my foot in the door so he couldn’t close it all the way but he was freakishly strong and I couldn’t push it open.
He got the chain on somehow and he ran back into the apartment.
I couldn’t just leave him in there because who knows what he was going to do so I tried to stick my hand in and get the chain off.
When he saw that he ran at the door but I had my foot init and though it hurt like hell he couldn’t close the door.
Where he got the scissors I’ll never know, but the next thing I know he stabs me in the hand.
I screamed and pulled my hand out and my foot too, and he slammed the door and threw the dead bolt.
So then I was standing there bleeding and I didn’t know what to do.
I was bleeding profusely and I couldn’t even leave to go to the hospital because what if the kid got out and killed himself.
I tried calling for him in my confusion, begging him to open the door but of course that did no good.
Finally I banged on all the neighbors doors and finally somebody opened up and gave me a rag to wrap my hand in.
I told the lady to call the mother at work and she came home and tried to act like it was no big deal and I was the one who was crazy and caused the problem in the first place.
I don’t think anybody believed her, but still.
I was the one who was trying to help.
I had to get five stitches in my hand at the hospital.
There was no way I was going back after that, and I told them they should get the child institutionalized.
They didn’t appreciate that one bit but there wasn’t much they could say after the kid had just stabbed me.
The man paid me, overpaid me by several times, trying to pay me off I guess, to buy my silence and it’s true I didn’t say anything to anybody for nearly a year after that and by that time they had already left the Chelsea.
The reason I didn’t say anything was not the money but because they made me feel like I was crazy for even mentioning it.
I was just seventeen, remember.
They got another babysitter, a girl in her twenties who I knew from school, and the kid drove her crazy.
She started taking drugs, maybe she had been taking them before, and eventually she had to get psychiatric help.
I think she may have even spent some time in a mental hospital.
The couple tried to blame her for their child’s condition, saying she was a junkie, but she had nothing to do with it since like I said the child was like that before.
I feel more sorry for her than for anybody to tell you the truth.
He was supposed to start school in the fall, but they held him back and I doubt he was ever normal again.
Since then I’ve often thought of the Gray Man, wondered who he was, perhaps the ghost of someone who committed suicide by throwing himself down the stairwell.
Or maybe a more elemental spirit, a sort of evil pied piper of children.
When I asked the boy one time who the Gray Man was, he said he was smoke.
I don’t know whether this makes any sense or not, but this was when the boy was in a good, or rational state of mind.
The parents and their child disappeared into middle America and obscurity, trying to put as much distance between themselves and the Chelsea as possible.
The boy would be in his early twenties now which is typically when a dormant mental illness manifests.
I assume they’ve had him on medication all this time, but now that he’s an adult what if he decides to stop taking it as often happens.
There was a powerful attraction working on him, that I know, pulling him toward that railing and that skylight.
And so I have to ask, is this paranormal force still drawing him to the Chelsea.
Will he return to the scene of his childhood and his lost innocence.
And what form will his madness take in adulthood.
Wow, this place is even scarier than I thought.
Junkies and schizophrenics are one thing, but elemental spirits are more than I can handle.
Almost makes me want to live in the suburbs.
And this woman seems pretty authoritative too; after all, she’s studied parapsychology.
Keep your doors locked tonight.
11, 2001, my teenage brother Mike, fresh from Air Force training, pressed something small into my palm: two pin-backings stubbed on a curled shape in dusky silver.
“If you keep them safe, I’ll always be safe,” he said.
My brothers and I had always tried to protect each other.
Chris, the younger, was calm, but Mike was rambunctious.
When I was 4 and they were toddlers, I would sneak into their room past midnight to ensure they still occupied their dual cribs.
I would poke a finger through the crib slats, slide up their eyelids, and check their breathing as they slept.
Safe in their company, I would curl up on the floor for a minute, then pad back to my pink-swathed bed.
But by elementary school, our parents had divorced, and anger ran through our thin walls.
When I was 14, our stepfather and Mike, 12, got in a fight over pajamas.
Too cowardly to burst in, I stayed in bed and turned up my Walkman.
Mike sobbed himself to sleep with a nosebleed that soaked his mattress.
He had misbehaved, but my crime felt worse — I had let him thrash alone.
As the years passed, conflicts with our stepfather prompted police cruiser lights on our street.
When I finished high school, Mike’s card to me read, “…Stay another year.
” I should have ensured my brothers grew up strong.
At 18, I paid for college with a Marine Corps R.
scholarship; the military’s rules seemed enlightened next to the ones back home.
Mike later barreled into the same Boston unit as an Air Force cadet.
He tagged along on field exercises with us upperclassmen, easily completing grueling hikes and rappelling down university buildings.
My senior year, the Twin Towers fell, and I knew at some point I would deploy.
The following June, Mike and Chris pinned gold lieutenant bars on my shoulders.
Two years later, on an Iraqi base, I nervously strapped myself into an androgynous Kevlar jacket.
Tromping around our gravel-strewn compound, I doled out candy and phone cards while waiting for mortars to fall.
We plodded through our days, trusting in grace that wherever we stepped was safe.
Late at night, when the desert heat lifted, I taught my Marines martial arts.
As we punched foam mats and dragged each other through the sand, I wondered how my fist would feel against my stepfather’s face, how much pressure my forearm required to choke his carotid artery.
But I could not predict the techniques my sparring partners threw; I could only try to counter them.
And my rage did not help me lead.

The night after we ran into you in the hall, Joan came running in after using the computer downstairs with tears in her eyes.
I'd never seen her look so frightened.
She said there was a silhouette of a man in the reflection of the door as she waited for the elevator.
She looked away and when she looked back it was still there.
Then in the morning we got a silent phone call.
But that could of been anything or anyone.

The renowned decorator Stephen Sills has remained in the same very small apartment that burnished his reputation more than two decades ago, when he was just starting out.
Its recent renovation reveals he has spent that time perfecting his craft.
I remember the first time I laid eyes on it in an interior design magazine in 1991.
The Proustian velvet ottoman, the twin globes atop painted neoclassical cabinets (paired together on one side of the fireplace, not flanking it); the startlingly oversize Louis XV chenets, the cornice with exaggerated Grecian flutes.
It was a game-changer — the apartment that launched a career and inspired the careers of countless others.
“I remember seeing Sills’s apartment when I was still at home in Atlanta,” the decorator Miles Redd recalls.
“I tore it out and held onto it for years.

It has taken physicians a very long time to accept the need to level with patients and their families when they have terminal illnesses and death is near — and we know that many times those kinds of honest, exploratory conversations still don’t take place.
Smith, a palliative care specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, who also practices at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and two co-authors are urging another change, one they acknowledge would “radically alter” the way health care professionals communicate with their very old patients.
In a recent article in The New England Journal of Medicine, they suggested offering to discuss “overall prognosis,” doctorspeak for probable life expectancy and the likelihood of death, with patients who don’t have terminal illnesses.
The researchers favor broaching the subject with anyone who has a life expectancy of less than 10 years or has reached age 85.
“Advanced age itself is the greatest predictor of poor prognosis,” Dr.
By age 85, the article points out, the average remaining life expectancy for Americans is six years.
An 85-year-old has a 75 percent chance of living another three years, but only a one in four chance of surviving for 10.
Which category a particular old person falls into has much to do with the medical problems he or she has, or doesn’t have, and with his or her ability to function.
When the odds are that they have only a few remaining years, should doctors discuss that with them.
Bernard Lo — a geriatrician and an internist, respectively — vote yes.
“This is about empowering patients to make informed choices and encouraging individual decision-making,” he said.
Sadly, it takes guts to propose this when mention of the D word to patients still raises alarms.
The Obama administration had to cancel plans for Medicare to reimburse doctors when they discuss end-of-life care with their patients.
Smith, understanding how much time remains could help his older patients make the most of those years and help them ward off interventions, tests and treatments whose benefits, if any, are years away but whose harms could be immediate.
A “substantial minority” of older patients won’t want to have this discussion, Dr.
“It’s important to offer the information, not force it on people,” he said.
But in his experience, it’s the protective family caregivers who object to talking about prognosis, more than their older relatives.
“A lot of very elderly patients realize they’re in their final years,” he said.
“This doesn’t come as a surprise to them.
My friends in their 90s are already thinking about it.
” He cited a study he and colleagues published in The Journal of General Internal Medicine, based on interviews with 60 older people with disabilities, their average age 78 — an admittedly small but ethnically diverse sample.
About two-thirds told researchers they’d want their doctors to tell them if they had less than five years to live.
(Readers here had even stronger opinions: see this post about public access to longevity indexes.
) And when they do think about it, Dr.
Smith continued, “they want to get their finances in order, plan for long-term care, spend time with children and friends.
” They may be able to take fewer medications and undergo fewer procedures, with the emphasis on quality of life, or otherwise shift priorities.
“This is a challenge to people,” Dr.
“I’ve had reactions from ‘This is terrific; I’ve been arguing for this for years,’ to a mentor at U.
who said, ‘This is ridiculous; my patients don’t want to hear this, and there is no way to predict life expectancy anyway.
’” But while it’s true that no one can foretell a particular individual’s death with any certainty — and health care workers should be clear about those limitations, Dr.
Smith emphasized — a number of geriatric calculators do provide reasonably good projections, based on several health factors, age, cognitive status and functional abilities and sometimes laboratory test results.
colleague Sei Lee, for example, can correctly predict mortality within four years about 75 percent of the time.
Smith if professionals and patients have strong reactions, pro and con.
“The point of the article is to get a national conversation started about this,” he said.

Like Jean-Jacques Rousseau set to a hip-hop beat, Craig Grant offers his confessions in “A Sucker Emcee,” produced by the Labyrinth Theater Company.
(Rich Medina) bops between two turntables, scratching and spinning, Mr.
Grant tells the story of his life in rhymed couplets.
Grant, also known as muMs, has a blocky face with a mobile mouth and gleaming teeth.
He speaks in a gentle growl with just a trace of a native Bronx drawl, though he can send his voice swooping up and down the social register.
Dressed in Nikes and a T-shirt proclaiming “The Truth,” he spends most of the show near the front of the bare stage, lips pressed close to a microphone.
Though he’ll occasionally speak as his mother, his father, a friend or a teacher, he spends most of the piece as simply himself, narrating youthful screw-ups with fondness and exasperation.
In some ways his story is standard bullet-point autobiography.
He begins with his volatile Bronx childhood, darts through some dissolute college years, chronicles his subsequent ups and down as a rapper and actor (best known for his role in the HBO prison drama “Oz”) and finally returns, with hard-won maturity and grace, to the borough of his birth.
But what adds urgency and fierce pleasure to the monologue, directed by Jenny Koons, is his debt to music.
“Before hip-hop, I couldn’t speak,” Mr.
The music gave him a voice, a place, a future, helping him to “turn all that hate into a dance and a chant.
Medina provides backing beats to Mr.
Grant’s chants and sometimes helps him pay more direct homage to the heroes of his youth — KRS-One, Rakim, the Sugarhill Gang.
Even when the show threatens to turn into some sort of lecture demonstration, it’s still pretty good fun, with Mr.
Medina illustrating each style and technique while Mr.
Grant narrates and occasionally threatens some B-boy moves.
Even when the story ends with Mr.
Grant’s returning to the Bronx and caring compassionately for his aging mother, the beat and the applause don’t stop.
Excitement definitely in the air in downtown Brooklyn as we approach the holiday weekend.
As the weekend before the big week unfolds, with, of course, the virtually back-to-back holiday celebration of the birthday of Dr.
and the inauguration of the 44th Preident of the United States, Barack Hussein Obama, there is palpable excitement and energy in the winter air.
The opening of Notorious, which despite the cold, has lines outside the Regal Cinema on Court Street, just adds to the energy and excitement.

Our older daughter, now still studying in Europe, is pining for the fjords that she has to miss the premier of the film.
As one of her teacher's said years ago, when another kid was trying to "explain" to our daughter some hip hop reference, "You don't have to explain that to her, Danielle grew up in the 'hood.
The late Christopher Wallace had brains, talent, and charisma to spare.
Before he broke through, he survived the streets, drugs, and Brooklyn.
He had a strong mom behind him.
But I guess he couldn't survive his fame.

But you could sense the murder of Christopher Wallace hit Brooklyn kids really hard with a heavy punch.
If Barack Obama represents one story of remarkable success for Black Americans, the path taken by the late Christopher Wallace surely represented another.
Rap, hip hop, or whatever you want to call contemporary Black music, has taken the world by storm.
Wallace, yet another achieving kid from Brooklyn, made his mark.

Adventures at the classic old haunts of Manhattan, with justifiable detours.
In recent years, as China has been buffeted by surging violence in the far western region of Xinjiang, foreign journalists seeking analysis from local scholars relied on one man to make sense of news events: Ilham Tohti, the Uighur economics professor who could always be counted on to give an insightful and spirited assessment of the central government’s latest development initiative in Xinjiang — or the most recent “strike hard” security clampdown.
The reliance on one person was not ideal, but pervasive fear long ago persuaded other Uighur academics to keep their mouths shut.
On Tuesday, the Chinese authorities effectively silenced Mr.
Tohti, sentencing him to life in prison on charges of separatism.
Following a two-day trial, the court ruled that Mr.
Tohti had “bewitched and coerced” his students at Minzu University in Beijing into working on Uighur Online, an Internet forum where issues facing China’s Uighur minority could be openly discussed.
What follows are excerpts from a series of interviews I conducted with Mr.
Tohti has a number of relatives working for Xinjiang’s public security apparatus, including an older brother who is the vice director of a prefectural police department.
In the interview, he described how relatives were occasionally sent to Beijing by their employers to persuade him to give up his advocacy work: Having so many relatives working for the police has definitely helped me, but it has mostly hurt them.
I’m sure their careers would be much further along if it were not for me, and this weighs heavily on my conscience.
One brother and my mother aren’t speaking to me at the moment.
They say, “You’re hurting all the children.
” My brother recently came to Beijing to convince me to give up my work.
He cried — all my siblings cry when the subject comes up — and he pleaded with me to stop giving interviews to the foreign media and to stop writing about Xinjiang’s problems.
I feel like I’m under pressure all the time.
It’s not from fear — although I’m always afraid I’ll disappear at any moment — but from frustration and feelings of helplessness.
But this is my life, the one I’ve given myself.
I want to have a normal life, but I can’t.
The most painful thing is the sense that I’ve let down my family.
Tohti was critical of the Chinese news media’s approach to Xinjiang — parroting government propaganda while dutifully ignoring the region’s problems.
But he also took issue with some of the Western media’s coverage of Xinjiang, especially their focus on the religious identity of the Uighur people: The Chinese media’s portrayal of the Uighur people has nothing to do with reality.
I respect and understand that the news media are trying to encourage ethnic harmony, but this approach leaves the voice of Uighur people muffled.
Truth be told, the Uighur people have been forgotten by the world, both by the West and by the Islamic world.
In the Western media, we are often portrayed in the context of Islam.
Islam is our religion, of course, but Uighur history and culture are more than just about religion.
My hope is that people in the West can see us as more than just a “Muslim people.
” In fact, we have little in common with the Islamic, and especially the Arab, world.
Our culture, language and even our faces are different, a fact that is lost on most outsiders.
In fact, if you go to places like Saudi Arabia or Pakistan, you’ll find far more Han than Uighurs.
This is because Uighurs cannot get passports to leave China.
Tohti bemoaned what he described as the widespread fear among Uighurs, who have been cowed into silence by draconian security.
A raft of other restrictions, he also complained, leave Uighurs ignorant about their history, culture and religion: We Uighurs are currently in the infant stage, or even a fetal stage.
We do not know about our rights.
There is a lack of love between us.
There are too few brave souls, too few people who dare to speak the truth.
But the Chinese government says it is “cultivating” the Uighurs.
You are a Uighur, and because you are a Uighur, you are not allowed to keep your identity.
Because you are a Uighur, you have to shave your beard, I can prevent you from reading the Quran.
Because you are a Uighur, you can be discriminated against in the job market.
I see that my people are changing.
Separatism is continuing to strengthen.
Many people have a separatist mentality now.
It is much more prevalent since the 5 July incident [rioting in 2009 that left nearly 200 people dead in Urumqi, the regional capital].
Many problems are caused by the authorities, but I am also worried that many of my people are becoming extremists.
It threatens harmony and is detrimental to resolving Xinjiang’s problems.
This country is bound to repress more people, and in the end, there won’t be any results.
So we can only use peaceful means.
Tohti had an oddly close relationship with public security officials in Beijing, where he lived and worked.
Although he was constantly watched — and sometimes detained and interrogated — he said he was relatively well treated by his minders.
What he feared most was security personnel in Xinjiang, who had long sought to punish him for his outspokenness.
As it happened, after his arrest in January, Mr.
Tohti was sent back to Xinjiang and, according to his lawyers, he was repeatedly mistreated while in police custody.
It seems there’s a lot of competition among the different security branches.
Everyone wants to burnish their reputation by getting such a “big fish.
” They put pressure on me; they tell me to stop bringing international attention to Xinjiang.
Each time I promise them I’ll keep quiet, but then … I have to admit, the security police in Beijing have become almost sympathetic to me.
They are young guys, in their 20s and 30s, just trying to make a living.
At this point, they actually consider me a friend.
Anyway, the other day, the guys assigned to me were really pissed because I spoke to a foreign reporter.
If you fall into the hands of the Xinjiang police, you’ll be in grave danger.
You’re a tiny ant, and you can be killed at any time.
” I’d be lying if I said I’m not afraid.
Every time the doorbell rings, I think they’re coming to get me.
In the beginning, when I was called in by the police, I’d been trembling with fear.
But after all these years of interrogations, my mind has grown stronger.
I’m just worried about my wife and kids, afraid they will be treated unfairly after I’m gone.
Tohti’s sentence, the court ordered the confiscation of all of his assets.

I am here to defend the hedge funds, because, well, somebody has to.
You could sense the glee in the air last week, when the enormous California state pension plan known as Calpers announced that it would eliminate its investing program in hedge funds.
Commentators piled on, some calling hedge funds a doomed asset class helmed by greedy billionaires who overcharge for a too-complex asset.
One columnist argued that “the industry’s best period is likely behind it.
” Another said the “most surprising thing” about the maneuver was that “it took so long.
” Of course the people who operate hedge funds are greedy.
s don’t go into hedge funds to save the world.
Still, the decision by Calpers, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, became a Rorschach test for people to convey their own personal views of hedge funds.
The California pension fund, with more than $300 billion in assets, itself explained the move with a statement by its chief investment officer, Ted Eliopoulos.
“When judged against their complexity, cost and the lack of ability to scale at Calpers’s size,” he said, hedge fund investment by the pension fund “doesn’t merit a continued role.
” The nuances of that statement have been lost.
For hedge fund detractors, the decision by Calpers is a Waterloo and it is only a matter of time before other pension funds and investors join the retreat.
Never mind that hedge fund assets hit $2.
352 trillion as of the second quarter of 2014, according to BarclayHedge, a data provider for hedge fund returns A closer look at the hedge fund industry — and at the Calpers statement — tells a different story.
Let’s start with the issue of complexity.
Hedge funds can indeed be opaque, but some are not that complicated at all.
A simple long-short fund — or a fund that will bet on whether the market goes up or down — may invest in a small number of stocks.
Other hedge funds, to be sure, employ complex trading strategies relying on arcane derivatives and computer programming.
Yet are these any harder to monitor than private equity funds — investments that Calpers will retain.
Additionally, the California pension fund had two advisers to help with its hedge fund investing: the Pacific Alternative Asset Management Company, or Paamco, and UBS.
It seems hard to believe that these experts could not help Calpers navigate the hedge funds’ complexity.
This leaves the fee problem that Mr.
Eliopoulos referred to when he stated that the asset class was “expensive.
” In the fiscal year that ended in June, Calpers paid $135 million in fees for hedge fund investments that earned 7.
Private equity firms typically charge the same amount as hedge funds: a 2 percent administrative fee and 20 percent of the profits, though as is the case with hedge funds, a big institutional investor like Calpers almost certainly gets a discount.
And the pension fund remains fully committed to investing in private equity, with 15 percent of its capital dedicated to the sector, or a total of $31.
Indeed, the pension fund has increased its allocation for private equity in recent years.
In other words, high fees do not seem to deter Calpers when the profits are there.
Neither complexity nor fees appear to explain the exit.
Instead, what does appear to be the reason is simply the one that Calpers gave — the asset class just isn’t working for the pension fund because of the strategy it has taken.
1 percent return on its hedge fund portfolio is acceptable, but paltry when compared with the 18.
4 percent the pension fund earned over all last year.
Hedge funds have always underperformed at Calpers.
The pension giant earned only an average 4.
8 percent annually in the last 10 years from hedge fund investments.
This return is a full 2 percent below the target return that it had set for the asset class.
The poor performance appears to be motivating Calpers to exit hedge funds.
5 percent of its assets were dedicated to investment in hedge funds.
One big reason for investment in hedge funds is to hedge returns.
Hedge funds are intended to perform better when stock markets go down.
But given the relatively small amount invested, Calpers was in hedge funds for the wrong reasons.
And unless the pension fund scaled up its investment by tens of billions of dollars, the hedging aspect of hedge funds could not work.
Not only that, Calpers’s hedge fund strategy itself was lacking.
The pension fund diversified its hedge fund strategies into a variety of classes: long-short, multistrategy, event-driven, international and funds of funds, among others.
With more than 40 different hedge funds, Calpers had trouble picking a winner and had too little money in too many types of funds and strategies.
The pension fund also concentrated in investing in relatively unknown hedge funds, avoiding the megafunds that have earned outsize returns each year, such as Appaloosa or Bridgewater.
In contrast, the Texas teachers’ pension fund has actually bought a stake in Bridgewater itself.
Calpers made an entirely rational decision to exit.
The fees would have been wholly justified if the returns were there.
Don’t feel sorry for hedge funds.
First off, pension funds and other investors that can search for better yields and get the better hedge funds will stay in the business, including not only Texas’ teachers fund but also Massachusetts’s pension fund, which has about 9 percent of its assets in hedge funds.
Second, hedge funds are a victim of market volatility, or the lack thereof.
When markets eventually become more volatile, hedge funds will be back.
The move by Calpers is also a result of its unwillingness to ride the hedge fund craze toward activist investing.
(The pension fund, in any case, gets the benefit of that activism in its stock portfolio.
) Calpers’s exit, then, is really about Calpers and not something broad about hedge funds’ being a “doomed” asset class.
So hedge fund titans, California may just not be that into you, but there are plenty of other starry-eyed, deep-pocketed investors to woo.
Against all odds, the stodgy old National Portrait Gallery has recently become one of the most interesting, daring institutions in Washington.
Its 2009 show on Marcel Duchamp's self-portrayal was important, strange and brave.
"Hide/Seek," the show about gay love that it opened in October, was crucial - a first of its kind - and courageous, as well as being full of wonderful art.
Now the NPG, and the Smithsonian Institution it is part of, look set to come off as cowards.
Tuesday, after a few hours of pressure from the Catholic League and various conservatives, it decided to remove a video by David Wojnarowicz, a gay artist who died from AIDS-related illness in 1992.
As part of "Hide/Seek," the gallery was showing a four-minute excerpt from a 1987 piece titled "A Fire in My Belly," made in honor of Peter Hujar, an artist-colleague and lover of Wojnarowicz who had died of AIDS complications in 1987.
And for 11 seconds of that meandering, stream-of-consciousness work (the full version is 30 minutes long) a crucifix appears onscreen with ants crawling on it.
It seems such an inconsequential part of the total video that neither I nor anyone I've spoken to who saw the work remembered it at all.
But that is the portion of the video that the Catholic League has decried as "designed to insult and inflict injury and assault the sensibilities of Christians," and described as "hate speech" - despite the artist's own hopes that the passage would speak to the suffering of his dead friend.
The irony is that Wojnarowicz's reading of his piece puts it smack in the middle of the great tradition of using images of Christ to speak about the suffering of all mankind.
There is a long, respectable history of showing hideously grisly images of Jesus - 17th-century sculptures in the National Gallery's recent show of Spanish sacred art could not have been more gory or distressing - and Wojnarowicz's video is nothing more than a relatively tepid reworking of that imagery, in modern terms.
Until Tuesday afternoon, museum staff, under Director Martin E.
Sullivan, believed that "Fire" was interesting art that made important points.
And now it looks as though they're somehow saying that they were wrong about that, and that it really was unfit to be seen or shown, after all.
If every piece of art that offended some person or some group was removed from a museum, our museums might start looking empty - or would contain nothing more than pabulum.
The Inquisition called them porn.
Norman Rockwell would get the boot, too, if I believed in pulling everything that I'm offended by: I can't stand the view of America that he presents, which I feel insults a huge number of us non-mainstream folks.
But I didn't call for the Smithsonian American Art Museum to pull the Rockwell show that runs through Jan.
2, just down the hall from "Hide/Seek.
" Rockwell and his admirers got to have their say, and his detractors, including me, got to rant about how much they hated his art.
Censorship would have prevented that discussion, and that's why we don't allow it.
) has said that taxpayer-funded museums should uphold "common standards of decency.
" But such "standards" don't exist, and shouldn't, in a pluralist society.
My decency is your disgust, and one point of museums, and of contemporary art in general, is to test where lines get drawn and how we might want to rethink them.
A great museum is a laboratory where ideas get tested, not a mausoleum full of dead thoughts and bromides.
In America no one group - and certainly no single religion - gets to declare what the rest of us should see and hear and think about.
Aren't those kinds of declarations just what extremist imams get up to, in countries with less freedom.
Of course, it's pretty clear that this has almost nothing to do with religion.
Eleven seconds of an ant-covered crucifix.
This fuss is about the larger topic of the show: Gay love, and images of it.
The headline that ran over coverage of the matter on the right-wing Web site CNSnews.
com mentioned the crucifix - but as only one item in a list of the exhibition's "shockers" that included "naked brothers kissing, genitalia and Ellen DeGeneres grabbing her breasts.
" (Through a bra, one might note, in an image that's less shocking than many moves by Lady Gaga.
) The same site decries "a painting the Smithsonian itself describes in the show's catalog as 'homoerotic'.
" The attack is on gayness, and images of it, more than on sacrilege - even though, last I checked, many states are sanctioning gay love in marriage, and none continue to ban homosexuality.
After years of thwarted efforts to break into banking, Walmart is making its biggest foray yet into everyday financial services.
Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, is teaming up with Green Dot, known for its prepaid payment cards, to supply checking accounts to almost anyone over 18 who passes an ID check.
Daniel Eckert, senior vice president at Walmart, said on Tuesday that the accounts would be available nationwide by the end of October.
The accounts are intended to be low-cost alternatives to traditional bank checking accounts, with no fees for overdrafts or bounced checks and no minimum account balance.
In comparison, a basic checking account at Citibank charges $12 if a check is returned and $34 for overdrafts.
The new accounts from Green Dot, called GoBank, will cost $8.
95 a month if they have direct deposits totaling less than $500 a month.
Eckert said that most people on Social Security or fixed pensions would qualify.
GoBank, as the service is known, is part of Walmart’s long-running push into financial services for people with little or no access to traditional banking.
In recent years, many banks have reduced services to those with weak credit.
According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, an estimated 10 million households in the United States do not use a bank.
Consumer advocates say that many people without checking accounts are forced into the financial hinterlands, where they have little choice but to turn to costly alternatives for basic transactions.
Fees for these services can quickly add up, making saving even more difficult.
In an uneven economic recovery, Walmart is also pushing to win back customers it is losing to lower-price retailers, from T.
Maxx to dollar stores like Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.
On Tuesday, the NPD Group, a market research company, said dollar stores were seeing the largest increase among brick-and-mortar retailers.
“Their core consumer, the lower-end consumer, is faring disproportionately poorly in the overall economy,” said Faye Landes, retail analyst at Cowen, an investment management group.
“So anything they can do to get them back from the dollar stores and back in their own stores makes total sense.
” Walmart has been eyeing financial services for some time.
Two years ago, the company announced a partnership with American Express to offer a prepaid card and debit accounts.
Retailers like Target and 7-Eleven also offer prepaid cards.
But the new Walmart initiative will be the first full-blown, off-the-shelf checking account.
To help attract customers, Walmart and Green Dot will forgo a screening system many banks use to vet potential customers and rely instead on a proprietary system.
The model is expected to allow almost any consumer who passes an identification check to open an account in minutes, according to Green Dot.
In the past, Walmart has tried to secure a federal bank charter to become a deposit-taking bank, but abandoned that effort in 2007 in the face of opposition from the banking industry.
Since then, the retailer has assembled an array of services that could be offered without a charter, as well as partnerships with financial service companies like Green Dot.

From DNA Info: One of the historic millstones on display in Queens Plaza was vandalized recently — renewing a local historian's call to have the pair of artifacts moved from the site.
The two stones, which are located in a park in Queens Plaza called Dutch Kills Green, are estimated to be at least 200 hundreds years old and possibly a relic from a mill that once operated nearby, according to Bob Singleton of the Greater Astoria Historical Society.
Singleton said he was notified by a community member of the vandalism last week.
A photo he snapped of the vandalized millstone shows it was tagged with the word "Patria," in its center, and someone wrote the word "choky" numerous times in what appears to be marker.
The Parks Department removed the graffiti Friday morning, a spokesman said, "using methods recommended by our art and antiquities conservators.
" The department has notified the NYPD and planned to file a police report of the incident.
But Singleton says the vandalism is further proof that the millstones should be moved from the park to an indoor space where they can be preserved — something he's been pushing for years.
The City at this point knows that Queens Plaza is a bad place for the millstones.
Yet they can't bring themselves to admit that.
They can be placed indoors in an accessible location.
But this being Queens, the electeds won't push for that, and will kowtow to the EDC.

We remember the sadness we felt when we heard Ian Faith had died.
But the incredible, shocking and completely undeniable truth is that the legendary manager of such rock groups as Spinal Tap, Salt In Their Wounds and Crusty Panties is alive.
And not only is he alive, but he's talking, exclusively, to Spy contributor Chick Hadrian.
The phone rang, and I answered, and I heard that familiar "Chickie.
" Never had I felt such terror, as would anybody who thought he was talking to a dead man.
Particularly a dead man named Ian Faith.
The memories came flooding back: learning that Faith had overdosed in the Chelsea Hotel; hearing Scott Muni's show on WNEW-FM with Pete Townshend and Ian Anderson reminiscing about the legendary manager.
I also remembered Ian's funeral in Woodlawn, New York.
His most famous proteges, David St.
Hubbins, Derek Smalls and Nigel Tufnel of Spinal Tap, had come, as St.
Hubbins recently admitted to Rolling Stone, "because he owed us a great deal of money.
" Before long they were literally dancing on his grave and, in their celebration, laying plans for their reunion, the one that is engaging the nation today.
As soon as the call came, I knew I had to see him.
I found him in his little bungalow in the Caymans.
After the usual finding-someone-alive-whom-you thought-dead pleasantries, we got down to business.
How — and why — did you pull of this incredible hoax.
Well, my motivation was really the band.
Several years ago the affairs of the band had become.
let's say tangled, and I felt it best to devise some strategy whereby I could take upon myself, uh, the responsibility for these various.
They weren't crimes or anything like that.
Let's put it this way: They were collective indiscretions that I had individually undertaken.
I mean, I had individually undertaken the indiscretions and in some cases committed outright fraud as a representative of the band.
And it was as a representative of the band.
A vote had been taken — at various times, to the best of my recollection — electing me to act as an officer for the band's business.
You were defrauding people on the band's behalf.
I had received advances from interests in Europe and elsewhere for albums that were yet to be recorded.
Such sums get eaten up when you're dealing with a band that has the artistic sweep of a Spinal Tap.
You really can't skimp on the money.
You've got to give them what they need to fulfill their vision.
Fulfilling their vision involved going to certain secluded places so they could work in peace — or, more precisely, my going to certain secluded places so they could work in peace.
Anyway, to make a long story short, this situation was, well, in a way desperate.
And that was when I quite openly — well, not openly as far as everyone was concerned; I was being open with myself — let's say I quite consciously embezzled money.
I actually committed a crime in order to draw attention away form the potentially damaging indiscretions that had been committed by the band collectively, without their knowledge, by me.
Not a lot of managers would make that kind of sacrifice.
No, no — I don't think many would.
My strategy was to put myself in the position where the authorities would blame only me for those apparent crimes, and then kill myself.
And the members of the band could plausibly play dumb.
Still, I do think the band has been very ungrateful.
As it says in the Bible, "Greater love hath no manager than that he lay down his life of his band.
" I guess it takes a certain subtlety of mind to grasp that you would be stealing from someone for their own benefit.
I've always said the band's skills and talents are intuitive, they're not cerebral.
They don't have minds, in the usual sense of the word.
Tell me how you actually pulled off this hoax.
Well, it's remarkably easy to die in New York City.
It did take the cooperation of a good friend and sympathetic ally — a very good friend called Hassan, a gentleman I met in Beirut some years ago.
Let's go back to that day and review it, step-by-step.
We're talking about November 12, 1990.
You were in the Chelsea Hotel, and you'd just completed a three-week binge involving alcohol, drugs of various kinds, sort of setting up— No, not that many kinds.
I mean, I wanted to make it appear that I was overdosing, but really it was only one or two kinds, maybe three.
The point being that you set everybody up to believe you had been indulging by having the appearance of indulging.
Finally, after a few weeks, I went to my room and stuck a syringe in my arm.
I then assumed a dead position.
I had taken this Japanese blowfish stuff, which lays you out so that if you're examined in a rudimentary fashion, like by policemen, you can appear to be dead.
Especially in New York, they have so many corpses.
Hassan then pretended to find my body and reported it to the hotel manager, who of course was distraught.
Well, he wasn't that distraught — this kind of thing happens fairly frequently in the Chelsea — but I had been a good tipper.
Anyway, things became a little bit more complicated.
We couldn't have me taken off to the morgue, so the body — that is, me — had to be replaced by another body.
it was that of a friend I had met during the binge, and he was actually dead.
And that was just a lovely bit of good luck, because this person — Jose.
I can't remember — hadn't been dead when we met.
But what about the open casket at the funeral.
At the undertaker's I was put into a coffin in which Hassan had hidden six scuba tanks, so that when the coffin was closed and I was lowered into the grave, I would be able to survive for several hours.
So that was me, with a rapt smile upon my face, being paid my last respects, which very few people bothered to do.
It must have been difficult for you to hear such derogatory comments from former associates.
I mean, obviously I expected some form of anger — you know, it's a classic survivor thing — but also.
Well, something like grief, at least.
Certainly what I did not expect was the vituperation.
I remember, as the first shovelful of dirt hit the coffin, Tufnel yelling, "Bye, Ian, come back as something I can eat.
I thought they were just stamping down the dirt, but later, of course, it was reported that they were actually dancing.
Dancing, whooping, high-fiving, the works.
Let's talk about what you had been doing after splitting with Spinal Tap before your death.
The one significant undertaking was in Europe.
I was in touch with a friend of mine, a fellow named Danzig.
He's one of those very interesting chaps who deal with six or seven countries at once — you know.
he's doing a feature film in Paris financed with Arab money, and the rock score is being done by some Nazi psycho-metal band he's booking into Sweden — he's one of these postmodern Renaissance men.
Anyway, he was in contact with some moderate Iranians inside Iran who wanted to improve the image of their country.
One scheme was to start up a record company with Iranian money, Moderate Records, and Danzig offered me a chance to join in.
My plan was to assemble an Iranian band that I wanted to call the Mullahs of Invention.
In the end, we did find some Turkish kids in Bremen who looked Iranian, and we bought them a Marshall stack and some Gibson SGs to get them started, but then I found out to my horror that the money that was coming in from Iran wasn't staying in the company.
It was moving right out again in cash, usually in the equipment of Israeli rock bands, to Tel Aviv.
And some days later there would be a new F-14 on a runway in Teheran.
The whole company was a conduit for getting arms into Iran.
Although for a while there, we were in clover, because here we were, with tens of millions of dollars going through the accounts, the richest record company in Europe — and no product.
We didn't have to go out and push anything.
We just had to sit there, basically, picking our noses and getting laid.
I actually thought of it as the pinnacle of my career, because it was sex, drugs, but no rock 'n roll.
I didn't have to spend half my time trying to get some pumped-up little wanker onstage, you know, just to play a set.
But then the American Congress got their knickers in a twist, and the whole thing ground to a crashing halt.
Is this how Spinal Tap's back catalog ended up in Teheran.
Well, this is one of the bones of contention between me and the band.
The thing is, we had this group, the Mullahs, but they didn't have any songs.
But, you see, I was sitting on this huge catalog of songs by this group called Spinal Tap, which for all intents and purposes didn't exist anymore.
So I slipped the songs into Moderate's catalog.
Well, no, not exactly — I more or less actually contributed the catalog in return for my salary.
But that's why there's been contentiousness about where the Spinal Tap catalog is.
I guess you could technically say it's owned by — Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
You know — what's he going to do.
Tell me, Ian — what did you do while you were underground.
Well, it's extremely difficult to trade on one's reputation when one is reputedly dead.
So I kind of had to take what I could get.
And one thing that turned out to be quite lucrative was rights to concessions at skinhead rallies in Europe.
We started out with obvious items, simulated Nazi memorabilia and so forth, but we eventually added pint bottles of gasoline, brass knuckles, T-shirts— T-shirts.
Black Hanes Beefy-T's, no shrinking, good stuff.
I mean, it's not good, in the moral sense.
But I must say I didn't feel very proud of myself for getting involved with the neo-Nazi business, so I did try to offset it with some benefits.
One was an international rock concert for tennis players who've been held hostage by terrorists.
It was — well, it was actually a video more than a — well, it was actually held in a television studio and beamed to many, many places via satellite.
Are there many tennis players held hostage.
And when they are released, there'll be some money for them.
Well, it's like the end of a fallow period.
I'm proposing to some of my fellow veterans that we set up a Traveling Wilburys-type outfit, a sort of Managing Wilburys, that would go around the country orchestrating the careers of groups on the road.
Each band would stay in one place, but we'd be traveling around.
Um, Andrew Loog Oldham, Allen Klein, Malcolm McLaren, perhaps Bill Graham — Bill Graham's dead.
Look, believe what you want, but I've at least been talking to someone calling himself Bill Graham who's an angry sort of fellow who does seem to have some experience in promoting music, and that's good enough for me.
We're thinking of setting up a new Fillmore, the Fillmore South, in Tampa.
Get a very, very big empty place, get a big parking lot, make it the centerpiece of a theme park devoted to the mythos of rock 'n roll.
Are you working with any new groups.
Yes, I'm quite into the world beat.
I've been to South Africa, and I've lined up quite a few interesting musicians.
Like Paul Simon, but very much unlike him as well.
They incorporate a lot of elements not usually found in black African music.
What kind of music do they play.
Sort of military, but with an oompah flavor.
That's just it — a tribute to whichever giant of our business is next to pass.
The great people, let's face it, are hitting 50 and more, which means in days to come they will tend to be dying more frequently.
And what's needed is the ability to organize tributes instantly for rock superstars.
If you look at this Freddie Mercury thing at Wembley, it took months to get that together.
Imagine how much more could have been raised if they could have saluted Freddie while fans were still in the throes of grief.
With my plan we have everything in place, so that as soon as somebody dies, it's all there — the arena, the international hookups, the equipment, the celebrities — so that if, say, Paul McCartney dies tomorrow, I can have a tribute going for him in 24 hours.
I can't mention names at this point, but believe me, the participants are all top-flight people, and the animal-rights people or whoever it is that has Paul's ear — or more appropriately, I suppose, Linda's ear — will be very happy that we'd be there, all organized, before the bloom's off the rose.
Any chance of your getting back with Spinal Tap.
That would be a dream, Chick, to be back with the boys.
I think they could use me — it doesn't seem their album has taken off like the B-1 bomber exactly, now has it.
61, off the chart in five weeks.
Not that it would be easy, but I am the fifth member of Spinal Tap, after all, their Pete Best, Brian Epstein, George Martin and Murray the K all wrapped up in one.
And there are so many memories, so many difficult memories.
Nigel tried to poison me at one point.
Typical Tufnel—he used a bright-blue crystalline rat poison and put it on my salad.
I mean, it shows up, blue does.
So there's a lot of history there.
Yes, but the point I want to make is that everything I did — the embezzlement, the fraud, the illegal transfers, the skimming — was really my way of saying, "I love you, Tap.
" I'm very fond of our body of work together, our oeuvre, even though logging 24-hour days for years on end for a band is not the easiest way to lead a life that could have been very creative in its own right.
I mean, I had my own dreams, you know, that I put on hold.
All I want to say is that if they want to make the first move, then I'm here to serve, as I always have been.
Then we'll have to take the appropriate legal action.
As the co-curators of the indie apothecary MiN New York in NoLita, Chad Murawczyk and Mindy Yang take a simple approach to stocking their shelves: “If we can’t find something we want, we make it,” Murawczyk says.
So far, that’s lead to such varied creations as atmospheric candles gilded in precious metals, high-performance skin-care creams and hand-ticked silk scarves depicting photographs of Havana shot by Murawczyk himself.
The latest addition to the MiN oeuvre: a series of abstract fragrances, called Scent Stories, debuting this week.
Composed of notes that normally don’t land in eau, such as pencil shavings and ozone, the collection of 11 unisex scents took a year to develop with a master perfumer in Grasse, France.
“The idea was to make each scent like a chapter or a short story: it would be vivid, visceral and disconnected from the others, but take you somewhere,” Yang says.
Indeed, many of the fragrances were inspired by the pair’s own memories and journeys.
Dahab, for example, evokes the deserts and deep seas of Egypt where Murawczyk spent time.
“It’s incense-y, smoky and mysterious,” he says of the saffron-, cumin- and nutmeg-laced blend.
Yang, who is also a trained reiki healer, is particularly drawn to Shaman, describing it as a “futurist nomad” scent, with a “mystical air.
” The violet leaf note is especially nuanced, she says, and conveys “a sense of clairvoyance.
” Another unconventional aspect of the collection: Initially it will only be available to a curated audience, or those who are invited to become “members” of the apothecary.
“We really think of these as works of art in a gallery, so we’re making everything in small batches,” Yang explains.
Membership is free (granted you fill out an application) and is intended for “elite collectors, influencers, top customers and anyone really in tune with their senses,” she says.
Those who make the cut (there are 1,000 slots available in total — hurry.
) will have exclusive access to the scents — which are kept in the back room of the apothecary and hand poured into glass bottles — for a year before they’re unveiled to the public.
Murawczyk and Yang also plan to tour the Scent Stories collection, much like a traveling exhibition, to select perfumeries in Paris and Rome, where you can sniff by invitation only, of course.
[Aluminaire House on the campus of the New York Insitute of Technology via Curbed NY] Palm Springs, home to enough wonderful Modernist buildings to devote a week to them each year, is hoping to add to its collection with a famous transplant all the way from New York: Aluminaire House, by Albert Frey and A.
The Desert Sun reports that the mayor of Palm Springs is heading up the effort to raise $600,000 to disassemble, transport, and reassemble the iconic, all-metal house in the desert town where Frey lived and where many of his most famous works (the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway station, the Tramway Gas Station, Palm Springs City Hall) still stand today.
The 1931 prefab Aluminaire is acknowledged as the US's first all-metal house and likely the nation's first prefab house.
Frey and Kocher (then the managing editor of Architectural Record) exhibited it at a show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where it was admired by both critics and the public.
Made entirely of donated materials and originally assembled in just 10 days, it's been called one of the "the pivotal works of modern architecture in America.
" Created for the purpose of demonstrating that Modernist architecture could be made for middle-class families, it is also largely credited with bringing the International Style, already popular in Europe, to the US.
Regardless of its illustrious past, the once-famed structure is presently homeless since New York's Landmarks Preservation Commission rejected a proposal in January to put the house and two condo buildings on a corner in Queens—much to the delight of locals who were very vocal about not wanting them there.
Palm Springs is working with the Aluminaire House Foundation, helmed by two architects who were principals at the firm trying to incorporate the building into that development.
It's not yet clear where in Palm Springs the structure would go (an area near the Palm Springs Art Museum has been proposed preliminarily), but there's no question that the city would be thrilled to add such a heavy-hitter to its architectural arsenal: "The Aluminaire is on the list of some of the most important buildings in the country, on a par with Fallingwater or the Farnsworth House.
So it's a really interesting prospect to bring it to Palm Springs, where people can enjoy it, along with the rest of Albert Frey's work," a Palm-Springs-area preservationist says.

Except for The Learning Network (see below), The New York Times does not knowingly collect or store any personal information about children under the age of 13.
The Learning Network is a free service for parents, teachers and students, and does not require registration.
The Student Connections section is specifically directed at students, grades 6 to 12.
Within this section, the Ask a Reporter page and the Student Letters page allow students to either send a question to a Times reporter or submit a letter to the editor, providing their first name, grade, state/country and, optionally, their email address.
The information requested on these pages is used solely for participation in these activities, and is not shared or sold to third parties.
If an email address is provided, it will only be used for a one-time response back to the child.
After responding to the child, the email address is deleted.
Access to the above services is not conditioned on more information than is reasonably necessary to provide the services.
Because we're concerned about a parent's right to consent to the collection and use of their child's personal information, when a question or letter is published, only the student's first name, grade and state/country appear on the site.
To request removal of this information (non-personally identifiable) or to review or remove the optional email address (personal information collected), please use this form to contact the Learning Network.
These children's guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technology evolves rapidly and that underlying business models are still not established.
Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change.
In the unlikely event of such changes they will be posted on this page.
If the changes represent a material departure from our current practice with respect to the use of children's personal information, the changes will be posted on this page thirty days prior to taking effect and will not affect children's personal information previously collected.

Earlier this morning, the MTA announced that they will be purchasing 120 new buses.
Here is more via the official press release: This contract is subject to the review and approval of the Office of the New York State Comptroller (OSC) and the contract award will not be made prior to this approval.
The delivery of the low floor 40-foot diesel production buses is scheduled to begin in June 2015 and be completed in September 2015.
The delivery of the low floor 60-foot articulated diesel production buses is scheduled to begin in October 2015 and be completed in June of the following year.
The combined total award to New Flyer is $80,072,520.
The price per bus for the 40-foot bus is $496,267 and the contract includes special tools, manuals, training and spare parts for a total contract amount of $22,737,553.
The price per bus for the 60-foot bus is $755,074 and also includes special tools, testing, manuals, training and spare parts for a total contract amount of $57,334,968.
“These new buses will be a real benefit for our customers who will find them more comfortable and convenient than older models,” said Darryl Irick, President of MTA Bus Company.
This will be the first time that low-floor articulated equipment will be used on MTA Bus Company routes.
Low-floor bus design makes it easier and faster for customers to board and exit, both speeding service and eliminating the need for customers to negotiate steps.
Customers who must use wheelchairs also find low-floor buses to be more convenient as they utilize a front-door ramp rather than a rear-door lift.
As part of the ongoing effort to modernize the nation’s largest municipal bus fleet, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is seeking Board approval next week to award federally funded contracts to bus manufacturer New Flyer of America (New Flyer) for the delivery of 120 new low-floor transit buses, to be used by MTA Bus Company.
The award consists of two contracts for 75 low floor 60-foot articulated diesel buses and 45 low floor 40-foot diesel buses.

With the turnout expected to be big this Sunday for the People Climate March, MTA NYC Transit will be adding extra service to the &.
Also some bus routes will be rerouted.
Here are the details: In order to prevent overcrowding on stairways and platforms at subway stations along Central Park West, 34 St-Penn Station and 34 St-Herald Sq, some subway stairways may be designated as “entrance or exit only.
” However, additional service will be provided on the E line between Manhattan and Queens as well as on the S 42nd Street Shuttle.
Bronx-bound D trains will run local between 59 St-Columbus Circle and 125 St.
Additionally, due to scheduled weekend work, subway commuters are reminded that 7 train service will be suspended between 74 St-Broadway and 42 St-Times Sq in both directions.
The following NYC Transit and MTA Buses that serve the area will be affected by reroutes and customers should anticipate some delays: M5, M7, M10, M11, M12, M20, 34 SBS, M34A SBS, M42, M66, M72, and M104.
The People’s Climate March will be held on Sunday, September 21, between 11:30 a.
The March’s route will begin at Central Park West, between 65 St and 86 Sts, with participants travelling through Midtown and Times Square, ending at 11 Av between 34 St and 38 St, near the Jacob K.
Attendance could reach upwards of 60,000 people for this event.
Earlier today, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the state will receive $1.
915 billion in storm resiliency funding from the federal government.
6 billion of the funding will go to the MTA.
Here are the details: Governor Andrew M.
Cuomo today announced that New York State expects to receive $1.
The funding from the Federal Transit Administration will support the Governor’s goal of improving the State’s storm resiliency and building back better in the aftermath of major storms.
“Adjusting to the new reality of extreme weather is a collaborative effort, and the more than $1.
9 billion awarded today by the federal government will help us build a stronger and more resilient New York,” Governor Cuomo said.
“Superstorm Sandy taught us the importance of preparing for the worst and the need to reimagine our state to meet the challenges of a changing climate.
Over the past few years we’ve focused on everything from storm-proofing homes and electrical stations to protecting subway entrances and other vital infrastructure from the effects of major flooding.
This funding will ensure that our State has the resources it needs to continue building back stronger and better than ever before.
915 billion in funding from the Federal Transit Administration, approximately $1.
6 billion supports projects managed by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and approximately $212 million supports projects managed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The New York City Department of Transportation is also expected to approximately $200 million.
MTA Chairman and CEO Thomas Prendergast said, “With each passing day, the MTA puts Superstorm Sandy further behind us as we restore service and repair our infrastructure.
But we also know that similar events are ahead, so we are building back better, making our transportation network stronger, more resistant to major storms and thus more resilient.
This is a new way of thinking at the MTA and one which must become a permanent feature of how we plan the future of the transportation system that is the backbone of our regional and state economy.
” Port Authority Executive Director Pat Foye said, “Under Governor Cuomo’s leadership the Port Authority has committed to building back better and more resilient in the face of extreme weather events.
Today’s FTA Tier 3 awards allow us to move forward on critical resiliency projects at the WTC Transportation Hub and Moynihan Station, both vitally important to the regional transportation network and the New York State economy.
I thank Governor Cuomo for his steadfast commitment to protecting New York and the region from future super storms.
” Superstorm Sandy’s tidal surge inundated yards throughout the system, damaging power and communications systems, switches, signals and track, sometimes flooding into tunnels to further damage assets.
This project will protect ten rail yards in flood-prone areas with a design to meet or exceed the 100-year design standard, improving perimeter protection, drainage improvements and pumping.
The yards are in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens and support the entire New York City subway system with facilities for repair, cleaning, maintenance, restoration and storage of thousands of subway cars.
The MTA has identified more than 500 openings serving stations in Lower Manhattan alone which allow water into the subway system.
These necessary openings, such as stairwells, elevators, escalators, sidewalk vents and manholes – through which millions of gallons of salt water entered the system during Sandy – will receive fixed or deployable emergency flood covers.
The severe storm surge during Sandy caused extensive damage, including more than three miles of flooded rail line across Jamaica Bay and a quarter mile breach that disrupted service, and necessitated a seven month shut-down of the subway link to the Rockaways.
Work to date includes a steel seawall to protect against future storm surges.
However, two flood prone stations and other assets critical to the Rockaway Line require protection and flood mitigation: Howard Beach Station and Broad Channel Station, the right of way between the stations and related substations and a relay room.
Further improvements will include a new signaled crossover at Beach 105 Street Station to provide service flexibility after storms.
River to River Rail Resiliency for Long Island Rail Road and Amtrak ($81 million): This project is a joint effort by two of the nation’s largest railroads with the support of New Jersey Transit to protect the rail tunnels and yard system that serve the railroads and ensure the connectivity of service on both commuter railroads and the entire northeast corridor.
The affected assets range from the western portals of the North River Tunnels in Weehawken to the eastern portals of the East River Tunnels in Queens and include Penn Station and the West Side Yards, a system through which some 560,000 commuters travel each weekday.
This funding will support the upgrading of New York City Transit’s Emergency Booth Communications system to allow faster and more reliable emergency communications to customers and among personnel during emergencies.
The system will provide instant two-way communication between stations and the Rail Control Center.
The project also includes a Backup Power Control Center to minimize risk of power outages and will also enhance backup systems to the Rail Control Center, the nerve center of the subway system, and central control for dispatching and monitoring all subway service.
This yard was restored to service following Superstorm Sandy with temporary measures, but requires permanent protections and repairs in order to be relied upon by the total daily LIRR ridership of approximately 250,000 commuters.
This project will prevent incursion of water through three vulnerable tunnel portals, at 148th Yard in Manhattan, 207th Street Yard in Manhattan and Hunters Point in Queens, as well as an internal stairway at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue that is subject to flooding.
• Hardening of Substations ($112 million) – This project will seal access hatches and manholes in underground substations and above ground buildings at 29 locations.
• Pumping Capacity ($24 million) – This project will finance additional pump car conversions to enhance the system’s current storm water pumping capacity and add mobile deployable pumping equipment, mobile generators and equipment at 11 new pump sites at critical locations.
• Right-of-Way Equipment Hardening ($64 million) – This project involves improvements to 17 circuit break houses, 78 pump rooms, 65 signal rooms and towers, including installation of watertight doors, conduit sealing and drains with backflow preventers.
• Internal Station Hardening ($20 million) – This project involves improvements at 54 signal, communications and other equipment locations, including watertight doors and conduit sealing.
• Flood Resiliency for Critical Bus Depots ($45 million) – This project involves drainage, flood gates, deployable barriers and other equipment to prevent water intrusion to vulnerable bus depots.
• Metro North Power and Signals Resiliency ($38 million) – This project involves elevating and waterproofing power and communications equipment, primarily along the Hudson Line.
• Flood Resiliency for NYC Transit Critical Support Facilities ($24 million) – This project involves perimeter protection for warehouses, bus maintenance, and other facilities.
The Port Authority received $84.
675 million for its World Trade Center site Flood Mitigation and Resiliency Program.
The program offers significant flood protection improvements to secure the site, the WTC PATH Terminal and other nearby intermodal transit connections from future catastrophic storm events.
Specific measures taken by the program include modifications to adapt many of the WTC’s street level bollards to accommodate installation of flood barrier panels, localized structures below grade to protect essential mechanical and electrical equipment and other essential operational systems and enhanced water collection, drainage systems.
Governor Cuomo received an overview of the program during his visit to the WTC site on the one-year anniversary of Superstorm Sandy.
In 2012 the WTC construction site was inundated with millions of gallons of water from storm surges during Superstorm Sandy, forcing crews to work around the clock to de-water the site in order to resume construction within days.
2 million was awarded to protect critical life safety and electrical equipment in the Penn-Moynihan Station Complex from catastrophic damages during heavy rains and future superstorms.
The funding will be used to waterproof the existing concrete moat slab and sidewalk, and to install a green roof with irrigation on the moat slab.
The funding will also help to protect critical electrical equipment, mitigating a potential loss in rail service along the most heavily traveled rail corridor in the nation and preserving existing electrical and life safety systems being installed as part of the first phase of the Moynihan Station project.
The Port Authority also received nearly $87 million in funding for projects to protect PATH rail facilities from future storm events.

Eating fish is associated with an increase in brain volume, but it is apparently not because of its omega-3 content, a new study of older adults has found.
Large trucks continue to use Grand and Flushing avenues in Maspeth after the city Department of Transportation instituted a traffic plan last summer prohibiting the trucks from barreling through those streets, business owners on the commercial strip said Friday.
The bypass plan was designed to route trucks that enter and exit the Long Island Expressway around the commercial and largely residential portion of Maspeth.
Instead of using Grand and Flushing avenues, the trucks now travel down 58th Street and travel up Maurice Avenue.
The plan, developed by the city Department of Transportation, was approved in July by Community Board 5 after nearly a decade of debate.
“They come by anyway, regardless,” said Al Elayni of Carpetorium Inc.
& Decoration, at 64-12 Flushing Ave.
“I haven’t noticed much of a difference.
” Delivery trucks are exempt from the regulations.
“Trucks used to get parked up here and got stuck until the cops came and sorted it out,” Elayni said.
“It’s not like a remarkable difference” since the new rules went into effect, he said.
While most businesses on Grand and Flushing approve of the plan, a worker at a motorcycle shop said the regulations were a hardship.
“How are we going to get our shipments.
” asked an employee of Zoom, at 63-18 Flushing Ave.
An employee of Grand Florist, at 65-37 Grand Ave.
, said police have their hands full with enforcing the bypass plan.
“Once a week the cops are here pulling everybody over,” he said.

The country’s system for handling end-of-life care is largely broken and should be overhauled at almost every level, a national panel concluded in a report released on Wednesday.
The 21-member nonpartisan committee, appointed by the Institute of Medicine, the independent research arm of the National Academy of Sciences, called for sweeping change.
“The bottom line is the health care system is poorly designed to meet the needs of patients near the end of life,” said David M.
Walker, a Republican and a former United States comptroller general, who was a chairman of the panel.
“The current system is geared towards doing more, more, more, and that system by definition is not necessarily consistent with what patients want, and is also more costly.
” Many of the report’s recommendations could be accomplished without legislation.
For example, the panel urged insurers to reimburse health care providers for conversations with patients on advance care planning.
Medicare, which covers 50 million Americans and whose members account for about 80 percent of deaths each year, is considering doing just that, prompted by a recent request from the American Medical Association.
Some private insurers are already covering such conversations, and many more would if Medicare did.
But some recommendations — like changing the reimbursement structure so that Medicare would pay for home health services instead of emphasizing hospital care, and so that Medicaid would provide better coverage of long-term care for the frail elderly — would require congressional action.
“We know that there may be a need for new legislation to be introduced to accomplish that, and we recognize that that’s harder to accomplish in a politically charged environment,” said Dr.
Pizzo, a former dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine and the committee’s other chairman.
The panel, which included doctors, nurses, insurers, religious leaders, lawyers and experts on aging, said Medicare and other insurers should create financial incentives for health care providers to have continuing conversations with patients on advance care planning, possibly starting as early as major teenage milestones like getting a driver’s license or going to college.
It called for a “major reorientation and restructuring of Medicare, Medicaid and other health care delivery programs” and the elimination of “perverse financial incentives” that encourage expensive hospital procedures when growing numbers of very sick and very old patients want low-tech services like home health care and pain management.
And it said that medical schools and groups that accredit and regulate health providers should greatly increase training in palliative care and set standards so that more clinicians know how to compassionately and effectively treat patients who want to be made comfortable but avoid extensive medical procedures.
The 507-page report, “Dying in America,” said its recommendations would improve the quality of care and better satisfy more patients and families.
It also said the changes would produce significant savings that would help make health care more affordable.
“If you meet their needs, treat their pain, treat their depression, get them some help in the house, your costs plummet,” said Dr.
Meier, a committee member and the director of the Center to Advance Palliative Care.
Fewer patients would end up in emergency rooms getting expensive care they do not want, she said, adding, “It’s a rare example in health policy of doing well by doing good.
” The report’s linking of end-of-life choices to economic savings is likely to fuel criticism that the medical establishment and insurers will subtly pressure people to reject life-sustaining treatment in order to save money.
This idea ignited intense controversy and killed a proposal for advance care planning in the Affordable Care Act when Sarah Palin and other conservatives raised the specter of government “death panels.
” One critic, Burke Balch, the director of the National Right to Life Committee’s Powell Center for Medical Ethics, said in a statement, “The report’s emphasis on cost-slashing will intensify, rather than calm, the well-founded fears of older people and those with disabilities that the renewed push for government funding and promotion of advance care planning is less about discovering and applying their own wishes than about pushing them to accept premature deaths.
Schaeffer, a panel member who founded the insurance company WellPoint and is a professor at the University of Southern California, said the committee’s most “radical conclusion” was that there should be a more pronounced shift away from fee-for-service medicine, which promotes an emphasis on medical interventions in part by reimbursing doctors based on procedures rather than for talking with patients.
“That’s all got to be changed,” he said at a public briefing.
“And if you can’t do it with current law, guess what.
Pizzo said that in surveys of doctors about their own end-of-life preferences, “a vast majority want to be at home and as free of pain as possible, and yet that’s not what doctors practice.
” Palliative care skills should be extensively taught in medical, nursing and social work schools, the panel recommended, something that Dr.
Meier said would “require a revolution in health care education.
” Many doctors are uncomfortable or ill equipped when it comes to broaching the subject.
To ensure consistency and quality of palliative care, there should be “pretty dramatic change in all the certifying boards, accrediting boards and regulatory entities,” Dr.
5 million cost of the committee’s two years of work was financed by an anonymous donor who had no control over who served on the panel or over the report.
The donor recently approved additional funding for a yearlong public education campaign.
The panel said that simply completing advance directives could have limited value because checking boxes does not accommodate the wide range of choices that an increasingly diverse American population wants.
It said the system should be comprehensive, with medical wishes communicated to all of a patient’s providers and with access to palliative care and other support available around the clock.
“Patients don’t die in the manner they prefer,” Dr.
Dzau, the Institute of Medicine’s president, said at the briefing.
“The time is now for our nation to develop a modernized end-of-life care system.

It’s often said that the ghost of Sid Vicious hangs out around the first-floor elevator at the Chelsea Hotel.
Current resident Ed Hamilton may have also spotted the spectre of Thomas Wolfe.
Today’s Daily News adds a new twist to the hotel’s haunted lore: Swanky Star Lounge, located in the hotel’s basement, has lately seen a rash of strange events, including an unexplained power outage.
After sawing through the ceiling, workers reached a tangle of wiring that had been rearranged.
"We had to cut the drywall to get to these wires, and they were switched," says [owner Charles] Ferri.
"How could anyone even get to these wires.
" The incident prompted Ferri, a skeptic, to reexamine a string of odd happenings.
Lights had routinely flicked on and off.
Odd noises could sometimes be heard from the bar’s back-room office, but ceased upon inspection.
Once, the furniture in the locked lounge was rearranged overnight.
A visiting self-proclaimed psychic told Ferri that she sensed the presence of an older woman in the bar.
"If they bought enough bottles," Mr.
Ferri said of the phantoms, "I would for sure let them have the space.

(CBSNewYork) — A fox that bit at least five people in East Windsor, Connecticut earlier this week has tested positive for rabies.
CBS 2 sister station WFSB-TV in Hartford confirmed that the animal was confirmed to be rabid.
The fox attacked on an elementary school playground Monday in East Windsor.
The fox came out of the woods near Broad Brook Elementary School on Rye Street and then appeared on the playground during recess, WCBS 880 Connecticut Bureau Chief Fran Schneidau reported.
The fox bit one of the children and then bit two school staff members who came to the child’s aid, police said.
The child, second grader Evan Witzke, was bitten on the ankle and wrist.
“We were having gym outside, and we were playing this game, and I was running around, and this fox just came out after me,” Evan said.
Gym teacher Elissa Danielle told WFSB she was bitten on the hand.
That’s my student,” Danielle told the station.
“I would do anything for my students.
” A teacher and another school employee held the fox down by covering it with a receptacle, Windsor police Detective Matthew Carl said.
When police and an animal control worker arrived, they attempted to catch the animal, but it was shot and killed when it tried to attack an officer, Carl said.
Two others have since reported being bitten by the same fox.
Local police told WFSB that Jerry Banks, 74, called them and said he had been bitten while getting his newspaper around 8:30 a.
Monday on Church Street in East Windsor.
The same fox was also believed to have bitten another woman in nearby Windsor Locks at 10:30 a.
, about an hour before attacking the students and staffers at the school, police said.
School counseling was made available for any student that witnessed the incident, WFSB reported.
Any families in need of assistance were advised to contact the Broad Brook Elementary School at (860) 623-2433.

David Drumm, second from left, chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank, was angry at Irish government delays in releasing money after a government guarantee was offered in September of 2008.
The Irish bank bailout in the fall of 2008 was the first one to hit a euro zone country during the credit crisis, and it set some unfortunate precedents.
Now we learn that it was based in no small part on manipulative lies by venal bankers.
The leak of audiotapes of phone conversations between top officials of Anglo Irish Bank, which was by far the worst of a very bad lot, has stunned Ireland and damaged its relations with Germany.
It now appears that the bank lied to Irish officials about how much trouble it was in when the government, at the end of September 2008, guaranteed all the bank’s liabilities.
On one tape, John Bowe, Anglo Irish’s director of the treasury, conceded that he had no rational basis for telling the government that 7 billion euros was all it would take to rescue the bank.
“If they saw the enormity of it up front, they might decide, they might decide they have a choice,” he said to his colleagues in a tape disclosed by The Irish Independent.
“They might say the cost to the taxpayer is too high.
” It was important for the problem to look “big enough to be important, but not too big that it kind of spoils everything.
” The problem certainly did “spoil everything” and continues to do so.
The Anglo Irish bailout turned out to cost tens of billions of euros from Irish taxpayers and the European Union.
Had Irish officials acted more wisely then, the country would still be in bad shape now, but the cost to the government would be much lower.
There probably would have been less need for the continuing austerity that has, once again, caused Ireland to lapse into recession.
But by then, the basic problem had been created.
Ireland had inflated a property bubble far greater than the American one, and losses were going to be immense when prices collapsed.
Regulators were clueless, or worse, about what was actually happening.
There seems to have been no one in the government who was truly familiar with the bank.
Outside experts were called in, but it is not easy during a crisis to evaluate something from scratch.
At the time, however, it was easy to think that the situation was not as bad as it turned out to be.
Irish real estate prices had not collapsed — that would come soon — and it seemed possible that the problems affecting Irish banks, particularly Anglo Irish, were temporary.
If that was the only problem a bank had — if there was a temporary difficulty in raising money to reassure depositors but the underlying loans were solid — then a bailout could work with little or no long-term cost.
But if the real problem was one of solvency, a bailout risked throwing good money after bad.
Two weeks before the Irish bank guarantee, the financial world was shaken by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the United States.
It showed that large financial institutions were interconnected in ways that no one had really considered before and quickly led to a consensus that the American government had erred in not somehow keeping Lehman afloat.
We now know that Lehman was broke, but at the time it appeared to have ample capital.
What was missing, one leading American regulator assured me at the time, was a requirement that the bank retain sufficient liquidity to deal with a panic.
In that atmosphere, it may be understandable that Irish officials fell for the tempting story that there was no real problem, just a bit of unfounded panic.
But once they did, the power shifted to the bankers.
The tapes show that the bankers were furious about government delays in releasing money once the guarantee was offered.
“You’re putting the government at risk with your delays,” said David Drumm, Anglo Irish’s chief executive, in discussing what he would say to officials at a meeting.
Talk of due diligence was ridiculous.
Ireland had told the world “we’re all solvent.
” Now, it should simply write “a two or three billion check and get on with it.
” He described such a check as “very small.
” Relative to the ultimate cost, he was right.
With the guarantee in place, Anglo Irish felt comfortable seeking deposits across Europe.
After all, it was guaranteed by the government of Ireland, rated AAA at the time.
Who cared if that upset German officials angry that their banks would have to pay more to keep deposits.
Bowe began singing “Deutschland über Alles.

Price: $7,800,000 The Skinny: This simulation of English country living can be found on nearly five acres of bucolic land just 18 miles north of Manhattan.
Built in the Jazz Era, the manor has been sensitively updated, adding in modern amenities while preserving the 1920s charm inherent to its leaded and stained glass windows, tracery ceilings, and nine fireplaces.
The lovely red-brick of the exterior extends to the five bay garage and a single-family gatehouse, and the buildings are swaddled in gardens and flagstone terraces.
The estate, which last sold in 2000 for an almost unfathomably low $670,000, is asking $7.
The Catalina Island Conservancy recently released its 20 year master plan, chock full of proposals to help make Catalina more of a tourist destination (and raise money for conservation and education).
The Conservancy has purchased the century-old Catherine Hotel and plans to refurbish the building into a tourism hub with a restaurant, gift shop, and ticket sales for local attractions.
They also plan upgrades to the Airport in the Sky terminal and runways; a "Green Ribbon" of exhibits, art, and native plantings that would "stretch from the Cabrillo Mole through town and up Avalon Canyon to the Garden"; and a circular stage in front of the Wrigley Memorial, according to Catalina Island Online News.
But here is the best part: they also want to build a 10 to 15 minute gondola ride from the Wrigley Memorial and Botanic Garden to an observation deck up on a ridgeline at Divide Road--it'd be powered by a solar collection disc called "Earthrise," that would be visible "from the Channel side of the Island as a blue, half-round, sliver above the Wrigley Memorial.
" The plan was developed by the architecture firm William McDonough + Partners and the landscape architecture firm Nelson Byrd Woltz.

From Willets Point United: The New York City Economic Development Corporation has solicited developer firms to implement the Willets Point development, on the basis of a Request for Proposals ("RFP") that contains NO living wage provision.
However, that plainly contradicts the announcements and testimony of union officials during 2008.
This 4-minute video compilation shows union officials during 2008 announcing, and testifying to the New York City Council on the record regarding, an agreement that requires a living wage provision to be included in the Request for Proposals seeking developer firms to implement the Willets Point development.
No matter what the unions may now have us believe, it is quite clear from this video that: (1.
) The unions unequivocally state that a living wage provision is "guaranteed" and "required" to be included in the Willets Point RFP, and that this has been memorialized in a written and signed agreement (i.
, there is no wiggle room); (2.
) The agreement to include a living wage provision in the Willets Point RFP was "critical to labor's support on this [Willets Point] project"; (3.
) The agreement was consistent with the ideology of the local City Council member (Hiram Monserrate), without whose consent approval of the proposed Willets Point development would have been unlikely; (4.
) The local City Council member forewarned that in the future, the City of New York might attempt to avoid implementing agreed labor provisions, but that the City must honor its commitments to labor and to the City Council; (5.
) The City Council requested, and union officials agreed to provide to the City Council, a copy of the written agreement pertaining to the the inclusion of a living wage provision within the Willets Point RFP.
Therefore, that agreement is part of the record on which the City Council based its decision to approve the proposed Willets Point development.
Now that the City has reneged on its commitment to include a living wage provision within the Willets Point RFP, who will challenge this.
Will the unions -- whose agreement apparently has been violated by the City -- bring a lawsuit to require a new RFP that includes a living wage provision.
Or, were union officials exaggerating, or perhaps deceiving themselves, during 2008.
It is a fact of life that job and career can be stressful.
But some occupations also take a physical toll: persistent aching, throbbing or tingling in the hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder or neck.
These insidious soft-tissue ailments — variously known as repetitive strain injuries, cumulative trauma disorders or work-related musculoskeletal disorders — include the debilitating nerve injury of carpal tunnel syndrome and the inflamed tendons of tendinitis.
They not only can cripple a person’s ability to earn a living.
They may also make it difficult even to twist the lid off a jar, wash the dishes or turn the steering wheel.
Therapies like steroid injections, pain relievers or surgery can go a long way in alleviating pain.
But treatments do not always offer a definitive cure, and injuries can recur.
Prevention is therefore paramount.
To reduce the risk of injury, many workplaces, with help from researchers, have adopted ergonomic interventions: measures that tailor equipment or job routines to accommodate the human body.
But while real-world success stories abound, scientists are still sorting through the evidence to determine which ergonomic measures really work.
Each year, more than 100,000 new cases of upper-extremity ailments are reported to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
Problems are especially common among those who do heavy or frequent manual handling and lifting tasks, whether in manufacturing, construction, meatpacking or nursing care.
But repetitive strain injuries are perhaps most infamously associated with computer use.
Widespread media coverage in the late 1980s and early ’90s described an emerging plague of wrist pain from carpal tunnel syndrome in computer keyboard operators, writers and other office workers.
Skepticism arose over whether tapping on a keyboard, or other more forceful repetitive motions, could result in so much discomfort and disability.
In the years since, researchers have established that exerting the hands, arms or shoulders in tasks that require high levels of force, many repetitions, awkward postures or high amounts of vibration increases the risk of musculoskeletal disorders.
But research in the last decade has established that carpal tunnel syndrome is “not as common in computer users as people have believed — in the absence of good evidence — that it was,” said Dr.
Gerr, an occupational medicine physician and ergonomics investigator at the University of Iowa in Iowa City.
And whether typing actually causes that disorder remains controversial, with some recent studies calling into question any significant connection.
Nonetheless, he added, “The epidemiological evidence is overwhelming that the more people type, the more pain they have.
” Neck and shoulder pain is the most common upper-extremity musculoskeletal problem among computer users.
In a 2002 study tracking 632 computer users newly hired at major Atlanta companies, Dr.
Gerr and colleagues observed that roughly 60 percent developed neck or shoulder pain in the first year, though the study did not track how long symptoms persisted.
About 40 percent reported hand or arm symptoms, mostly from tendinitis.
Only 1 percent developed carpal tunnel syndrome.
Younger generations growing up in the digital age are likewise joining the ranks of the typing wounded.
Surveys at two universities found that 40 to 50 percent of undergraduates experience upper-extremity pain from using their computers.
Colleges do not build dormitory furniture to be ergonomically adjustable, said Dr.
Benjamin Amick, scientific director of the Institute for Work and Health in Toronto, who was a co-author of those studies.
“They build it to be indestructible.
” In the business sector, many companies have made significant ergonomic improvements to the work environment, particularly in office and manufacturing settings, experts said.
The idea is to minimize the stresses on hands, arms and shoulders.
For instance, in offices since the ’90s, thick keyboards with stiff keys have given way to thinner, softer-touch versions.
More attention is also paid to proper positioning of the keyboard, monitor and chair and to alternative types of computer mice.
And in some automobile manufacturing plants, companies have modified assembly-line equipment to take some of the physical load off workers, along with making changes to rotate employees along the line.
Employers are “recognizing that you need variety in the motions that you do, rather than constantly using the same exact muscles and nerves and tendons,” said Barbara Silverstein, research director at the Safety and Health Assessment and Research for Prevention program of the Washington State labor department.
In a soon-to-be published analysis of data from more than 5,000 Washington companies surveyed in 1998, 2001 and 2003, Dr.
Silverstein found that businesses that reported implementing ergonomic measures also saw a decrease in musculoskeletal injuries and absenteeism rates.
In addition, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of repetitive strain cases per 10,000 full-time workers dropped from a high of 41 in 1994 to 24 in 2001.
(The agency has stopped tracking data in this category of “repeated trauma” disorders.
) However, some researchers say that the data is unreliable and undercounts all occupational injuries and illnesses, because of problems with underreporting and with changes in recordkeeping requirements.
Meanwhile, scientists are seeking to build a base of rigorous evidence for ergonomic prevention strategies to convince skeptics of their value.
But so far, reviews of the research have turned up limited or conflicting proof of positive benefits from such measures as stretching exercises or various workstation adjustments for computer users.
A major difficulty is that although many studies have demonstrated ergonomic measures to be helpful, few have been the kind of large, high-quality randomized controlled trials that provide clear-cut answers, said Dr.
David Rempel, an ergonomics researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.
Such trials are costly and complex to design well for workplace settings, he explained, and federal financing for workplace safety studies is scarce.
“A lot of us are banging our heads against that wall now,” Dr.
Gerr said of the challenge of ascertaining which interventions work.
In the absence of definitive evidence, clinicians continue to exercise their best judgment in finding good solutions for their patients.
The New York Times launched The Local on a snowy day in March 2009, with hopes the blog would serve as a shining example of community collaboration amid the mushrooming online hyperlocal movement.
The Local was conceived not only as a place to get neighborhood news of the day, but as a blog by the people and for the people of Fort Greene and Clinton Hill.
As Andy Newman, The Times reporter who became an instant online and in-person presence in the neighborhood, put it, the paper envisioned The Local as a “petri dish” for experimenting with citizen engagement as journalism evolves.
What no one could have predicted was the way the blog – thanks to your enthusiastic participation for the last four years as readers, commenters, tipsters, writers, editors, crowdsourcing project participants, videographers and photographers – has become part of the fabric of the Fort Greene and Clinton Hill community.
These four years have brought great change, not only to our dynamic neighborhoods, but to The Local.
The CUNY Graduate School of Journalism, which worked with The Times and the community from the start of The Local, took over day-to-day operations of the site in January 2010, under the supervision of Times editors.
Now, more change is on the way.
The Times, having vastly contributed to, and gleaned lessons from, The Local, is moving on.
But the CUNY J-School plans to keep the site going and growing.
In making our fresh start, our name and location will change.
On Thursday May 16, The Local will become The Nabe, and it will be found at www.
We (and we mean WE, neighbors) will provide a vibrant online platform for the people of Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, using the emerging tools of journalism to tell and share stories in compelling new ways.
Besides the name change, we’re streamlining your viewing experience with a new, multimedia friendly look – perfect for your computer and most mobile devices.
We’re also adding a forum where locals can come together to talk.
More exciting features are in the works – all aimed at attracting additional community contributors and local voices into the site.
A spirit of collaboration drove The Local and now, we hope, will carry The Nabe to new heights.
So please use the comments section below to tell us what you would like to see on the revamped site.
And tell us how you would like to contribute.
In the meantime, locals, hope to see you soon, in The Nabe.
Nouriel Roubini, internationally acclaimed finance pop star, demands the introduction of a new discipline at the universities of the world, that of "criminal economics.
" Together with Roberto Saviano, the investigative journalist from Italy who has been a presumed target of Mafia godfathers for the past four years, he presented a lecture titled "Italy and the United States -- Two Perspectives on the Crisis" at New York University.
While Saviano pointed out the vulnerability of some U.
banks for money laundering and economic crime, and then established a connection to the financial crisis and the Italian Mafia, Roubini declared social inequality as the fundamental evil of the financial crisis and showed solidarity with the young protesters of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Security arrangements for Roberto Saviano's performance are thorough.
Saviano is an Italian national hero, and he knows it.
Two security guards follow him in a conspicuously inconspicuous manner while the reverent murmur preceding his entrance turns into surging applause.
The audience consists largely of Italians living in New York City.
Many left their home country because of a lack of opportunity or political exhaustion from 10 years of Silvio Berlusconi's questionable leadership.
This evening they have not come out to listen to economist Nouriel Roubini, rather they want to celebrate the charismatic Roberto Saviano.
"I am a complicated guest," Saviano says apologetically, "all the more I admire the courage of my hosts.
" The author, who has been in hiding since 2006 and never sees daylight without security guards seems relieved this night.
He smiles a lot although the international press describes him as having a great seriousness about him.
Considering his situation, that doesn't come as a real surprise.
The evening is a home game for a refugee who doesn't seem to fear the solitude that accompanies the fight for uncompromising truth.
Saviano focuses first on the machinations of financial institutions in the U.
and the money that is laundered every year.
Approximately 500 billion to one trillion dollars, profits from criminal activities like drug and human trafficking, are paid annually into various bank accounts around the world.
Experts estimate that half that amount reaches the United States.
Saviano is citing statistics from the DEA, the U.
Drug Enforcement Administration.
Since early December, a group of Republican Congressmen have been investigating the DEA, whose agents allegedly washed several million U.
dollars in an undercover investigation of Mexican drug cartels.
The investigators tried to find out what pathways the illegal profits were taking, though the Mexican government does not consider this method as useful.
"Citibank, Wachovia, Wells Fargo.
financial sinners with pleasure and finds himself in good company of U.
politicians and scientists, who also have been dealing with this topic extensively.
The linguist and activist Noam Chomsky, U.
Senator Carl Levin, and sociologist James Petras have already published stories regarding the involvement of some U.
banks in illegal financial transactions.
In 1998, the Supreme Court of the United States issued a critical report titled "Raul Salinas, Citibank, and Alleged Money Laundering" that questioned the procedures of Citibank.
The brother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas, Raul, had paid approximately 100 million U.
dollars, drug money, into Swiss bank accounts with a little help from his friends at Citibank.
Citibank had tried to obliterate the traces by using complex transactions and never verified the source of Salinas' assets.
"The willful blindness, and the ignorance of bank clerks and some authorities allow these illegal transactions to happen," Saviano adds while moving on to the next scandal, which he calls a "terrorist attack on the international financial system.
" Wachovia, which had merged with Wells Fargo in 2008, was according to U.
federal prosecutors, involved in the laundering of Mexican drug cartel money, to the amount of approximately 379 billion U.
"The scandal only broke because one person in the system carried out their duty and reported it," says Saviano, citing Attorney Jeffrey Sloman, "Wachovia's blatant disregard for our banking laws has issued international cocaine cartels a blank check to fund their illegal actions.
" These types of financial cartels often operate with the support of authorities who contribute to the impairment of the global financial system, according to Saviano.
Its credibility is affected from negatively, to an extremely high degree, while the peoples' trust in their governments and financial institutions is weakened.
Saviano is naming large American banks and the Camorra mafia clans, Cosa Nostra, 'Ndrangheta, and Sacra Corona Unita in the same breath just to clarify that there are no qualitative differences in breaking the law.
"At the same time, an organization such as Camorra is benefitting immensely from the financial crisis.
The mafia helps small businesses in nee, if the banks do not grant more loans.
The money will be paid even if there is little chance of compensation, because in the long run the company belongs to organized crime.
" In 2008, the Italian employers' association, Confesercenti, published the report SOS Impresa (SOS Company) and explained that about 180,000 Italian traders owe their godfathers and are paying more than 12 million euros in interest annually.
The Mafia also has access to enough cash to buy up property and companies in need at bargain prices.
"If they ever should be running out of cash, they kill each other," says Saviano.
A lack of cash flow doesn't seem to be a pressing issue for the Italian Mafia lately, since the combined turnover of all Italian "families" amounted to about 110 billion U.
dollars in 2008, turning the Mafia into Italy's most flourishing business enterprise.
looks similar: The FBI brought a total of 127 mobsters from New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island into custody in January of this year.
Greg Smith, author of Nothing but Money -- How the Mob Infiltrated Wall Street, explained in an interview, "Mafiosi always find new ways to earn money no matter what state the economy is in.
After the real estate market had collapsed in the U.
, they simply shifted their business from the corruption in the construction industry to mortgage fraud.
" The Roubini-Saviano panel was not a night of stringent, economic analysis, but very trenchantly Saviano, the brave, provided an overview of criminal activities by "legitimate" financial institutions, who in many instances share the same ignorance towards the law as organized crime.
Many contend that if a financial institution needs to borrow some money on a short-term basis from the government, but the institution is otherwise solvent, that lending is not a bailout.

In the week where the National Portrait Gallery removed a video of David Wojnarowicz from its sprawling show on gender identity, and prompted a firestorm over artistic freedom and taste, the museum can take comfort in one good statistic.
Last Saturday the web version of "Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture," featuring work from John Singer Sargent to Georgia O'Keefe and Jasper Johns, received only 328 visits.
On one kiosk in the physical show a brief view of a crucifix covered with ants by Wojnarowicz was called sacrilegious by Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, and others, and the Portrait Gallery decided it was too much of a distraction to the overall themes of the show.
As reports of the removal circulated, the online traffic soared.
By Monday night the online exhibition had received 8,301 visits.
Who was it who said "there's no such thing as bad publicity.

PARIS, FRANCE - SEPTEMBER 19: In this photo illustration the Netflix logo is seen on September 19, 2014 in Paris, France.
Netflix September 15 launched service in France, the first of six European countries planned in the coming months.
(Photo by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images) | Consumerist Our readers have confirmed: they are, indeed, waiting for-freaking-ever to get some discs from Netflix.
These include classic films, animated movies, television series, and new DVD releases.
Is there some kind of nationwide DVD shortage, or is Netflix trying to strangle its DVD business.
The logic to the long waits may have something to do with which distribution center is the closest to each reader.
Of course, we did contact Netflix to find out whether they had anything to say about the apparent shortages, and they didn’t respond to us.
Not that we expected them to: either they aren’t good at keeping their distribution centers stocked with discs, or they are deliberately trying to kill off the DVD portion of their business.
They wouldn’t want to admit to either of those, we’re sure.
Some readers reported seeing that all titles in their DVD queues said “Very Long Wait,” but that this was a glitch in the system that Netflix admitted to, and it resolved itself.
Eric sent along this screen grab from the middle of his queue, pointing out that most of the titles that he’s waiting for are “a mix of classics and second- or third-rate movies that people can’t be clamoring for that much.
” Most of them aren’t in demand, but aren’t out of print, either.
“Every time we call Netflix they are VERY kind and polite, but seem to just blow the proverbial hot air up the rear chute,” writes MZ, who sent along this screen shot of his own queue.
“Guess we will soon have to go back to the video store if Netflix doesn’t correct the problem,” MZ added.
If you even have access to a video store: in my town, there’s Redbox and the public library.
Philippe told us that he can’t figure out the logic to which discs there are shortages of, and which there aren’t.
“We had the urge to watch Friends again, and it’s rather random what is ‘Very long wait': Season 2 Disc 1, Season 3 Disc 3, Season 4 Disc 4, but none of the other ones in between.
” It’s possible that those discs contain very famous episodes, and people only want to watch those.
Or they’re particularly boring and other Netflix subscribers take a long time to finish watching and send them back.
Reader Laura reported a similar experience with some even older TV shows.
“My husband was expecting discs of TV shows ‘The Dukes of Hazzard’ (try not to judge) and ‘Taxi’.
Instead he’s getting ‘The Shining’ and some other random movie due to a ‘very long wait’ for 30-year old TV shows.
” Shabadoo reports that these two films at the top of his queue have been there for two years.
At this point, he’s not even all that interested in seeing them, but keeps them “as an experiment just to see what’ll happen.
” One interesting pattern that we noticed is that many Disney films feature very long waits.
We received multiple complaints from children of the ’90s who want to show their own children “Aladdin,” but the DVD is out of print.
Apparently Netflix’s few copies were very in demand.
(These complaints arrived during the week before Robin Williams, star of that movie, died on August 11th: the disc may be in demand even more now.
) How long have people been waiting.
On August 10, Kevin reported that he’s been waiting in line to see “Aladdin” for two years.
“Whether Netflix is doing this intentionally to kill off its DVD business or they’re just grossly incompetent, I do not know,” mused Eric, whose queue of movies that people aren’t “clamoring over” we shared above.
“Not sure which would be worse, actually.
” If you’re a fan of watching DVDs and content that won’t be licensed for streaming any time soon, the worse scenario would be that Netflix is killing off their classic disc-by-mail service intentionally.
Mismanagement can be fixed with a DVD-buying spree; but if Netflix wants to end the service, that’s what they’re going to do.
Which is a shame, if you like classic films, obscure documentaries, or foreign films.
Readers report lengthy delays for everything from Jack Lemmon comedies to recently-released Bollywood films.
“The Netflix DVD archives, in its heyday, was the largest single collection of movies that any average consumer has ever had access to in the history of human civilization,” reader James pointed out in an e-mail.
It’s true: it would be difficult for any one Blockbuster store to keep that kind of variety on hand.
Of course, there is also a way that you can turn this problem to your advantage, if you’re not a voracious DVD-watcher.
Reader Dave reports that he is able to use the discs with lengthy waits to his advantage, and sometimes take two discs at a time out, instead of the one disc that he pays for.
He explains: I actually use the waiting lengths to my advantage.
I have the bare bones 1 DVD at a time plan and have discovered that by rearranging the queue, I can get an extra DVD out of them.
I place the “very long wait” DVDs are at top, the “short wait” items below that, and then all available items.
Netflix will often apologize for the delay and send a second disc from the available list to assuage what they assume is my broken heart.
At one poin last month, I had two DVDs at home, one being returned to Netflix, and one being shipped.
Not bad for a 1 at a time plan.
At least one person is benefiting from these delays, even a little bit.

- Three-time NASCAR champion Tony Stewart will not face charges in the on-track death of sprint car driver Kevin Ward Jr.
Ontario County District Attorney Michael Tantillo announced Wednesday that a grand jury decided not to indict Stewart.
9 when a car driven by Stewart struck and killed him during a dirt track race at Canandaigua Motorsports Park in upstate New York.
The 20-year-old Ward, who had climbed from his car to confront Stewart, died of blunt force trauma.
Tantillo also said Wednesday that toxicology tests performed on Ward determined that he was under the influence of marijuana at the time of the fatal crash and that the levels of marijuana in his system were high enough to "impair judgment.
" According to Tantillo, there was no toxicology report run on Stewart, but a "drug recognition expert" interviewed him on the night of the crash and determined he was not on any drugs.
The district attorney looked at the evidence and could have brought charges or dropped the case himself, but said last week he was taking the matter to a grand jury that was convened this week.
Approximately two dozen witnesses testified in front of the grand jury, including a number of race car drivers, racetrack employees and volunteers, two accident reconstruction experts, medical personnel and a number of police officers.
The grand jury also reviewed photographs and video recordings, as well as other evidence, according to the district attorney's office.
In New York, only 12 of the 23 grand jury members needed to agree that charges were warranted.
The exact vote count in the Stewart case is not being released.
Stewart released a statement Wednesday following the announcement that the grand jury declined to indict him, saying, "This has been the toughest and most emotional experience of my life, and it will stay with me forever.
" It continued: "While much of this attention has been on me, it's important to remember a young man lost his life.
" Experts said Stewart could have been charged with second-degree manslaughter under New York law if prosecutors believed that he "recklessly caused the death of another person," with negligent homicide another possibility.
Authorities said the first car to pass Ward had to swerve to miss hitting him.
The front of Stewart's car appeared to clear Ward, but Ward was struck by the right rear tire and hurtled through the air.
His father later told a newspaper there was "no reason" for the death given Stewart's skills and experience.
Following Ward's death, Stewart skipped three races before returning late in the Sprint Cup's regular season.
After Ward's death, NASCAR announced a rule that prohibits drivers from climbing out of a crashed or disabled vehicle - unless it is on fire - until safety personnel arrive.
NASCAR released a statement Wednesday saying the organization's thoughts and prayers were with the Ward family and Stewart "as they all cope with this tragic incident" and "there are no winners in tragedy.
As the debate rages over Adrian Peterson’s child abuse charges, his defenders, including Charles Barkley, have suggested that this particular kind of discipline — lashing a child with a switch — is “cultural” and therefore beyond reproach.
When I was a child in the 1970s, my siblings and I were raised largely by my grandmother, after my father died and my mother had to find work.
My grandmother was an Italian immigrant, and her approach to disciplining children was thoroughly of the old school.
When one of us was misbehaving, she would grab whatever was handy — a wooden spoon, her cane, or most memorably, the hard plastic track from a Hot Wheels race car set — and smack us with it, hard enough to leave welts.
I was reminded of this as I began following the Peterson case.
Just as Peterson surely loves his children, my grandmother loved us, and was doing her best to teach us right from wrong.
She and everyone she knew had been disciplined that way as children.
As far as she knew, that was how children learned.
But as much as I owe my grandmother, I know she was wrong about that.
What we know now is that violence is the worst way to teach your children how to behave.
Violence is just an outlet for anger.
When used on children, it does great harm.
Research has found that physical punishment is linked to aggression, hyperactivity and emotional problems.
Worse, it teaches children that violence is O.
When children who were raised that way (like my grandmother and Peterson) grow up, they often use violence themselves in the way that they have learned.
As a society, we still look the other way.
We’re comfortable intervening when we see a woman being struck in public by her husband, but not when a child is struck by a parent.
But it is critical that we speak for these children, because they can’t speak for themselves.
We have a huge body of research on parenting available to us today, with a wealth of proven techniques and approaches.
We know the best ways to teach children self-reliance, self-control and good decision-making, skills that will serve them well their whole life.
And yet child-raising today is still considered a private issue, no one’s business but your own.
As parents, instead of treating parenting as a skill to be learned like any other and talking openly about it, we copy the patterns we learned growing up, and keep problems to ourselves.
The right and wrong ways to discipline our children should be just as widely understood as any other part of parenting, such as immunizations, or breast-feeding, or nutrition information.
We need to make positive parenting techniques and education about child development a standard part of the ways we help new parents.
And we need to make violent discipline unacceptable.
Just as we want our children to get the best education, we want them to grow up undamaged and confident.
We want to teach them to behave, to be good people and to have the self-discipline to go after their dreams.
We can start by separating our cultural values from our shameful habits and call violent discipline what it is: abuse.
Peterson says the childhood whippings and public humiliation he received from his father made him who he is today.
In truth, what he learned from his father threatens to derail his entire career, his reputation and his relationship with his children.
Peterson shouldn’t sell himself short.
He is where he is today in spite of his father, not because of him.
You don’t get to the National Football League without some extraordinary personal gifts, incredible determination and drive.
But he is still a part of a violent cycle.
Every day in our work, we see parents who were abused as children.
They come from dozens of cultural backgrounds, but they all want the same thing: They want better for their children than they had growing up.
They want to learn the skills they need to raise their children with clear expectations and good communication, not intimidation and brute force.
They’re learning what Peterson needs to learn now — that the best thing he can do, to use the old expression, is to get above his raising.
Someone who can leave his past behind and stop the cycle.
Wedding dresses cost a pretty penny -- unless you do what one bride did and make your own gown for less than the cost of a tank of gas.
Redditor alkikat posted pictures on Monday of the wedding dress she crocheted for herself during her morning bus commute (talk about multi-tasking).
If you think crocheting a dress would result in something only your grandmother would wear, think again.
Here's the final result: According to the bride, the total cost for the dress was $30, which included the cotton thread and fabric for the lining.
She even posted a time lapse video of her project -- which took a total of five months -- so you can see how the dress came together.
If there's a DIY-Bride-Of-The-Year award, consider it won.

Thanks to rising seas brought on by global warming, New Yorkers can count on a very wet, deadly, and expensive future.
Based on projections from the National Weather Service and the U.
Army Corps of Engineers, if a storm equivalent in strength to Hurricane Sandy were to hit the five boroughs in the year 2100, vastly larger swaths of the city would be submerged.
Sea levels are forecast to rise by as much as six feet before the end of the century, making low lying cities like New York all but defenseless to the wrath of powerful storms.
Unfortunately, over the past decade, scientific projections on sea level rise have grown rapidly as more data on climate change has continued to be analyzed.
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimate that by 2100 sea level would rise by a maximum of 23 inches.
In a draft of this year’s report, the final version of which is to be released this fall, the IPCC revised that outlook to a maximum of six feet.
“In the last several years we’ve observed accelerated melting of the ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica,” Radley Horton, a research scientist at Columbia University’s Earth Institute in New York City, told National Geographic in its September issue.
“The concern is that if the acceleration continues, by the time we get to the end of the 21st century, we could see sea-level rise of as much as six feet globally instead of two to three feet.
” Mayor Michael Bloomberg has proposed that the city spend $19.
5 billion to mount a defense against rising seas, roughly the same amount New York faced in losses as a result of Hurricane Sandy (43 people died in the city because of the storm).
Whether the mayor’s plan will be embraced before he leaves office, or will be championed by his successor, remains to be seen.
“Eventually the city will have to face up to this, because the problem is going to get worse,” Malcolm Bowman, a physical oceanographer at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, told National Geographic.
“It might take five years of study and another ten years to get the political will to do it.
By then there might have been another disaster.
We need to start planning immediately.
Otherwise we’re mortgaging the future and leaving the next generation to cope as best it can.
” In the absence of bold new measures, including the construction of massive storm surge barriers, the financial toll the city faces from rising sea levels in the not too distant future is more than a little daunting.
A new study by Nature Climate Change estimates that New York City faces about $2 billion in annual losses from flooding in 2050.

How this for weird timing: just as a $1-billion restoration for the LA River looms on the horizon and LA's Olympic dreams rely heavily the body of water as an event site, two city bureaus are hatching a plan that would "substantially" lower water levels in the river by 2022, says the Daily News.
Turns out, the water that flows through the mostly-concrete channel comes from a treatment plant in Van Nuys, where it's turned from yucky sewage into, well, river water.
(Up to 90 percent of the water in some parts of the river comes from this plant.
) But this new, river-parching proposal would see that treated water goes through purification (making it theoretically drinkable) so it can be pumped into the ground, and then someday be pumped back up, into taps and our mouths.
Doing so would create more drinking water for our thirsty city (yay.
) but less opportunities for awesome water-fun (boo.
7 Things I Wish I Knew Before Coming Out as Gay Coming out was the best thing I've ever done for myself.
That being said, coming out came with its fair share of struggles that I felt I had to navigate alone.
To all the gay men who have just come out or are in the process of coming out, I hope this list helps make your experience a little easier.

Many of us have been bending our characters' genders and sexual orientations for years, but it's terrific to see the game officially embrace this.
If we don't address these intersecting identities and the fact that sexism, racism, classism and the like are within our rainbow bubble, we are hurting the very members of our community that we proclaim we are fighting to protect.

Here’s how they stack up against each other.
A pair of Australian architects believe they have designed a storm-resistant home of the future in Breezy Point.
The so-called “Bayside Bunker,” a prefab, solar-powered home with debris-proof windows by designers Rayne Fouche and Larissa Searle, bested 19 other submissions to win The Urban Green Council’s R3Build competition Wednesday night.
“We could, in many ways, relate to the geographic character of Breezy Point and the extreme weather conditions,” said Fouche, who with Searle graduated from the University of Queensland.
“Living on the east coast of Australia, we have seen extreme floods and coastal erosions, which have destroyed homes and swallowed front yards.
” Designers were asked to envision homes that would fit in the Hurricane Sandy-battered Rockaway neighborhood, where hundreds of structures were destroyed by fire and flood waters.
Urban Green Council Executive Director Russell Unger said applicants were asked to create energy-efficient one-family homes that could meet the unique needs of the community.
“Everyone is desperate to get back into their homes,” said Unger, who said another prerequisite for designers was that building costs could not exceed $150,000.
“But what you might have done 50 years ago isn’t going to work anymore.
” New York City-based architects and designers took second and third place awards with homes that protected against the elements with a combination of trellises and decks.
Applicants used the property of long-time Breezy Point resident Matilda Curley as a template.
The home was destroyed by the storm.
Curley, the 95-year-old family matriach, passed away earlier this year.
Her relatives have pledged to consider using some of the winning designs when rebuilding her home.
The entire debate is on NY1 and apparently no password is needed to see it.
At 24 seconds into the 2nd segment: Chrissy: As we all know, Jobs For New York has endorsed you and your campaign.
And they also have spent over $100K to falsely attack your opponents.
Now, you and I have always talked, and you have stated publicly that you were against negative campaigning, and it's something that you would not condone.
However, your spokesperson has said that you were happy and willing to accept help from anyone that was willing to give it to you.
So, my question is why have you never publicly denounced the attacks, and why did you not ask Jobs For New York to stop the negative attacks on your behalf because you do not condone them.
Vallone: Well one of the things that Chrissy and I agree on is running a positive campaign is paramount and is something that's respected and needed in our district.
And one of our important messages is always to say is outside expenditures should be banned across the board.
Not just any one organization - all of them.
Local races should remain local.
What are you responsible for these days.
The campaign you lead and the positive message you send out.
In 2009, my first campaign, and again now in 2013, our message has never been about the other candidates - publicly at debates, publicly here, you never go after candidates.
It's not what the people deserve.
So my campaign is a positive message, and any outside groups should be banned from being involved in any of our local races, period.
[Basically, he refused to denounce Jobs For New York.
] Graziano: Since you haven't denounced what Jobs For New York has done, I'm going to take a different approach, which is that you talk about community and unity as part of the main thrust of your campaign, how does that reconcile with the votes you have done at Community Board 7 - for example, when you backed Gambino crime family associates for the White House to build construction against the wishes of the community in Whitestone and the neighbors.
Vallone: It's interesting when you can speak for Community Board 7 when you don't sit on Community Board 7.
Community Board 7 overwhelmingly approved the project that Mr.
It was a manufacturing block and it was a project that everyone who was there approved.
Graziano's demeanor is to come in at the last minute and cause strife.
So unlike campaigns that try to segregate the community, we unite the community.
And that's what leadership should do.
You should talk to the community board, talk to the elected officials, not stand on the corner screaming about a story that no one wants to listen to.
So if that's the approach that certain campaigns want to take, then let them take that.
We are proud to work together with the community board, because we have 2 in our district - Community Board 7 and Community Board 11 and those are the areas that take control for the zoning, the elected official.
For someone to say that they are single-handedly responsible for that, speaks volumes about that person.
[Graziano never said he spoke for Community Board 7, he said that the community of Whitestone was against the White House rezoning, which is proven by the above link.
Paul Vallone dodged the question, but apparently got his issue confused with the Waterpointe rezoning (a contaminated Whitestone site) that his family's lobbying firm pushed for, because the White House area is not the least bit industrial.
] Duane: As you know, I have pledged that I will be a full-time council member.
Would you pledge to give up your law practice and be a full-time council member as well.
Vallone: I will absolutely, if honored by the people of the district, be a full-time council member.
That's what my brother was and if I have that honor to represent the district, that's what I will do.
I think that's critical, and I think that's one of the things John has pointed out over the campaign, and has Austin, to make sure 100% commitment to the City Council.
That's what the people deserve in our district and that's what I pledge.
[Interesting, considering that at every debate, he refused to say he would be a full-time council member.
Also interesting is that his brother, Peter, is featured as a member of the Vallone law practice, proving that he's not actually a full-time council member.
] Shafran: Overdevelopment from the real estate industry is one of the biggest threats to our neighborhood.
Now Paul, you are a registered lobbyist for a firm that received $2.
5M last year selling access to city government, for, among others, the real estate industry.
You've received approximately $85K in contributions throughout your runs for the city council from the real estate industry, and as Chrissy pointed out, the biggest NYC developers have created a superPAC that spent over $250K on you and your campaign.
Now we have a public finance campaign system that was put in place and which we are all a part of, that is supposed to root out the influence of special interest spending and you've taken $95K in public matching funds from that system.
So my question for you is, on behalf of the taxpayers of our community, can we have our money back.
Vallone: Well, all of the money the candidates receive are governed by the NYC Campaign Finance Board.
And all of us have received the matching funds.
And every one of our contributions I'm very proud of.
When you spend a lifetime in the community, such as I have, you have a family in the community, small business in the community, you make a lot of friends in the community.
And those are the connections and those are the people that are working with our campaign.
So any type of receipt for any type of contribution to our campaign has been public.
And any idea that that is somehow being kept from the people of the district is insane.
In fact, what does our practice do.
We're a small practice - a law firm that was started by my grandfather 80 years ago.
And we do elder law and we do work in the community.
That's what our community does.
[So Paul Vallone, of the Astoria Vallones, wants us to think that he is a lifelong resident of northeastern Queens.
There's nothing he won't lie about, is there.
] Shafran: Actually, I'm talking about the firm with which you are a registered lobbyist that made $2.
5M last year selling access to city government.
Vallone: When you are a lawyer and you provide legal services, and if a client comes to you and they also need consulting services, you must register with the City of New York.
Shafran: So you are a registered lobbyist.
Vallone: My father is one of the most distinguished members of the city, and he has a consulting firm.
If a client comes to us and they need legal services, and they also need consulting services, by law, you must register as a lobbyist.
That is what the law requires and - going back to John's question - the minute that this district is honored and privileged to vote me into City Hall, all of that will end because our job will be 100% for City Council.
Someone thinks rather highly of himself and his family.
] Shafran: So, I do take that to mean that you are a registered lobbyist and we all know that.
This campaign has been hijacked by outside spending.
[Then it becomes a free-for-all.
] At 8:24 in the second segment, Errol Louis steps in: Louis: If the questions you've heard so far have not been clear, let me try to focus them for you.
They're saying, and we have seen, there's a lot of money that has been spent by this group, Jobs For New York.
They don't talk about jobs, they don't even talk about New York.
They have made personal attacks on all of your opponents.
You've said earlier tonight that you don't like that sort of a theme, they would like you to say publicly that you would like them to stop doing it in the last week.
Shafran: Which other candidates have done throughout the city.
Vallone: I started the night off by saying across the board - no outside expenditures from any group.
I'm taking it beyond one group to all the groups.
And if that's an answer the candidates don't like, they're just going to have to live with it.
RED HOOK — The Brooklyn developer and concrete tycoon who hopes to expand his Red Hook shipping terminal with toxic landfill owes the state tens of thousands of dollars in fines for illegally dumping into Gowanus Bay.
Records show the amount John Quadrozzi is on the hook for could be as much as $20 million.
Quadrozzi, the owner of Gowanus Bay Terminal and the 46-acre Gowanus Industrial Park in Red Hook, left a large pile of potentially contaminated fill on a broken pier near the bay in May 2006, according to court documents provided by the state's Department of Environmental Conservation.
The fill, comprised of dirt and other unknown materials, washed into the water during high tide shortly afterward.
The pollution "compromised the ecology of the shoreline," the DEC said in an email to DNAinfo.
"Since the origin and composition of the material is unknown, it is…possible (not certain) that the material contained chemical constituents that would…not be acceptable in tidal waters," a DEC attorney wrote.
"The environmental consequences may have included.
the clouding of waterways and interfering with the habitat of living things that depend on those waters.
" The DEC ordered Gowanus Industrial Park to pay the state $60,000 in civil penalties in May 2007, an amount that was to be submitted in 10 monthly installments through 2008.
The company has yet to pay $45,000 of that original fine.
The DEC also directed GIP to remove an 18-foot-tall, 200-foot-long corrugated metal fence it had installed without permission between Henry Street Basin and the Red Hook Recreation Area, which effectively walled-off the area's waterfront views.
Quadrozzi and his company ultimately fought both orders and submitted only the first three payments totaling $15,000, according to the DEC.
They also left the fence in place for more than a year, contending that it kept trespassers out of the terminal and "promote[d] the health of the people of the State of New York by preventing a spreading of dust" — a claim the DEC labeled "a stretch at best," according to court documents.
Quadrozzi and GIP eventually removed the fence in 2009, but only after an appeals court found their contentions against removing the fence "without merit.
" The fines could multiply hundreds of times over.
In 2008, the DEC filed suit seeking $10,500 for each day the remainder of the outstanding $60,000 fine has not been paid since May 23, 2007, plus an additional $10,000.
To date, that amounts to nearly $20 million.
The fines, however, have not stopped Quadrozzi from seeking to expand the Gowanus Bay Terminal, located in Gowanus Industrial Park.
Earlier this year, he proposed that the Environmental Protection Agency take toxic sludge it plans to dredge from the Gowanus Canal Superfund site, ship it by barge to his terminal, convert it to landfill with a "concrete-like stabilizing substance," then allow him to dump it into the Gowanus Bay, the EPA and Quadrozzi's consultant, Phaedra Thomas, said in an interview last month.
Quadrozzi would use the fill to expand the terminal's pier, allowing it to berth larger, oceangoing ships, Thomas explained.
He would also create more land above the water, which he could then rent to industrial tenants.
Both developments would provide as many as 200 jobs to local residents, Thomas said.
The EPA confirmed last month that it is seriously considering the plan — one of many it said it is examining.
The agency has not said whether or how Quadrozzi's prior environmental violations would affect its view of his proposal.
But, if approved, the plan could allow Quadrozzi to overcome local and state statutes that largely prohibit private landowners from reshaping New York City's shoreline, and make him the first person to do so since the 1700s.
The environmental concerns, however, are substantial, experts said — not only because of potential water pollution, but also because of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Sandy.
The superstorm severely flooded low-lying areas of New York City, notably Red Hook which is largely comprised of landfill.
"I don't think that they could just willy-nilly push out into the harbor like that, because then you're making less room for the water, and it has to go somewhere else," said Robert Chant, an assistant professor of physical oceanography at Rutgers University.
"These kinds of things, one thing could affect another in ways that aren't completely obvious initially.
" Thomas Angotti, a professor of urban planning and policy development at Hunter College, said he agreed.
"So much of the problem we are facing now is due to excessive landfilling and contamination of the waterways.
One of the key tasks we face is restoration of the ecosystem and redesign of the waterfront to protect both human and natural habitats," he wrote in an email.
"Our port facilities need to be protected and expanded, but not at the expense of environmental justice.
" Quadrozzi said he was unaware of the fines.

The introduction alone contains one of the best epigrams I've read in years: "Money drives the Mercedes called Manhattan.
Individuality and eccentricity takes the bus.
" From there, the book takes wing with some of the most extraordinary tales in modern memory.
There are (far too) many books out there already on the subject of the Chelsea's heyday and sad demise.
They don't come close to covering the ground and garnering the true sense of what it must have be like in its prime.

12 of 13 people found the following review helpful (San Francisco, CA United States) - See all my reviews This review is from: This Ain't No Holiday Inn: Down and Out at the Chelsea Hotel 1980�1995 (Paperback) I met author James Lough on the rooftop garden of the old San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, introduced by a mutual friend.
Perhaps he knew of my interest in the 80s (about which I have often written) for he told me that he'd be soon publishing a book on the Chelsea Hotel during that period.
Not exactly the glory days for the hotel, but I told him I'd look out for his book and now that it is under my belt, I'd like to recommend it to those of my readers who can look a gritty subject in its face and not shrink away, for This Ain't No Holiday Inn is Bold with a capital B.
Quickly Lough sketches the bygone days when Thomas Wolfe and O.
Henry lived in the place, when Sarah Bernhardt built her own exotic pyramid in her apartment with which to restore her energies.
The sixties (Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Nico, Patti Smith, Leonard Cohen, Joplin) made the hotel a synonym for raffish sleaze, but by the time Sid killed Nancy it was all downhill.
Lough has assembled a team of talkative Chelsea habitues, I think all but one or two former residents of the hotel, to spill their most intimate stories.
I hadn't heard of any of the witnesses, so in terms of star power this is no EDIE or REDS, but each has his or her own charm and the stories that come tumbling out of them are like some lost Pasolini film like Mamma Roma or whatever, the drive, the lust for life, the passion for drugs, the rebellion and the ennui.
These witnesses describe the last days of beat legends Huncke and Corso; the birth of the love affair between Viva Superstar and William Eggleston; the conflicted post-Ramones musical career of Dee Dee Ramone, and the mess that was Jaco Pastorius, in his twenties one of the most talented bassists of jazz, in his thirties a corpse self-medicated to death.
Dee Dee Ramone is quoted as having said, "All you need for a good punk rock song is three chords and a grudge.
" Most of the action takes place on the hotel's second and third floors, where most of the lowlifes were housed, and we hear very little of the upper floors of the hotel, where wealthy aristocrats passed their days on oysters and ormolu furniture, little guessing about the human misery groveling below their parquet floors.
Yes, five or six stories below men and women were turning tricks for one hit of crack cocaine, and that was on a good day.
Last Exit to Brooklyn move over, This Ain't No Holiday Inn is the new benchmark in squalor and broken minds.
I take 1980-1995 as the era during which AIDS ravaged New York City and the world, and the Chelsea, of course, was not spared.
Some affecting AIDS stories give the book its depth, its compassion, its courage.
Lough can write (his analysis of Eggleston's photos is astute and provocative) and he seems to enjoy the perfect confidence of these blind creatures of the night.
) Witnesses describe the painter and poet Rene Ricard as autocratic and sometimes withering (he appears in a sub-chapter titled, "Scary Poet Rene Ricard") but is given his proper due as a Leonardo-like Renaissance man--one guy tells Lough that "if you're an intellectual, Rene Ricard is a blast.
It's like sitting with someone like Shelley or Milton.
" And he refers not to Shelley Winters or Milton Berle; he means to place Ricard in the very Pantheon of human genius, so yeah.
It is too bad they couldn't afford a proofreader down there, so that Virgil Thomson's name appears as Thomson some of the time, as "Thompson" the rest of the time--Thomson and Thompson, like the twin detectives in the Tintin books.
After hearing himself referred to as "Brooks" he may not make it to 89.
Nevertheless anybody who's ever had a cockroach crawl over their shoe will warm to this book as I did.
6 of 6 people found the following review helpful (Savannah, GA) - See all my reviews This review is from: This Ain't No Holiday Inn: Down and Out at the Chelsea Hotel 1980�1995 (Paperback) I know very little about the Chelsea Hotel in New York City, so "This Ain't No Holiday Inn" was a fascinating and insightful read.
James Lough uses a creative approach to tell the history of the "glory years" of the hotel by using the direct quotes of some of the hotels former-residents.
Their stories are linked together in a conversational approach--I felt like I was sitting in the hotel listening to their conversations.
The descriptions are vivid and the tales are clever and interesting.
Lough doesn't regurgitate facts like a history book--he tells a story in a humorous and engaging style that makes the book move forward quickly without getting bogged down in tedious side stories or unrelated, hyped-up facts.
He's also quick to show that there was never just "one story" to be told.
All the residents interviewed for the book offer their own quirky takes on their fellow residents and "what really happened.
" With stories about Jimi Hendrix, Dee Dee Ramone, Bob Dylan, Andy Warhol, the beat writers, punk musicians, artists, poets, actors and other colorful characters we never knew existed, "This Ain't No Holiday Inn" is a treasure of unusual and colorful stories about a hotel that used to be flocked in bohemian culture.
The book is a rare glimpse at an institution that no longer exists--an institution that rarely speaks.
Lough looks into popular tales like Sid and Nancy, but he also uncovers rare stories about Jimi Hendrix, beat writer Herbert Hunke, former Warhol actress Viva and the hotel's other mysterious guests and staff.
If you want to read something about the iconic Chelsea Hotel that you have never read before, then this is the book for you.
1 of 1 people found the following review helpful The Last of the Bohemians, (Savannah, GA) - See all my reviews This review is from: This Ain't No Holiday Inn: Down and Out at the Chelsea Hotel 1980�1995 (Paperback) In this oral history, author James Lough connects with former residents of New York City's infamous Chelsea Hotel and paints a compelling picture of the bohemian, punk, and sometimes deviant lifestyles for which the hotel was best known.
Told in the residents' own words and connected with Lough's concise commentary, this document is especially important now that the hotel's new ownership has turned it into luxury residences and expelled the last of a century's worth of notable figures in the arts, culture, and counter-culture.
The book reads quickly and enjoyably, covering movements as diverse as punk and beat as told by first-hand witnesses and participants.
While the information is interesting in itself, the real strength of the book lies in how it reveals each of the dozen-and-a-half interviewees as an individual.
These individual stories, more than the grand myths of the hotel, show the reader what life was like there, and why so many aspiring artists flocked to its halls.

Oh and throw in some artistic pretense for good measure.
As a dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker I thought I knew of most of the eccentric goings-on in this Bohemian oasis, but Lough has shed new light on the Chelsea - and in a beautifully written style that makes the book almost impossible to put down.

A New Boswell on the riotous life of a Bohemian Hotel in New York City, (Utah) - See all my reviews This review is from: This Ain't No Holiday Inn: Down and Out at the Chelsea Hotel 1980-1995 (Kindle Edition) Whereas the original James Boswell immortalized Samuel Johnson in his 18th century classic of English literature, Life of Johnson, another much more modern James, with the same skill of biographical prose and propensity for tale-bearing and eavesdropping, has given us a vivid portrait of the Chelsea Hotel and its outre denizens and residents in the 1980s and early 90s.
One can almost picture the author (in fact, he tells us as much), notepad and pen in hand, listening to the old walls and surviving tenants whispering to him about what all they had seen and heard over the years in that storied edifice of art and squalor on West 23rd Street.
It is not just James Lough's talent with the English language and very entertaining reporting of all this, but his almost gleeful indiscretion in doing so that makes This Ain't No Holiday Inn a must read and the Chelsea Hotel even more of a legend—just like Boswell accomplished for Samuel Johnson.

Lacking the schmaltzy over-sentimentality found in many obituaries of the hotel since its closing/renovation, Lough allows the hotel's residents to speak for themselves, only providing the topics of discussion; usually its most famous residents but also the hotel's day-to-day life.
With the 80s and early 90s as a backdrop, Lough is able to provide a complete history of the hotel's last hurrah, as well as its decline (as of August 2013, the hotel has been "under renovation" since 2011, according to its website).
And despite what you may think (or I did at the outset), the hotel wasn't in decline after the 50s and 60s Beats and hippies--the Chelsea's late period, "where art and criminality meet," features a confluence of icons, both old and new, from original Beat Herbert Huncke to Dee Dee Ramone.
The result, as told by their contemporaries, is at times hilarious and horrifying, but always compelling.
This "monstrous red-brick ecosystem of creativity" is unique in American history--an artist colony without any of the traditional trappings of one.
Its story is well known, but its late period has so far been unexplored.
Lough's treatment of that decade and a half are unique and effective.
He saves his cultural criticism for the book's introduction and epilogue, which are incredibly effective and thought-provoking.
While he has virtually infinite opportunities to comment on the zeitgeist represented by the Chelsea, he wisely saves it to bookend his oral history.
The residents featured in "This Ain't No Holiday Inn" speak for themselves and don't need deconstruction.
It's one thing to come up with a list of The Hotel Chelsea's famous residents and their tales (Dylan Thomas, Arthur Miller, Arthur C.
Clarke, Virgil Thomson, Herbet Huncke), but another to get firsthand stories of some its (in)famous late residents.
These stories, at once unbelievable, pulpy and amazing make "This Ain't No Holiday Inn" immensely readable and also an effective paen to a monument of American culture that can never be duplicated.
Travel back in time to a funkier, freakier New York, - See all my reviews This review is from: This Ain't No Holiday Inn: Down and Out at the Chelsea Hotel 1980�1995 (Paperback) This book is an oral history consisting of interviews with former hotel residents.
Most them are peripheral characters because many of the more famous residents died (early) and the book focuses on the 80s after the hotel has already begun declining.
However the book is still a fascinating window into a funkier, freakier New York City the way it was before it became a corporate Disneyland for the rich.
The hotel management encouraged artists of all kinds to live a the hotel.
If management felt like you had potential, they'd give you a break on rent.
With the artists came junkies, drag queens, prostitutes, and unclassifiable characters that gave the Chelsea such a strange atmosphere.
The book is divided into different character-centric chapters ie Dee Dee Romane, the management, etc.
Alongside the interviews are fascinating footnotes worthy of David Foster Wallace.
Ultimately the book is an elegy for a stranger, more artistic New York.
Artists and musicians are what give cities their flavor, if the rents are too high, then a city will become a duller and blander place without them.
If you're a reader interested in punk rock, beat writers, or New York history, I'd recommend this title.

Caldwell Jones, a beanpole of a center and power forward who blocked more than 2,200 shots in his 17-year pro career and played in three National Basketball Association finals with the Philadelphia 76ers, died on Sunday in Stockbridge, Ga.
His wife, Vanessa, confirmed the death.
She said he was at a driving range near their home when he had a heart attack.
Lithe and quick at 6 feet 11 and 217 pounds, Jones was best known as a rebounder and a shot blocker, but he had ball skills as well.
With a smooth, slithery move to the basket, a fluid hook shot and a reliable short-range jumper, he shot better than 47 percent for his career, and he was even asked on occasion to bring the ball upcourt.
Early in his career, he played three seasons for four teams in the old American Basketball Association and averaged almost 16 points per game, but when he joined the 76ers of the N.
in 1976, he was no longer depended on to score.
Over the next six seasons, he was a frontcourt defensive specialist playing alongside powerhouse offensive stars like Julius Erving, George McGinnis and Darryl Dawkins.
His size and speed gave him rare versatility on defense: Sometimes his duty was to guard a big man in the middle like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and sometimes it was to shadow a scorer in perpetual motion like Larry Bird.
As a Sixer, Jones was twice named to the all-N.
He was a crucial cog on a squad that reached the championship finals in 1977 — they lost in six games to a Portland Trail Blazers team led by Bill Walton — and in 1980 and 1982, losing six-game series both times to Abdul-Jabbar’s Los Angeles Lakers.
, where his parents, Caldwell Sr.
and Cecelia Jones, were cotton farmers.
They had a girl and seven boys, four of whom — Charles, Wilbert and Major, in addition to Caldwell — played in the N.
From 1969 to 1973, Jones attended Albany State College (now Albany State University) in Georgia, where he and his brothers commandeered a whole chapter of school basketball history.
Six of the Jones brothers played center for Albany State — from 1961 to 1979 one Jones or another was the big man in the middle — and Oliver Jones went on to become the head coach of the team for 28 years, retiring in 2000.
, playing for the San Diego Conquistadors (where his coach was Wilt Chamberlain), Caldwell Jones led the league in blocked shots.
The franchise subsequently went out of business, but before the two leagues merged in 1976, Jones also played for the San Diego Sails, the Kentucky Colonels and the Spirits of St.
, after six years with the 76ers, he was sent to the Houston Rockets, where his brother Major was a teammate.
He later played for the Chicago Bulls during Michael Jordan’s rookie year, spent four seasons with the Trail Blazers and retired in 1990 after a year with the San Antonio Spurs, helping to school their young center David Robinson in the ways of pro ball.
For his career, Jones scored more than 10,000 points, grabbed more than 10,000 rebounds and averaged 1.
8 blocks per game over nearly 1,300 games.
In 1992, Jones married Vanessa Dorton, a school administrator whom he had met in Portland.
In addition to her, he is survived by five brothers, Clint, Oliver, Charles, Wilbert and Major; and five daughters, Tanasha Polk and Jasmine, Zori, Maya and Leah Jones.
Jones was widely respected among players and sportswriters as a genial, thoughtful and witty presence off the court and a self-sacrificing one on it.
After the Sixers had lost for a second time in the championship finals to the Lakers, the team sent Jones and a first-round draft pick to Houston as compensation for their signing of the free-agent center Moses Malone.
It was bad luck for Jones: Malone led the team to a championship in 1983, sweeping the Lakers in the finals.
Months later, however, in recognition of Jones’s contribution to the team, the 76ers coach, Billy Cunningham, offered Jones his own championship ring.
“He epitomized a team player,” Cunningham said, after Jones’s death, to the Philadelphia sportswriter Gordie Jones (no relation) on the website CSNPhilly.
“If we won, he would have been the happiest guy in the locker room.
And that’s not just a statement, like you hear things, nice things, being said about somebody who is deceased.
If you were to guess the top ten most expensive neighborhoods in LA County, you could probably get half the names on this latest ZipRealty list correct.
But what's interesting about the list, which shows the county's priciest zip codes according to median sales price, is which neighborhoods are seeing a rise in year-over-year prices—sometimes as much as 55 percent.
—and which ones are seeing less-than average gains or even decreases.
Compare the median home price across the board in LA County, which went up 6 percent year-over-year to $459,000 at the close of June, with Santa Monica's 90402 zip code which had a median sales price in June 2014 of $3.
7 million, and also saw year-over-year gains of 15 percent.
That "Greater Wilshire" zip code 90004 covers, generally, Melrose south to Third Street between Highland Avenue and Hoover Street, making it a mixed bag that gets parts of Hancock Park, Koreatown, Windsor Square, and Larchmont all smushed in together.
That seems to be an winning combination, because their home price has seen a 55 percent increase.

Welcome back to Thinking Big, wherein journalist Bridget Moriarity (whose work has been published in Travel + Leisure, Art + Auction, and Time Out New York, among others) joins Curbed to explore large-scale trends and topics within the design and architecture community.
This past winter, the London-based architect David Chipperfield voiced his objections to the notion of "starchitecture" in an interview with Architectural Digest: "Often architects work too hard trying to make their buildings look different.
It's like we're actors let loose on a stage, all speaking our parts at the same time in our own private languages without an audience.
" Starchitecture has been a phenomenon ever since Frank Gehry built his spectacular Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in the late 1990s.
Gehry's building has become a cultural pilgrimage site in a small corner of northeastern Spain, bringing flocks of tourists to its sleepy Basque town.
The building, with its otherworldly angular titanium façade, is an example of starchitecture at its best.
"In terms of site planning, it is a very contextually savvy building, even if photographs make it look like something very unexpected," says Barry Bergdoll, formerly the Museum of Modern Art's chief curator of architecture and design.
Ironically, it's Gehry himself who's perhaps the strongest critic of the term "starchitect"; he railed against it in a 2010 Playboy interview and more recently in a Financial Times piece in which he asks arts writer Peter Aspden, "You are not going to call me a fucking 'star­chitect'.
America is mired in three wars.
The past decade was the hottest on record.
Unemployment remains stuck near 9 percent, and there’s a small, albeit real, possibility that the U.
government will default on its debt.
A reality-television star who can’t persuade anyone that his hair is real is alleging that the president of the United States was born in Kenya.
Perhaps this is just the logical endpoint of two years spent arguing over what Barack Obama is — or isn’t.
We’ve obsessed over every answer except the right one: President Obama, if you look closely at his positions, is a moderate Republican from the early 1990s.
And the Republican Party he’s facing has abandoned many of its best ideas in its effort to oppose him.
If you put aside the emergency measures required by the financial crisis, three major policy ideas have dominated American politics in recent years: a health-care plan that uses an individual mandate and tax subsidies to achieve near-universal coverage; a cap-and-trade plan that attempts to raise the prices of environmental pollutants to better account for their costs; and bringing tax rates up from their Bush-era lows as part of a bid to reduce the deficit.
In each case, the position that Obama and the Democrats have staked out is the very position that moderate Republicans staked out in the early ’90s — and often, well into the 2000s.
The individual mandate was developed by a group of conservative economists in the early ’90s.
Mark Pauly, an economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, was one of them.
“We were concerned about the specter of single-payer insurance,” he told me recently.
The conservative Heritage Foundation soon had an individual-mandate plan of its own, and when President Bill Clinton endorsed an employer mandate in his health-care proposal, both major Republican alternatives centered on an individual mandate.
By 1995, more than 20 Senate Republicans — including Chuck Grassley, Orrin Hatch, Dick Lugar and a few others still in office — had sponsored one individual mandate bill or another.
The story on cap and trade — which conservatives now like to call “cap and tax” — is much the same.
Back then, the concern was sulfur dioxide, the culprit behind acid rain.
Bush wanted a solution that relied on the market rather than on government regulation.
So in the Clean Air Act of 1990, he proposed a plan that would cap sulfur-dioxide emissions but let the market decide how to allocate the permits.
That was “more compatible with economic growth than using only the command and control approaches of the past,” he said.
The plan passed easily, with “aye” votes from Sen.
In fact, as recently as 2007, Gingrich said that “if you have mandatory carbon caps combined with a trading system, much like we did with sulfur.
it’s something I would strongly support.
” As for the 1990 budget deal, Bush initially resisted tax increases, but eventually realized they were necessary to get the job done.
“It is clear to me that both the size of the deficit problem and the need for a package that can be enacted require all of the following: entitlement and mandatory program reform, tax revenue increases, growth incentives, discretionary spending reductions, orderly reductions in defense expenditures, and budget process reform,” he said.
That deal, incidentally, was roughly half tax increases and half spending cuts.
Obama’s budget has far fewer tax increases.
And compared with what would happen if the Bush tax cuts were allowed to expire in 2012, it actually includes a large tax cut.
The normal reason a party abandons its policy ideas is that those ideas fail in practice.
These initiatives were wildly successful.
Mitt Romney passed an individual mandate in Massachusetts and drove its number of uninsured below 5 percent.
The Clean Air Act of 1990 solved the sulfur-dioxide problem.
The 1990 budget deal helped cut the deficit and set the stage for a remarkable run of growth.
Rather, it appears that as Democrats moved to the right to pick up Republican votes, Republicans moved to the right to oppose Democratic proposals.
As Gingrich’s quote suggests, cap and trade didn’t just have Republican support in the 1990s.
John McCain included a cap-and-trade plan in his 2008 platform.
The same goes for an individual mandate, which Grassley endorsed in June 2009 — mere months before he began calling the policy “unconstitutional.
” This White House has shown a strong preference for policies with demonstrated Republican support, but that’s been obscured by the Republican Party adopting a stance of unified, and occasionally hysterical, opposition (remember “death panels”.
) — not to mention a flood of paranoia about the president’s “true” agenda and background.
But as entertaining as the reality-TV version of politics might be, it can’t be permitted to, ahem, trump reality itself.
If you want to obsess over origins in American politics, look at the president’s policies, not his birth certificate.
Angus Li, a 19-year-old sociology major at Hong Kong Baptist University, does more than take part in student demonstrations: He accessorizes for them.
Li was on the hilltop quad of Chinese University of Hong Kong on Monday with thousands of students from local universities, kicking off a weeklong student class boycott.
At his side was a tote bag emblazoned with the face of the quintessential revolutionary, Ernesto “Che” Guevara, the Argentine Marxist.
Li’s white T-shirt, in black Chinese characters, the sentence, “When dictatorship becomes a fact, revolution becomes a duty.
” That was a key slogan of the student-led “Sunflower Movement” in Taiwan earlier this year.
Demonstrators in Taipei, protesting against a trade pact with China that they feared would further enmesh the island with the Communist mainland, hung the quote, similar to one penned by the French author Victor Hugo, in huge characters on Taiwan’s Parliament building, which they were occupying in a protest.
Students in Hong Kong are gearing up for their own civil disobedience, with plans to stage sit-in protests in the city’s Central business district in coming days and weeks, though these may take place on a holiday, causing minimal disruption.
And like their Taiwanese counterparts, fear of the increasing influence of Beijing drives the Occupy Central movement, which is pushing for public nominations for candidates for Hong Kong’s highest office.
Hong Kong’s student rebels, highly educated and living in one of the world’s most affluent and open cities, are drawing inspiration from student movements across the planet.
Other students passed out glossy programs for the event — much like the kind found at baseball games or Broadway shows — that included a spread about the 1968 student demonstrations in France.
And Hugo’s “Les Misérables” also plays into the Occupy Central movement.
The movement’s theme song — “Do You Hear the People Sing.
” — is from the musical adaptation of Hugo’s classic novel and is sung in Cantonese by a little girl.
Li, sporting Wayfarer sunglasses, outlined his own plans for the protests.
“What I expect here is to make some noise for some actions afterward, like Occupy Central,” he said.
Li take part in Occupy Central, risking arrest.
“I am not sure whether I’ll be sitting down there,” Mr.
” “There are some contradictions in my mind,” he said, adding that he is feeling pressure from his family.
His father told him not to make a “mess.
When the antidrug educator Tim Ryan talks to students, he often asks them what they know about marijuana.
“It’s a plant,” is a common response.
But more recently, the answer has changed.
Now they reply, “It’s legal in Colorado.
” These are confusing times for middle and high school students, who for most of their young lives have been lectured about the perils of substance abuse, particularly marijuana.
Now it seems that the adults in their lives have done an about-face.
Recreational marijuana is legal in Colorado and in Washington, and many other states have approved it for medical use.
Lawmakers, the news media and even parents are debating the merits of full-scale legalization.
“They are growing up in a generation where marijuana used to be bad, and maybe now it’s not bad,” said Mr.
Ryan, a senior prevention specialist with FCD Educational Services, an antidrug group that works with students in the classroom.
“Their parents are telling them not to do it, but they may be supporting legalization of it at the same time.
” Antidrug advocates say efforts to legalize marijuana have created new challenges as they work to educate teenagers and their parents about the unique risks that alcohol, marijuana and other drugs pose to the developing teenage brain.
These educators say their goal is not to vilify marijuana or take a stand on legalization; instead, they say their role is to convince young people and their parents that the use of drugs is not just a moral or legal issue, but a significant health issue.
“The health risks are real,” said Steve Pasierb, the chief executive of the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids.
“Every passing year, science unearths more health risks about why any form of substance use is unhealthy for young people.
” Already nearly half of teenagers — 44 percent — have tried marijuana at least once, according to data from the partnership.
One in four teenagers report using marijuana in the past month, and 7 percent report frequent use — at least 20 times in the past month.
Even in the states where marijuana is legal, it remains, like alcohol, off-limits to anyone younger than 21.
But the reality is that once a product becomes legal, it becomes much easier for underage users to obtain it.
This summer, the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids released its annual tracking study, in which young people were asked what stopped them from trying drugs.
Getting into trouble with the law and disappointing their parents were cited as the two most common reason young people did not use marijuana.
The concern now is that legalization will remove an important mental barrier that keeps adolescents from trying marijuana at a young age.
“Making it legal makes it much more accessible, more available,” said Dr.
Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
“This is the reality, so what we need to do is to prevent the damage or at least minimize it as much as possible.
” Drug prevention experts say the “Just Say No” approach of the 1980s does not work.
The goal of parents should not be to prevent their kids from ever trying marijuana.
Instead, the focus should be on practical reasons to delay use of any mind-altering substance, including alcohol, until they are older.
The reason is that young brains continue to develop until the early 20s, and young people who start using alcohol or marijuana in their teens are far more vulnerable to long-term substance-abuse problems.
The brain is still wiring itself during adolescence, and marijuana — or any drug use — during this period essentially trains the reward system to embrace a mind-altering chemical.
“We know that 90 percent of adults who are addicted began use in teenage years,” Mr.
“They programmed the reward and drive center of their teenage brain that this is one of those things that rewards and drives me like food does, like sex does.
” Studies in New Zealand and Canada have found that marijuana use in the teenage years can result in lost I.
Pasierb says the current generation of young people are high achievers and are interested in the scientific evidence about how substance use can affect intelligence.
“You have to focus on brain maturation,” he said.
“This generation of kids wants good brains; they want to get into better schools.
Talk to a junior or senior about whether marijuana use shaves a couple points off their SATs, and they will listen to you.
” Because early exposure to marijuana can change the trajectory of brain development, even a few years of delaying use in the teen years is better.
Research shows that young adults who smoked pot regularly before the age of 16 performed significantly worse on cognitive function tests than those who started smoking in their later teenage years.
Drug educators say that one benefit of the legalization talk is that it may lead to more research on the health effects of marijuana on young people and more funding for antidrug campaigns.
The Partnership for Drug-Free Kids plans to continue its “Above the Influence” marketing campaign, which studies show has been an effective way of reaching teenagers about the risks of drug use.
The campaign does not target a specific drug, but it teaches parents and teens about the health effects of early drug use and tries to empower teens to make good choices.
“Legalization is going to make the work we do even more relevant,” Mr.
“It’s part of the changing drug landscape.

Mardi Gras , also Fat Tuesday[1][2][3][4][5] in English, refers to events of the Carnival celebrations, beginning on or after the Epiphany or King's Day and culminating on the day before Ash Wednesday.
Mardi Gras is French for "Fat Tuesday", reflecting the practice of the last night of eating richer, fatty foods before the ritual fasting of the Lenten season.
Related popular practices are associated with celebrations before the fasting and religious obligations associated with the penitential season of Lent.
The date of Fat Tuesday coincides with that of celebrations of Shrove Tuesday, from the word shrive, meaning "confess".
[6] Popular practices include wearing masks and costumes, overturning social conventions, dancing, sports competitions, parades, debauchery, etc.
Similar expressions to Mardi Gras appear in other European languages sharing the Christian tradition, as it is associated with the religious requirement for confession before Lent begins.
In many areas, the term "Mardi Gras" has come to mean the whole period of activity related to the celebratory events, beyond just the single day.
In some American cities, it is now called "Mardi Gras Day".
[1][2][3][4][5] It also has become a single people's counter to the coupled-centric Valentine's Day.
[5] The festival season varies from city to city, as some traditions consider Mardi Gras the entire period between Epiphany or Twelfth Night and Ash Wednesday.
[7] Others treat the final three-day period before Ash Wednesday as the Mardi Gras.
[8] In Mobile, Alabama, Mardi Gras-associated social events begin in November, followed by mystic society balls on Thanksgiving,[7][9] then New Year's Eve, followed by parades and balls in January and February, celebrating up to midnight before Ash Wednesday.
In earlier times parades were held on New Year's Day.
[7] Other cities famous for Mardi Gras celebrations include Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Barranquilla, Colombia; Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago; Quebec City, Canada; Mazatlán, Sinaloa, Mexico; and New Orleans, Louisiana.
Carnival is an important celebration in Anglican and Catholic European nations.
[6] In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the week before Ash Wednesday is called "shrovetide", ending on Shrove Tuesday.
It has its popular celebratory aspects as well.
Pancakes are a traditional food.
Pancakes and related fried breads or pastries made with sugar, fat and eggs are also traditionally consumed at this time in many parts of Latin America and the Caribbean.
In the Belgian city of Binche the Mardi Gras festival is one of the most important days of the year and the summit of the Carnival of Binche.
Around 1000 Gilles dance throughout the city from morning until past dusk, whilst traditional carnival songs play.
In 2003, the "Carnival of Binche" was proclaimed one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.
Carnival is the most famous Brazilian holiday.
During this time period Brazil attracts 70% of its tourists.
Variations in carnival celebrations are observed throughout the multitude of Brazilian cities.
Yet, a commonality observed among them is the incorporation of samba into the celebrations.
The southeastern cities of Brazil have massive parades that take place in large sambadromes.
The largest carnival celebration in Brazil and the world occurs in Rio de Janeiro, where two million people are found celebrating in the city.
The city of Salvador also holds a large carnival celebration.
The celebration of Mardi Gras in Germany is called Karneval, Fastnacht, or Fasching, depending on the region.
[10] Fastnacht means "Eve of the Fast", but all three terms cover the whole carnival season with famous parades held in Cologne, Mainz, and Düsseldorf on the Monday before Ash Wednesday, called Rosenmontag (Rose Monday).
The traditional start of Fasching is on November 11th at 11:11am (11/11 11:11).
In Italy Mardi Gras is called Martedí Grasso (Fat Tuesday).
It's the main day of Carnival along with the Thursday before, called Giovedí Grasso (Fat Thursday), which ratifies the start of the celebrations.
The most famous Carnivals in Italy are in Venice, Viareggio and Ivrea.
Ivrea has the characteristic "Battle of Oranges" that finds its roots in medieval times.
Italy is the birthplace of Carnival celebrations, having its origins in the ancient Roman festival of Saturnalia.
The Italian version of the festival is spelled Carnevale.
[11] The Netherlands also has a festival similar to Mardi Gras.
It's called Carnaval and is similar to the Venice Carnival.
The origin of the word Carnaval is 'Carne Vale' which means "Goodbye to the meat" in Latin.
It marks the beginning of lent leading up to Easter.
The carnival in the Netherlands is mainly held in the southern part of the Netherlands in the provinces of Noord-Brabant and Limburg, some parts of Zeeland and in eastern parts of Twente and Gelderland.
As with many popular festivals, people tend to loosen some moral codes and become laid-back or loose, which is based in the ancient role-reversal origins of Carnaval, including dressing in costumes.
In Sweden the celebration is called Fastan, when you eat fastlagsbulle, also called Fettisdagsbulle.
That name comes from the words "fett" (fat) and "tisdag" (Tuesday).
Originally, this was the only day one should eat fastlagsbullar.
[12] While not observed nationally throughout the United States, a number of traditionally ethnic French cities and regions in the country have notable celebrations.
Mardi Gras arrived in North America as a French Catholic tradition with the Le Moyne brothers,[13] Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, in the late 17th century, when King Louis XIV sent the pair to defend France's claim on the territory of Louisiane, which included what are now the U.
states of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.
[13] The expedition, led by Iberville, entered the mouth of the Mississippi River on the evening of March 2, 1699, Lundi Gras.
They did not yet know it was the river explored and claimed for France by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1683.
The party proceeded upstream to a place on the east bank about 60 miles downriver from where New Orleans is today, and made camp.
This was on March 3, 1699, Mardi Gras, so in honor of this holiday, Iberville named the spot Point du Mardi Gras (French: "Mardi Gras Point") and called the nearby tributary Bayou Mardi Gras.
Bienville went on to found the settlement of Mobile, Alabama in 1702 as the first capital of French Louisiana.
[14] In 1703 French settlers in Mobile established the first organized Mardi Gras celebration tradition in what was to become the United States.
[13][15][16][17] The first informal mystic society, or krewe, was formed in Mobile in 1711, the Boeuf Gras Society.
[15] By 1720, Biloxi had been made capital of Louisiana.
The French Mardi Gras customs had accompanied the colonists who settled there.
[13] In 1723, the capital of Louisiana was moved to New Orleans, founded in 1718.
[14] The first Mardi Gras parade held in New Orleans is recorded to have taken place in 1837.
The tradition in New Orleans expanded to the point that it became synonymous with the city in popular perception, and embraced by residents of New Orleans beyond those of French or Catholic heritage.
Mardi Gras celebrations are part of the basis of the slogan, Laissez les bons temps rouler, (Let the good times roll).
[13][not in citation given] Other cities along the Gulf Coast with early French colonial heritage, from Pensacola, Florida; Galveston, Texas; to Lafayette, Louisiana, have active Mardi Gras celebrations in balls.
In the rural Acadiana area, many Cajuns celebrate with the Courir de Mardi Gras, a tradition that dates to medieval celebrations in France.

Though a pretty terrible year by many measurements, what with the Great Depression, Prohibition, and the Dust Bowl all raging, 1932 was an excellent year for tile, as this listing in the Miracle Mile illustrates quite nicely.
Located behind ivy-covered walls on South Curson, just below Olympic, the Spanish-style residence features four bedrooms, three beautifully tiled baths, hardwood floors, carved doorways, beamed ceilings, wrought-iron detailing, French doors, crystal doorknobs, three fireplaces—including one near the outdoor dining patio—a petite swimming pool, a guesthouse with kitchenette and full bath, and a two-car garage.
05 million, it's now asking $1.
It will be your only chance, until next year, to see thousands of photographs in and on shipping containers.
Among them are images of ground zero taken by a firefighter after the Sept.
11 attacks, distorted by saltwater.
This was not an artistic decision: The negatives owned by the firefighter, Lt.
Michael Redpath, were soaked when Hurricane Sandy flooded his basement in Belle Harbor, Queens.
“Some of them are interesting, the way the saltwater affected the image,” said Lieutenant Redpath, 51, who also is a painter, sculptor and furniture maker.
But he never intended for the images to be anything other than a faithful document of what he saw during the cleanup.
“The water was pouring in through every crack and crevice and we grabbed what we could and left,” he said.
“Unfortunately the negatives weren’t grabbed.
” A family member scanned the negatives, but inadvertently threw away the originals.
Niko Koppel, a Times photo editor, contacted Lieutenant Redpath after hearing his story from one of the firefighter’s neighbors, and proposed curating a slide show last year.
“People say it’s almost like a painting, that it evoked a lot of feelings,” Lieutenant Redpath said.
The images will be projected every night this weekend and next at Brooklyn Bridge Park in Dumbo.

Students at John Bowne High School, in Flushing, Queens, will do just that today, when officials and students from Oneida County return to show them the ins and outs of maple syrup production.
The Future Farmers of America of Vernon-Verona-Sherrill High School produce around 1,000 gallons of syrup a year.
(New York State is the second biggest producer of maple syrup in the country after Vermont.
) According to the New York State Conservationist, the students “tap trees, insert spouts, install tubing or hang buckets and lids, collect sap, haul the sap with a tractor and tanker, filter the sap at the sap house, operate an evaporator, and bottle and label the syrup.
” The trailer contains no trees.

From Capital Tonight: The state’s highest court has dismissed a lawsuit brought by a group of 50 taxpayers who challenged state government’s constitutional authority of doling out economic development grants and tax breaks to private companies.
In a 4-2 ruling handed down today by the state Court of Appeals, Judge Theodore Jones wrote there were no grounds for suit despite the questioning “the wisdom of policy choices.
” Judges Eugene Pigott and Robert Smith wrote separate dissents, taking a more word-for-word interpretation of the constitutional argument in the suit.
Wrote Pigott: “Unconstitutional acts do not become constitutional by virtue of repetition, custom or passage of time.
But that is what the majority opinion holds today.
The arguments made by these defendants are precisely the kind of claims that sully taxpayers’ view of our State government.
It is unfortunate that the majority gives credence to those arguments and, as a result, deprives these plaintiffs – 50 New York State taxpayers who are attempting to exercise their right to air their grievances – of an opportunity to conduct the most basic discovery to support their claims.
Pride Month offers a chance to celebrate the LGBTQ community's collective contribution to advancing human rights for all, which has been undertaken by well-known individuals and organizations as well as individuals and organizations that have quietly worked to change hearts and minds in the most unlikely of places.
Somewhere between well-known and unknown fall the many foundations that have collectively invested more than a billion dollars to advance legal equality and improve the lives of LGBTQ people.
Some of the highlights of over four decades of LGBTQ philanthropy include: While LGBTQ philanthropy has grown a few thousand dollars in 1970 to over $120 million in 2012, it still accounts for a fraction of one percent of the approximately $50 billion U.
foundations award, LGBTQ issues receive 24 cents.
So as we celebrate pride today, we know that tomorrow it's back to work.
All of these memorable moments and many more are chronicled in Funders for LGBTQ Issues report Forty Years of LGBTQ Philanthropy, 1970-2010, which was researched and written by Tony Bowen of the Annie E.

If ever there were a cause which should unite us all, old or young, rich or poor, climate change must be it.
On Sunday September 21, the world witnessed possibly the largest ever demonstration on climate change in history.
Several members of the Elders stood in solidarity with demonstrators at a major march in New York City.
Wherever you are, I hope you are making your voice heard.
The science is clear and tells us that human actions are the dominant cause of climate change in the modern era.
However, human action can also reverse this trend.
This is within our reach, but only if political and businesses leaders set aside their own narrow interests and show leadership that extends beyond the next electoral cycle or the next shareholder meeting.
Today, on September 23, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon hosts 120 world leaders in New York to prepare a global response to the worsening climate crisis.
This summit is yet another milestone of a process that will last months, culminating in the landmark 2015 Climate Change Conference in Paris.
We have a duty to be exceptionally ambitious.
As Elders, we have been in politics for some time.
We know the importance of bold and visionary words from world leaders.
The higher they set their sights, the better the agreement in 2015.
We need leadership now, not tomorrow.
From Manhattan to the Maldives, no one escapes the impacts of climate change.
After all, its consequences are felt across all societies as the European flood victims, the Philippine typhoon victims or those who bore the brunt of wildfires from California to Australia can attest to.
Climate change, as I write this, is causing displacement, fuelling conflict and jeopardizes development across the world.
You could say that either these delegates in New York succeed, or we all fail.
But that would be absolving the rest of us from our responsibilities.
Let us send a clear and unequivocal signal that failure to act will have consequences at the ballot box for politicians and for the bottom line of businesses.
If leaders are unwilling to lead when leadership is required, people must.
Annan is the founding chair of the Kofi Annan Foundationand also chairs The Elders and the Africa Progress Panel.

This post is part of a month-long series produced by The Huffington Post in conjunction with a variety of events being held in September recognizing the threats posed by climate change.
Those events include the UN's Climate Summit 2014 (that was held Sept.

The Hollywood Freeway is one of the principal freeways of Los Angeles, California (the boundaries of which it does not leave) and one of the busiest in the United States.
It is the principal route over the Cahuenga Pass, the primary shortcut between the Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley.
It is considered one of the most important freeways in the history of Los Angeles and instrumental in the development of the San Fernando Valley.
[1] It is the second oldest freeway in Los Angeles (after the Arroyo Seco Parkway).
[1] From its southern end at the East Los Angeles Interchange to its intersection with the Ventura Freeway in the southeastern San Fernando Valley (the Hollywood Split), it is signed as part of U.
It is then signed as State Route 170 north to its terminus at the Golden State Freeway (Interstate 5).
The freeway runs from the Four Level Interchange in downtown Los Angeles to the Golden State Freeway in the Sun Valley district of Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley.
From the Four Level Interchange to its intersection with the Ventura Freeway in the southeastern San Fernando Valley (also known as the Hollywood split), the freeway is signed as part of U.
Route 101; thereafter, it is signed as State Route 170.
The intersection of the Hollywood and Pasadena Freeways, known as the Four Level Interchange, is one of the major landmarks in Los Angeles and a symbol of the city's post-World War II development.
The entire route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System.
[2] SR 170 begins its northbound route at the junction with the Ventura Freeway.
SR 134 heads to the east and US 101 continues to the west.
On the southbound side, a sign indicates "END Route 170.
" Curiously, there is no interchange from SR 134 West to US 101 South.
This connector route was put on hold pending the construction of the Laurel Canyon Freeway, which never came to fruition.
Motorists intending to go in that direction must exit SR 134 at Cahuenga Boulevard, make a left, continue on Lankershim Blvd.
and follow the signs near Universal Studios to re-enter on US 101.
Likewise, there is no interchange from US 101 North to SR 134 East.
Motorists intending to go in that direction must exit US 101 at Vineland Ave.
, make a right, make another right on Riverside Dr.
This interchange is also known as the "Hollywood Split.
" SR 170 then continues through the northeastern portion of the San Fernando Valley, finally merging onto northbound I-5.
There is no connector route to I-5 South because the angle between the two freeways is too acute.
There are HOV lanes in operation 24 hours a day in each direction of SR-170 between I-5 and the Hollywood Split interchange.
As part of the I-5 improvements, construction has begun on the interchange of SR 170 and I-5 to make the current SR 170 carpool lanes connect with the proposed I-5 carpool lanes.
This as well as improve traffic flow in and out of the interchange.
When the I-5 improvements are completed, SR 170 carpoolers will be able to connect with the I-5 carpool lanes as well as the SR-14 carpool lanes (from the I-5) without merging into regular lanes.
Plans for the Hollywood Freeway officially began in 1924 when Los Angeles voters approved a "stop-free express highway" between Downtown Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley.
[1] The first segment of the Hollywood Freeway built was a one and a half mile stretch through the Cahuenga Pass.
That segment opened on June 15, 1940.
It was then known as the "Cahuenga Pass Freeway.
" Pacific Electric Railway trolleys ran down the center of this freeway until 1952.
The next section of the freeway that stretched from the San Fernando Valley to Downtown Los Angeles opened on April 16, 1954 at a cost of $55 million.
The final section, north of the Ventura Freeway to the Golden State Freeway was completed in 1968.
[1] A year after the Hollywood Freeway opened, it was used by an average of 183,000 vehicles a day, almost double the capacity it was designed to carry.
Actor Bob Hope called it the "biggest parking lot in the world" in his routine.
[1] The segment through Hollywood was the first to be built through a heavily populated area and requiring the moving or demolition of many buildings, including Rudolph Valentino's former home in Whitley Heights.
The freeway was also designed to curve around KTTV Studios and Hollywood Presbyterian Church.
[1] Much of the rubble and debris from the buildings removed for the freeway's construction was dumped into Chávez Ravine, the current home to Dodger Stadium.
[1] In 1967, the Hollywood Freeway was the first freeway in California that had ramp meters.
[1] Near the Vermont Avenue exit, there's a seemingly over-wide center strip now filled with trees.
This is where the never-built Beverly Hills Freeway was to merge with the Hollywood Freeway.
Plans for the Beverly Hills Freeway were halted in the 1970s.
[3] The Hollywood Freeway is an expansion of the original Cahuenga Parkway, a short six-lane freeway that ran through the Cahuenga Pass between Hollywood and Studio City.
The Cahuenga Parkway featured Pacific Electric Railway "Red Car" tracks in its median, but by the 1950s these tracks were out of service due to radical reductions in Red Car service.
The Pacific Electric right-of-way later accommodated an additional lane in each direction.
The Hollywood Freeway is Routes 101 and 170 from Route 110 (Four Level Interchange) to Route 5.
[4] SR 170 was originally supposed to run from the I-5 interchange to I-405 near the Los Angeles International Airport as the Laurel Canyon Freeway under the Laurel Canyon Boulevard, Crescent Heights Boulevard and La Cienega Boulevard alignments of today.
In fact, much of La Cienega Blvd.
between Manchester Avenue and Venice Blvd.
was constructed to freeway standards, with several grade-separated interchanges, although it is now an expressway maintained by Los Angeles County.
California's legislature has relinquished state control of the segment of SR 170 along Highland Avenue, and thus that portion is now maintained by the City of Los Angeles.
[5] Except where prefixed with a letter, postmiles were measured on the road as it was in 1964, based on the alignment that existed at the time, and do not necessarily reflect current mileage.
R reflects a realignment in the route since then, M indicates a second realignment, L refers an overlap due to a correction or change, and T indicates postmiles classified as temporary (for a full list of prefixes, see the list of postmile definitions).
[6] Segments that remain unconstructed or have been relinquished to local control may be omitted.
The entire route is in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County.
Today is Bisexual Visibility Day, a time for bisexual people and our allies around the world to celebrate our attraction to more than one gender.
And, the word "visibility" is key.
Bisexual people make up more than fifty percent of the LGBT community, yet are often invisible because we're perceived as straight or gay, depending on the gender of our partners.
Sometimes it's tempting to blend in.
Bisexuals regularly encounter the attitude that we're "greedy" or that our orientation is just a rest stop on the way to gay town.
We face disproportionate levels of substance abuse, suicide and eating disorders compared with our gay and straight counterparts.
Advice columnists even encourage us stay in the closet (thanks, Prudence).
But, being bisexual can be wonderful.
We're a community that includes people of all different gender identities, from cis to trans, and envelope other sexual orientations, such as queer and pansexual.
We've empowered ourselves to define bisexuality on our own terms, and evolved the term "bisexual" to encapsulate more than just male and female identities.
Most wonderfully of all, we are a community that has the capacity to love beyond the limits of sex and gender.
I celebrate today because of the freedom to define myself as both bisexual and queer, and to honor the bisexual community's rich history of activism on behalf of all LGBT people.
In honor of 2014's Bisexual Visibility Day (also referred to as Celebrate Bisexuality Day and Bisexual Pride Day), I asked fellow bisexuals why they're celebrating.
"Celebrating bisexuality creates visible safe spaces and community for those who are just coming out; so they know they are neither alone, nor abnormal.
" - Elizabeth Mechem, Mom and Secretary 3.
"Celebrating bisexuality is celebrating diversity.
It is celebrating pride for who we are.
We are celebrating the courage it takes to be our true authentic selves in a world that is continually trying to shape us into a 'socially acceptable paradigm.
'" - Dave Coleman, Engineering Services Operations Manager 4.
"I celebrate Bisexual Visibility Day for all the bisexuals who have been active in LGBT movements, often while facing biphobia from queer and straight people alike while having their contributions erased or minimized.
I love Bisexual Visibility Day or Celebrate Bisexuality day or whatever you call it because it shows we are important and deserve to be acknowledged.
And it tells people who are just coming out as bisexual that they are real and part of a dynamic community.
" - Sarah Stumpf, Bisexual Activist 5.
Because I met my hot bi husband at Berkeley BiFriendly, and now we can ogle all genders together.
" - Jan Steckel, Author of The Horizontal Poet and Lambda Literary Award Winner 6.
"There is something exquisite and profoundly beautiful about the capacity to love other human beings in a way that doesn't take gender into account as a 'deal-breaker.
' Bisexuality is bigger than itself, in that it allows for love while teaching us new meanings/ways of love - and that's cause for celebration.
" - Amy Andre, Co-author of Bisexual Health: An Introduction 7.
"Given that many of the health disparities in the bi community are due to lack of support, I celebrate bi visibility in order to make my community healthier.
" - Margaret Robinson, Re:searching for LGBT Health 8.
"I celebrate bisexuality because my innate capacity for attraction and affection toward people of all genders has enriched my life and the lives of my lovers, friends, spouses and family in countless ways, told and untold, and because my identity as a bisexual brought me into the queer movement 25 years ago and allowed me to participate in the amazing unfolding of sexuality awareness and sex-positivity that continues our society; I celebrate bisexuality because it is an essential part of what I love about myself and humanity.
" - Kate Harlan, Assistant Organizer for amBi Los Angeles 9.
"I celebrate bisexuality because our community understands how important it is to love people for who they are, not what body they were born with.
" - Ellyn Ruthstrom, President of the Bisexual Resource Center 10.
"Bisexuality is definitely something to celebrate in myself, because without it I wouldn't have met my partner, consciously created our family or become involved in helping others feel seen for who they are, regardless of imposed monosexual limitations.
What I have done for this years Bisexual Awareness Week is to craft a Jewish blessing for our bi community, "Blessed are you, Adonai our G.
d, Holy One of Blessing, who allows us to be open about our lives, see beyond gender and blesses us with myriad affections to share with our loved ones.
" This blessing is personal, and yet adaptable to the many ways we live our lives.
" - Martin Rawlings-Fein, Director, Bay Area Bisexual Network 11.
"Because someone who witnesses your joy might be a bisexual, too.
" - Tiggy Upland, Advice Columnist for the Bisexual Resource Center 12.
"I celebrate bisexuality because celebration of identity builds community empowerment and facilitates authentic living.
Chairperson of the Bisexual Organizing Project 13.
"And why celebrate bisexuality.
So everyone who was like me and felt wrong, broken and alone knows they are not.
I celebrate my bisexuality to let others know they can be proud of their diversity and resiliency.
To let them see we are not our stereotypes.
And we are worthy of human respect and decent treatment.
I celebrate my bisexuality for my beautiful community.
" - Lynnette McFadzen, Co-Host of The BiCast 14.
"Because my bisexuality is a significant part of who I am.
I have the capacity to love people all across the vast gender spectrum, and that is a beautiful thing.
Walkley, Author of Queer Greer, Choice and Vuto 15.
, Psychologist and Co-Founder of the Los Angeles Bi Task Force, amBi LA, and Fluid UCLA 16.
"When we have the courage to come together in community as ourselves with all the others whom society would also reject, we become not only an irresistible force, but, we become, in fact, the majority.
It is only by being fully myself, an out and proud bisexual woman, that I stop worrying what others think of me.
When I step out of my closet, those who would oppress me and others like me, cower back into their closets.
And, as we know all too well, it's hard to hard to change the world from a closet.
" - Heidi Bruins Green, Chair, Bisexual Advisory Committee, Out & Equal Workplace Advocates 17.
"I celebrate bisexuality because it breaks down binaries embracing the fluidity of sexuality and gender.
" - Eliel Cruz, Journalist at The Advocate 18.
"For over thirty years my bisexuality has invited me to love others at the deepest level of the soul, loving beyond the garment of gender identity, growing my insight into the human condition, my compassion and my spiritual maturity.
" - Rabbi Debra Kolodny, Editor of Blessed Bi Spirit: Bisexual People of Faith 19.
"Until 100 percent of the bi community can feel positive about the term "bi.
" Until everyone can be lifted out of the closet in all communities gay or straight.
Until the last question, such as "Pick a side," or "Are you straight now that you are married.
" stops being mouthed; I will celebrate Bi Pride Day every year.
My goal was simple when I started Bi Social Network back in 2008.
It was to help people who didn't feel they have a voice to come out and be counted.
Now, we are getting there, many voices are singing proudly---but just like racism, we still have a long way to go in media, news, entertainment and especially our community.
" - Adrienne McCue, Bi Social Network 20.
"Celebration is about demanding attention.
Without us (the loud, the proud, the labeled bisexuals), it would be so easy to pretend we don't exist.
" - Heron Greenesmith, Policy Attorney and HuffPost Blogger 21.
"I celebrate bisexuality specifically because I understand the power in naming and claiming ourselves; it is essential to our well-being and the building of community that we recognize both ourselves and those like us.
"The wellbeing of so many people who love and desire others across different genders depends upon the existence of affirming models, examples and communities.

Italy's Centenarian Generation: As more and more Italians reach their 100th birthdays, younger generations are supporting a growing social safety net yet have fewer job opportunities.
PERDASDEFOGU, Italy — On a recent Sunday afternoon, hundreds of villagers gathered in this tiny Sardinian town for a Mass to celebrate the 100th birthday of Claudina Melis, one of its esteemed citizens.
But she was not the first to reach that milestone.
Melis in the front pew was her 105-year-old sister, Consolata; they both had dark kerchiefs and wore traditional black widows’ garb.
Nearby sat five other Melis siblings, all older than 85, and their families.
In 2012, the Melis family entered the Guinness World Records for having the highest combined age of any nine living siblings on earth — today more than 825 years.
Sustained by good genes, fresh air, healthy food, physical exercise, quick wit and powerful family bonds, the Melises have become elderly symbols of a Mediterranean way of life that is the envy of the world.
But scroll down through the generations and another pattern emerges.
Few of the nine Melis siblings have formal education beyond fifth grade.
(Claudina and Consolata stopped at the second.
) Many of their children have high school or university degrees and are now retired from public or private sector jobs.
And their children, the ones born after 1970, generally have university degrees — and are struggling to find work.
With older people in the Mediterranean living longer and longer lives — and with fertility rates low and youth unemployment soaring in Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal — experts warn that Europe’s debt crisis is exacerbating a growing demographic crisis.
In the coming years, they warn, there will be fewer workers paying into the social security system to support the pensions of older generations.
As he stood outside the Church of St.
Peter’s after the birthday Mass, wearing a red, green and white tricolor sash, the mayor of Perdasdefogu, Mariano Carta, 44, acknowledged the issue.
“Absolutely, we’re in big trouble,” he said.
“We may have good air, but without work, we can’t survive.
” High up in the mountains of eastern Sardinia, Perdasdefogu, whose economy revolves around an Italian military base now under scrutiny for possible uranium contamination, has lost 500 inhabitants in the past 20 years, its population dropping to 2,000 people.
Today it has two pensioners for every worker, an average age of 47 and an unemployment rate of about 25 percent.
“If we go on like this, the system won’t hold up for long,” Mr.
Between 2001 and 2011, the number of centenarians in Italy rose 138 percent, and that of nonagenarians, or people in their 90s, rose 78 percent.
In 2011, the most recent year in the official statistics, 20 percent of Italians were over the age of 65.
The Melis siblings were all born in Perdasdefogu to Francesco Melis and Eleonora Mameli, who had a general store.
Consolata, 105, is the oldest; then Claudina, 100; Maria, 98; Antonino, 94; Concetta, 92; Adolfo, 90; Vitalio, 87; Fida Vitalia, 81; and Mafalda, the baby at 79.
Their descendants now account for about a third of the village.
The siblings remember when malaria was rampant in Sardinia before it was eradicated with the help of the United States after the Second World War.
They remember the time before Perdasdefogu got electricity in the 1950s, and before it had running water.
“We used to have to carry a bucket to the well,” said Claudina, sitting at home among family members a day before her birthday.
“Young people today don’t know what it is to work,” she said.
She meant that they had not known hard physical labor.
But the remark could just as easily apply to Italy’s youth unemployment rate, which is 38 percent.
Many qualified Italians leave for better jobs abroad in a brain drain that weighs on the country’s mood and economy.
Stefano Lai, 27, one of Claudina’s many grandchildren, grew up in Cagliari, the capital of Sardinia, and is now doing a postdoctoral fellowship in biomedical engineering at the prestigious Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna in Pisa.
He would like to stay in Sardinia, or even in Italy, but does not have his hopes up.
“Leaving Sardinia was hard for me,” Mr.
“To leave Italy would be hard, but maybe it’s inescapable,” he added.
“The opportunities are few, at least in my field.
” Standing outside the church after the Mass, Stefano’s parents, Italo Lai, 77, who retired from a job in public health, and Marina Caria, 68, were saddened at the prospect.
“We hope that maybe they can find something to keep them,” she added, referring to the three-month-old coalition government of Prime Minister Enrico Letta, who has said that tackling youth unemployment is a priority.
“Living your life near the ones you love is priceless compared to having to leave, even for work,” Stefano Lai said.
His cousin Alberto, 19, who lives in Perdasdefogu, agreed.

People receive a free meningitis vaccine from Dr.
Wayne Chen at the AIDS Healthcare Foundation pharmacy on April 15, 2013 in Hollywood, California.
(credit: Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) NEW YORK (CBSNewYork/AP) – New York City’s Health Department says it’s investigating three cases of meningitis that have developed in HIV-positive gay men over the last two weeks.
The department says Friday it’s recommending meningitis vaccinations for all men who regularly have intimate contact with other men.
It says men with HIV are at a greater risk of acquiring meningitis.
The department says two cases of the often-deadly disease were reported within the last three days.
All of the recent cases were in Brooklyn or Queens, WCBS 880’s Jim Smith reported.
A previous meningitis outbreak among gay men ended in February 2013 after 22 cases were reported.
“Unfortunately it looks like that outbreak has come back again,” Deputy Health Commissioner, Dr.
As Varma explained, meningitis has a safe and available vaccine, and warned those in the targeted population to not take any chances.
“Men who have sex with men who have HIV infections absolutely must go see their doctors and get vaccinated if they haven’t already done so,” he said.
Early symptoms are similar to the flu, with fever, chills, weakness and muscle aches.
It may later include headache, stiff neck, and widespread rash.
The Gowanus Canal is contaminated with noxious pollutants, and some of its banks, like at Carroll Street, are dumping grounds.
More Photos » The Environmental Protection Agency designated the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn a Superfund site on Tuesday and announced plans to clean up more than a century’s worth of noxious pollutants there.
The decision ended a contentious debate and was a blow to the Bloomberg administration, which had proposed a cleanup without such a designation.
The city had argued that the label could set off legal battles with polluters, prolong the dredging operation and spook developers leery of the stigma of a Superfund listing.
But in a conference call with reporters, Judith A.
administrator for the region, said the Superfund designation would guarantee the best result for residents and the environment and ensure that the polluters cover all the costs.
“We believe that it would get us the most efficient and comprehensive cleanup,” Ms.
From Gowanus Bay to New York Harbor, the agency has found contamination along the entire length of the clouded 1.
8-mile canal in a preliminary assessment, including pesticides, metals and the cancer-causing chemicals known as PCBs.
The agency estimates that the project will last 10 to 12 years and cost $300 million to $500 million.
The city estimated that its approach would take nine years.
, which proposed the Superfund designation last April at the urging of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, made its decision after a public comment period that involved more than 50 meetings with city officials, developers, community groups and others.
Nine other Superfund sites across the country were also designated on Tuesday.
“It was the right thing to do,” said Marlene Donnelly, a leader of the neighborhood group Friends and Residents of Greater Gowanus.
“It’s the beginning of a plan to start the restorative process for the Gowanus area.
” City officials expressed disappointment but struck a conciliatory tone and pledged to cooperate with the cleanup.
“It’s disappointing,” said Marc La Vorgna, a spokesman for Mayor Michael R.
“We had an innovative and comprehensive approach that was a faster route.
” “But we are going to work closely with the E.
because we share the same goal: a clean canal,” he added.
Carved out of tidal wetlands and streams in the 1860s, the Gowanus evolved into a busy waterway for oil refineries, chemical plants, tanneries, manufactured gas plants and other heavy industry along its banks.
Industrial waste and raw sewage gushed into the canal for over a century.
Most of that flow has halted since the 1960s as maritime shipping faded.
Today the 100-foot-wide canal is used for commercial and recreational purposes by neighborhoods bordering it, including Park Slope, Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens and Red Hook.
Yet even as kayakers glide alongside the banks and fishermen catch striped bass for sport at its mouth at Gowanus Bay — the fish are too contaminated to eat — residents complain about the odors from continuing discharges of sewage and unsightly debris from scrap metal yards and other industrial enterprises.
has already identified the city, the Navy and seven companies, including Consolidated Edison and National Grid, as potentially responsible for the past discharges.
It is seeking additional information from at least 20 other companies so it can map out the financing of the cleanup.
Holloway IV, a former mayoral aide who helped design an alternative cleanup plan for the Gowanus and is now the commissioner of the city’s Department of Environmental Protection, said he had no estimate of New York’s financial liability for what federal officials said included contamination from various facilities, including an asphalt plant and an incinerator in the area.
He said the city would work with the E.
to ensure that costs are recovered from all responsible parties.
“The city has an obligation to ensure that the burden is shared fairly,” Mr.
He noted that the administration had already committed $150 million to reducing odors and preventing sewer discharges and had shared the cost of a feasibility study for an environmental restoration project by the Army Corps of Engineers.
officials said they saw those projects as complementary and expected them to continue.
Holloway said it was uncertain how the Superfund designation would affect economic development in the area.
One developer, Toll Brothers, said it would scrap its plan for a $250 million project with about 450 housing units and retailing space on three acres by the canal.
“We wouldn’t be able to obtain financing to build, and we’d have difficulties obtaining insurance,” said David Von Spreckelsen, a senior vice president with the company, citing factors like uncertainty on how long the cleanup would take.
But Gowanus Green, a $300 million project for 774 units of new housing in nine buildings as well as retailing and community facilities, mostly financed by the city, is going forward.
“We’re in full support of the project, and we’ll work with the E.
,” said Aaron Koffman, a spokesman for the Hudson Companies, one of the companies in the project’s consortium.
Eager to preserve such development potential, the city had proposed an approach under which the federal agency would allow the polluters to pay for the cleanup voluntarily.
Enck said the city’s plan lacked “financial certainty” because it relied partly on federal allocations that would require Congressional approval.
Agency officials also worried that having the Corps of Engineers and the E.
both tackle the cleanup would complicate an already messy challenge.
In advocating for a Superfund listing, Ms.
Enck had rejected arguments that it would keep investors and lenders away.
“Banks look at the environmental conditions of the properties,” she said at a meeting with reporters last week.
“It is not a secret in Brooklyn that the Gowanus is contaminated.
The notion that Superfund is going to create a stigma just doesn’t hold up.
” Agency officials said the cleanup, which will focus chiefly on the sediment in the canal, had effectively begun, with sampling already under way.
The timetable calls for completing the sampling and assessments of human and environmental risks by the end of the year.
A full cleanup plan is to be drafted by 2014, with the work then unfolding over at least five years.
Walter Mugdan, the agency’s regional Superfund director, said that most of the canal would probably be dredged.
Additional steps include eliminating all sources of continuing contamination, like overflowing sewage and the migration of contaminants from groundwater under old industrial plants.

The rooms are padded, but not for anyone’s comfort.
The announcement from the anticorruption authorities in Beijing that all of the capital’s districts and counties must install at least three “discussion rooms” was instead meant to drive home the government’s unrelenting resolve in prosecuting corrupt officials.
The orders come as the Chinese capital has seen a huge increase in the number of graft cases under investigation.
Citywide the number of investigations into official corruption rose to 772 over the first eight months of this year, an increase of 64 percent over the same period in 2013, according to a report Tuesday in The Beijing News.
The report said that the Beijing Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection, the local office of the Communist Party’s anticorruption body, ordered the construction of the interrogation rooms at all its local offices as a way of turning the crackdown on corruption into a more regular, institutionalized part of operations even at the lowest levels of government.
The rooms have bars over the windows and padded walls, tables and chairs.
“Here you can not only achieve a suitably serious atmosphere for investigations, but this infrastructure can help increase the efficiency in handling cases,” the newspaper said.
“In the past, when grass-roots discipline inspection officials held meetings with their subjects, they usually had to use an empty meeting room or office.
” The padded rooms are intended to prevent officials under investigation from injuring themselves.
Amid the current crackdown, about 30 officials have killed themselves this year.
A handful of officials have also died in custody, apparently from abuse suffered at the hands of investigators in the Communist Party’s opaque system for investigating its own members, known as shuanggui.
The word literally means “double regulation,” referring to the designated time and place for a session.
An academic with the Central Party School of the Communist Party has argued that suicides of officials accused of corruption are no reason to end the investigations, and that more should be done to pursue their relatives and contacts.
“By escaping from judicial and possibly disciplinary penalties once and for all, the officials suspected of corruption can not only preserve their titles and honor, but also preserve the material gains they have made for their families, since their illegal income will no longer be confiscated,” Lin Zhe wrote on Monday in the state-run China Daily.
“Considering the astonishing sums of money an official can obtain through corruption, that’s a good deal for them and their families.
Lin said that continuing investigations into dead officials’ wealth would demonstrate the resolve of the anticorruption effort.
Likewise, investigators told The Beijing News that they were calling for the construction of new interrogation rooms to show that the antigraft crackdown is not a passing phase.
“Anticorruption efforts shouldn’t become a campaign” — a temporary political movement — the paper said, paraphrasing Zhu Lijia, a scholar with the China National School of Administration.
“Setting up a system and rules will help normalize the anticorruption fight.
forward Kevin Hayes plays against Switzerland during the International Ice Hockey World Championships in Minsk on May 10, 2014.
(ALEXANDER NEMENOV/AFP/Getty Images) On Wednesday afternoon, the New York Rangers announced the signing of unrestricted free agent forward Kevin Hayes.
The terms of the contract were not released by the team, but it’s believed Hayes agreed a two-year, entry-level contract.
This is a big get for the Blueshirts, who have done a fine job of stockpiling highly coveted college free agents, including Union defenseman Mat Bodie, RPI winger Ryan Haggerty and University of Vermont forward Chris McCarthy.
The Rangers needed to acquire a forward with offensive upside after losing winger Benoit Pouliot to the Edmonton Oilers via free agency and having exercised their final compliance buyout on veteran center Brad Richards.
Hayes has the body to play the power forward game and boasts impressive tools.
At 6-foot-3 and weighing a little more than 200 pounds, Hayes has the body to be a strong possession player.
That means he’ll fit right in with the Rangers, as head coach Alain Vigneault demands players who are strong on the puck.
Hayes also has a great pair of hands and solid playmaking vision.
He’s a natural right winger who also has the versatility to slot in at center.
The Boston College standout produced big points in his final year with the Eagles, scoring 27 goals and registering 38 assists in 40 games during his senior year.
He was a plus-34 and was penalized just 16 minutes.
Hayes was named to the NCAA East First All-American Team and Hockey East’s First All-Star Team.
He was also a Hobey Baker Finalist.
He does have a reputation for being a somewhat streaky scorer.
Hayes recorded a 12-game point streak last season, but also went through a few dry spells during past seasons at B.
This is no different than any player his age.
Rangers fans will have to accept the good with the bad while Hayes gains consistency alongside experience.
Hayes became an unrestricted free agent on Aug.
15 after allowing his contract with the Chicago Blackhawks to expire.
This allowed the Rangers and a number of teams to make their pitches to the former 2010 first-round pick.
According to multiple reports, the Boston Bruins, Colorado Avalanche and Nashville Predators were among the teams in the running to sign Hayes prior to him agreeing to terms with the Rangers.
Expect Hayes to suit up for the Blueshirts right away.
The 22-year-old will compete for a bottom-six forward spot and is an immediate upgrade over prospects Jesper Fast, J.
HAYES TO BE REUNITED WITH KREIDER Chris Kreider likely played a big role in helping sway Hayes toward signing with the Rangers.
The duo played two seasons together at Boston College.
Hayes played alongside highly touted Calgary Flames prospect Johnny Gaudreau last season at B.
The Eagles suffered a 5-4 upset loss to Union in the Frozen Four semifinals.
Restricted free agent defenseman John Moore has yet to agree to terms on a new contract.
The 23-year-old blueliner is not arbitration eligible.
In all likelihood, Moore will agree to a two-year bridge deal before training camp at an annual rate slightly above the Rangers’ qualifying offer of $850,500.
The Rangers have yet to announce an official date for training camp, though it is expected to begin close to Sept.
Once Moore puts pen to paper, the Rangers’ three defense pairings will be locked in.
The Ryan McDonagh-Dan Girardi pairing will remain unchanged.
Veteran two-way defenseman Dan Boyle is the best candidate to replace Anton Stralman on the right side of shutdown guy Marc Staal.
Moore is best suited to remain on the left side of the Rangers’ third pairing alongside Kevin Klein.
Prior to the signing of Hayes, 22-year-old Swedish winger Fast stood a strong chance at locking down a spot on the Rangers’ fourth line.
The promising youngster’s path to the NHL now appears to be blocked.
Fast will likely begin the 2014-15 season at Hartford.
Unless the Rangers’ roster is hit by a major injury, Fast will probably spend next season working on his development in the AHL.
The speedy winger did not register a point in 11 regular season games last season with the Rangers.
He had an assist in three games during the playoffs.
Fast scored 17 goals and contributed 17 assists in 48 games for Hartford in 2013-14.
I don’t think this comes as news to anyone here, but it can be a real challenge to parent and to educate adolescents.
My own specimens (boys, 11 and 15) spend their days vacillating between energetic and catatonic, optimistic and morose, ebullient and apathetic.
Some days, I doubt that they will be able to forge a safe and successful path into adulthood without my constant help and intervention.
Laurence Steinberg says this is not the case.
In his new book, “Age of Opportunity: Lesson From the New Science of Adolescence” Dr.
Steinberg explains that sure, adolescence is challenging, but it is also a time of great opportunity.
I loved the book, so I reached out to him and asked for advice on how to best parent and to teach adolescents.
Given some information about how the adolescent brain is wired, and a few tips on how to parent children who can have trouble accessing their reserves of self-control and motivation, the children will be all right.
First, a primer on the adolescent brain.
While human brains reach their full size by age 10, that brain is far from fully cooked, neurologically speaking.
Adolescence is a time of an extraordinary reorganization of resources in the brain, particularly with respect to the prefrontal cortex, the center of self-regulation, and the limbic system, the seat of emotion.
Steinberg suggests that we view adolescent brain development in three overlapping stages: 1.
Starting the engines: When puberty first hits, the limbic system becomes more easily aroused, and young teenagers can shift between extreme, euphoric highs and unpredictable, precipitous lows.
Developing a better braking system: During middle adolescence, the prefrontal cortex slowly inches toward maturity, which will eventually allow teenagers to master self-control, and yes, they will return to a more reasonable and mature cognitive and emotional state.
Putting a skilled driver behind the wheel: Once the brakes of self-control are functional, it’s a matter of fine-tuning, of practicing until those brakes work every time, in all conditions.
There is not much we can do to rush this process of neurological maturation along, but what parents and teachers can do is to help children practice their burgeoning skills of self-control as they emerge.
The children who are most likely to emerge from adolescence with a strong sense of self-control, motivation and competence, Dr.
Steinberg writes, are those who have been parented according to three goals: warmth, firmness and support.
Children raised by warm, firm and supportive parents – what Dr.
Steinberg refers to as “authoritative” parenting – emerge from adolescence with more well-honed skills of self-regulation, and are much less likely to fall victim to delinquency, addiction, obesity and premarital pregnancy.
Steinberg provides the following prescription for helping children navigate adolescence and figure out how regulate their feelings, thoughts and behaviors: Be Warm.
Warm parents react to children’s emotional needs so they can muster the bravery required to function away from parents, under their own initiative.
They show their children that they not only understand their emotional needs, but also will respond to them.
They provide a safe haven and are involved in their child’s life.
Firm parents establish clear rules, even clearer expectations, and predictable consequences.
Most importantly, they follow through with those consequences when expectations are not met.
“Children acquire self-control by taking the rules that their parents have imposed on them and imposing them on themselves,” Dr.
Firm parents are consistent and fair, explain their rules and decisions, and avoid harsh punishment that is out of scale with the wrongs committed.
The best way to support children is by “scaffolding,” Dr.
Scaffolding is just what it sounds like; the supports parents erect around our children should support them only as much as they require, and as they become better at managing themselves, those external controls should come down.
Parents who set children up to succeed, praise efforts rather than outcomes, help them think through their own decisions rather than making decisions for them, and refrain from being overly intrusive, will be able to dismantle those parenting supports gradually, and as they do so, their children will find that they are capable of standing tall on their own without crumbling when the world shakes them up a little bit.
I don’t think adolescence will ever be easy, either for my boys or for me, but I am trying to keep up my end of the deal by removing one piece of their scaffolding, every day.
When my older son violates curfew, or my younger son takes off into the woods with my saw and his knife to whittle a staff out of a sapling, I look to my favorite piece of advice from Dr.
Steinberg’s book, propped up in the back of my desk: “Protect when you must, but permit when you can.
This week's weather forecast needs a radical mid-week adjustment.
On Monday it seemed like the high pressure system covering the eastern half of the country would shunt a coastal storm out to sea, limiting the storm's impact on New York.
That dance is no longer on the schedule.
Instead the high is further east and weaker than expected and that should result in an unpleasantly windy and rainy Thursday.
Before the storm hits we should have an increasingly cloudy afternoon and a high in the lower 70s, which is just about normal for this time of year.
Rain is expected to begin after midnight as the low gradually moves up the coast.
There is no getting around it, Thursday looks to be a rainy, windy mess.
Easterly winds at 15-20 mph and 1-3 inches of rain are expected before this storm passes out of the region.
The heaviest rain is expected before noon, so there's a chance that Derek Jeter's final home game will take place as scheduled.
Tomorrow's high will stay in the 60s.
Fear not, rain-o-phobes, absolutely gorgeous weather is in store for the weekend.
Another high pressure system arrives on the heels of the storm means Friday will warm to the upper 70s under mostly sunny skies.
Clear skies are expected to continue through the weekend with highs on Saturday and Sunday reaching the upper 70s or lower 80s.
WASHINGTON — As part of the Obama administration's ongoing commitment to prioritizing the removal of criminal aliens and egregious immigration law violators, U.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) today announced the results of a seven-day national "Cross Check" enforcement operation-which led to the arrest of more than 2,900 convicted criminal aliens.
"The results of this targeted enforcement operation underscore ICE's ongoing commitment and focus on the arrest and removal of convicted criminal aliens and those that game our nation's immigration system," said ICE Director John Morton.
"Because of the tireless efforts and teamwork of ICE officers and agents in tracking down at large criminal aliens and fugitives, there are 2,901 fewer criminal aliens in our neighborhoods across the country.
" This seven-day operation, the largest of its kind, involved the collaboration of more than 1,900 ICE officers and agents from all of ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations' (ERO) 24 field offices, as well as coordination with our federal, state and local law enforcement partners throughout the United States.
Arrests occurred in all 50 states and four U.
All of the 2,901 individuals taken into custody had prior criminal convictions including at least 1,282 aliens who had multiple criminal convictions.
More than 1,600 of those arrested had felony convictions including manslaughter, attempted murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, drug trafficking, child abuse, sexual crimes against minors, and aggravated assault.
Of the total 2,901 criminal aliens arrested, 42 were gang members and 151 were convicted sex offenders.
In addition to being convicted criminals, 681 of those arrested were also immigration fugitives who had previously been ordered to leave the country but failed to depart.
Additionally, 386 were illegal re-entrants who had been previously removed from the country multiple times.
Because of their serious criminal histories and prior immigration arrest records, at least 146 of those arrested during the enforcement action were presented to U.
S attorneys for prosecution on a variety of charges including illegal re-entry after deportation, a felony which carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.
ICE conducted the first successful Cross Check operation in December 2009, and has since conducted Cross Check operations in 37 states, including regional operations in the Southeast, Northeast and Midwest regions.
In May, ICE conducted the first nationwide Cross Check operation.
These previous Cross Check operations resulted in ICE arresting 4,506 convicted criminals, fugitives and aliens nationwide who have illegally re-entered the United States after removal.
Last week's enforcement action was spearheaded by ICE's National Fugitive Operations Program (NFOP), which is responsible for locating, arresting and removing at-large criminal aliens and immigration fugitives.
The officers who conducted last week's operation received substantial assistance from ICE's Fugitive Operations Support Center (FOSC) and ICE's Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC) both located in Williston, Vt.
ICE is focused on smart, effective immigration enforcement that targets serious criminal aliens who present the greatest risk to the security of our communities, such as those charged with or convicted of homicide, rape, robbery, kidnapping, major drug offenses and threats to national security.
ICE also prioritizes the arrest and removal of those who game the immigration system including immigration fugitives or those criminal aliens who have been previously deported and illegally re-entered the country.

Mosquito-borne viruses are showing up unexpectedly in affluent countries where they have been largely unknown.
Yoyogi Park, a popular oasis in downtown Tokyo, was closed last week after authorities realized it was the center of Japan’s first outbreak of dengue in 70 years.
Dengue is also called breakbone fever for the severe joint pain it causes.
Repeat infections can cause dengue hemorrhagic fever, which can be lethal.
Since Japanese authorities detected the first case Aug.
27, 65 more have been found, most of them associated with Yoyogi Park.
The victims included two models covering the outbreak for a local television station.
Fear of the virus is spreading.
In Yokohama, officials closed a large beach park after one local woman infected in Tokyo said she was later bitten by a mosquito there.
In the United States, more than 750 cases of another painful disease, chikungunya, have been reported this year.
Almost all have been in tourists returning from the Caribbean, where the disease is rampant, particularly in the Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Haiti, Martinique and Puerto Rico.
Nine million Americans visit the Caribbean each year.
But Florida residents who had not traveled were infected this summer, and the virus was found in a Texas mosquito, meaning that it is becoming established in the United States.
Chikungunya was unknown in the Western Hemisphere until late last year.
Victims can often be seen walking stooped over with pain; the name means “bent up” in Makonde, an East African language.
Most victims recover within a week, but in some, the pain persists for years.
FREETOWN, Sierra Leone — The gravedigger hacked at the cemetery’s dense undergrowth, clearing space for the day’s Ebola victims.
A burial team, in protective suits torn with gaping holes, arrived with fresh bodies.
The backs of the battered secondhand vans carrying the dead were closed with twisted, rusting wire.
Bodies were dumped in new graves, and a worker in a short-sleeve shirt carried away the stretcher, wearing only plastic bags over his hands as protection.
The outlook for the day at King Tom Cemetery was busy.
“We will need much more space,” said James C.
Hamilton, the chief gravedigger, as a colleague cleared the bush with his machete.
The Ebola epidemic is spreading rapidly in Sierra Leone’s densely packed capital — and it may already be far worse than the authorities acknowledge.
Since the beginning of the outbreak more than six months ago, the Sierra Leone Health Ministry reported only 10 confirmed Ebola deaths here in Freetown, the capital of more than one million people, and its suburbs as of Sunday — a hopeful sign that this city, unlike the capital of neighboring Liberia, had been relatively spared the ravages of the outbreak.
But the bodies pouring in to the graveyard tell a different story.
In the last eight days alone, 110 Ebola victims have been buried at King Tom Cemetery, according to the supervisor, Abdul Rahman Parker, suggesting an outbreak that is much more deadly than either the government or international health officials have announced.
“I’m working with the burial team, and the first question I ask them is, ‘Are they Ebola-positive.
Parker, adding that the figures were based on medical certificates that he had seen himself.
The deaths are carefully recorded by name and date in a notebook headed “Ebola Burials.
” A burial team supervisor who drove up with fresh bodies echoed Mr.
“Any body we collect is a positive case,” said Sorie Kessebeh.
“All the bodies that we are bringing in are positive.
” Beyond the many worrisome trends in the Ebola epidemic seizing parts of West Africa — the overflowing hospitals, the presence of the disease in crowded cities, the deaths of scores of health workers trying to help — another basic problem has stymied attempts to contain the disease: No one seems to know how bad the outbreak really is.
The World Health Organization acknowledged weeks ago that despite its efforts to tally the thousands of cases in the region, the official statistics probably “vastly underestimate the magnitude of the outbreak.
” Here in Sierra Leone, the government just finished an aggressive national lockdown to get a handle on the epidemic, ordering the entire country to stay indoors for three days as an army of volunteers went door to door, explaining the dangers of the virus and trying to root out hidden pockets of illness.
Still, the Health Ministry spokesman insisted that the epidemic was not as bad as the flow of bodies at the cemetery suggested.
“It is not possible that all of them are Ebola-related deaths,” said Sidie Yahya Tunis, the Health Ministry spokesman, saying the corpses included people who died of other causes.
But as the cemetery records show, the challenge facing the government might be of a different magnitude than previously thought.
The majority of the recent deaths recorded at the cemetery were young people — young adults, people in early middle age, or children — with very few elderly people on the list.
Several of the deaths also occurred in a concentrated area, sometimes in the same house, suggesting that a virulent infection had struck.
At the house of Marion Seisay — the third name on the list — her son acknowledged she was a secretary at Wilberforce Hospital, had died of Ebola and was buried on Sept.
The house was now under quarantine, with some of its eight residents lingering on the cinder-block porch.
“The way my Mummy died was pathetic,” said the son, Michael Foday, clearly frustrated by the quarantine.
“How do you expect us to get food.
” Other houses in Wilberforce Barracks, the village-like compound surrounding the hospital, were on the list of the dead and placed under quarantine, marked off from the surrounding jumble of shacks and cinder-block houses by a thin line of red or blue string.
In one of them, the house of Momoh Lomeh, the residents said that a total of five people who lived there had died of Ebola — yet four of them did not even appear on the cemetery list.
At another, the house of Andrew Mansoray, a family member said that the disease had been ruthless and unrelenting.
Kallon said of the diarrhea that Mr.
Mansoray, his brother-in-law, had endured before dying.
“They took him to the hospital, and they wouldn’t let him out.
” At another six households on the cemetery supervisor’s list of the dead, residents gave similar accounts.
One family said the victim had definitely died of Ebola, while five others described Ebola-like symptoms — vomiting, diarrhea, fever — though none had been given an official cause of death.
International health experts here had no explanation for the striking discrepancy between the government’s tally of the dead in the capital and the cemetery crew’s statistics.
Several of them noted the general confusion surrounding official statistics here from the beginning, with one leading international health official saying: “We don’t know exactly what is going on.
” But nobody disputed that things appear to be getting worse.
has shown a sharp increase in new cases in Freetown in recent weeks, rising from almost none early in the summer to more than 50 during the week of Sept.
Various models of the growth of the epidemic here “all show an exponential increase,” said Peter H.
Kilmarx, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team in Sierra Leone.
“The conditions are amenable to Ebola spread.
” The goal of the government’s national lockdown was to reach every household in the country, and officials claimed success in doing so on Monday, saying that progress had been made in the fight against the disease.
But the exhaustion of the Ebola gravediggers at King Tom Cemetery, who dig as many as 16 graves a day, indicated that the disease was far from being contained.
“It’s a herculean task,” said Mr.
Hamilton, the chief gravedigger.
“It’s only out of patriotism that we are doing it.
” The Ebola victims were buried in an expanding stretch of fresh muddy graves under a giant cotton tree, and the makeshift arrangements are seen as a looming threat by the residents of the slum next to it.
No barrier stops the pigs rooting in the adjoining trash field from digging in the fresh Ebola graves, which residents say they often do.
“We have creatures in the community, and they dig in the graves,” said Henry S.
Momoh, who lives in the adjoining slum, which residents call Kolleh Town.
“They are burying the Ebola patients in there, but not in the proper manner.
” Five yards from where the new graves begin, a well-used path connects the slum to the main road.
Residents all use it, passing close to the freshly dug graves, and are frightened by the intensifying activity in the cemetery.
“Since last month, it’s every day, any minute and hour, and often, they are coming” to bury the Ebola dead, said Desmond Kamara, a police officer.
A cloudy stream drains from the area of the new graves into the slum, further frightening the residents.
“We are at risk, big risk,” said Ousman Kamara, a resident.
” But the bodies, he said, keep coming.
“You stand here, and you see them coming.

Kindles, iPads and smart phones have made reading more accessible, interactive and engaging for many students.
Search the web for “reading apps for kids” and you’ll find hundreds, even thousands, of ways to encourage reading on screens.
But a growing body of research suggests that our brains process digital reading very differently from paper reading and that we need to make sure that we – and students – can do both.
“Linear reading, which is something we humans have developed over years and years, is what we need to do when we want to do deep reading—like immerse ourselves in a novel, or read a mortgage document,” says WNYC reporter Manoush Zomorodi in a recent story on the issue.
“Dense text that we really want to understand requires deep reading, and on the Internet we don’t do that.
Plasma: How the Digital Reading Shift is Impacting Your Brain,” Zomorodi notes that researchers like Maryanne Wolf of the Center for Reading and Language Research at Tufts University recommend “setting some time aside each day to deep read with a paper medium.
” Do you personally find that reading on screens is different than on paper.
Teachers, have you noticed a difference in how students comprehend information that is read on a screen versus information that is read on paper.
Listen to the original episode of WNYC’s New Tech City here.
Corporate education reformers like to beat up on teachers under the pretext that teachers are the cause of the achievement gap, as if child poverty, class size and school funding play no part in a child’s opportunities for success.
In a new article at Slate, reporter Dana Goldstein has a bold proposition: “To fix schools, stop beating up on teachers and start paying attention to their bosses.
” While we may not agree with everything Goldstein says in her new book, The Teacher Wars: A History of America’s Most Embattled Profession, she makes an interesting case that effective principals are crucial in shaping a school’s mission and helping teachers build their pedagogical skills.
“When McKinsey surveyed top teachers on what it would take for them to move to a higher-poverty school, they responded that the biggest draw, even more important than a raise, would be a respected principal who created a positive school environment,” Goldstein writes.
“In short, principals have a unique power to multiply the effects of good teaching and help close achievement gaps.
Do principals make a big difference in schools.
What makes a principal an effective leader.
What are some ways you think principals can support teachers’ pedagogy.
Many people have weighed in on the importance of due process for teachers.
Here’s one Brooklyn teacher’s perspective, which she posted last month on her blog, My Life as a NYC Teacher.
My first two years of teaching were awful.
It wasn’t anyone’s fault, not even mine.
I simply didn’t know what I was doing.
I should have gotten a U rating.
My administrators knew it was growing pains.
It did not make me any less embarrassed to be observed.
I didn’t make much growth because I didn’t know how to take suggestions and turn them into action… yet.
Well, things aren’t perfect but I know what I’m doing.
I am still growing and learning, but that will continue every year, and not just in teaching, but in every aspect of my life, for the rest of my life.
I learned by experience and by heeding the advice of veteran teachers whom I admire greatly.
But what if I were a tenured teacher.
What if I had a few years under my belt.
What if I were accused of something that I may or may not have done, by an administrator.
What if he/she just didn’t like me.
Or wanted to replace me with his/her friend’s niece’s cousin.
Without due process, which is guaranteed by and the object of tenure, a teacher becomes an at-will employee.
All the work he/she has done with students, all the time and effort put into being an educator, would be snatched out from underneath him/her.
The media, thanks to Campbell Brown (formerly Michelle Rhee) and the education reform movement, wants to do just that.
Propaganda such as “lifetime employment as a teacher granted by tenure” permeates the debate.
Her organization, Partnership for Educational Justice, helps fuel the fire by spreading such falsehoods.
Shadowing the grave injustice of the tenure defeat in California, Brown and PEJ is supporting seven parents in a lawsuit against New York State’s teacher tenure laws” calling for the overhaul of teacher tenure, because, they claim, unions protect “bad teachers.
” Another lawsuit, once again, looms in the air.
A parent in this new suit claims that “That same teacher allegedly gave Natalie [her daughter] good grades despite her being unable to read.
” So why not take it up with that teacher.
“The complaint does not name the allegedly incompetent educators, but argues that tenure laws lead to bad teachers.
” So if that is the case then “Mississippi (with no teacher tenure) should have stellar schools and Massachusetts (with teacher tenure) should have failing ones.
Instead, it’s the other way around.
Correlation is not causation, of course, but across the country the states without tenure are at the bottom of performance rankings.
States with the highest-achieving public schools have tenure (and teacher unions).
” Point-by-point, Brown’s arguments are unfounded.
She, like her reform movement counterparts at Students First, is a union-buster.
This is not a new tactic for the reform movement.
Education reformers are mostly well-intentioned in that they want to improve schools and help students, especially our neediest ones.
However, how to go about doing so are at odds with what most veteran educators believe would make a difference.
Reformers believe in school choice, charters, improvement of teacher quality by way of merit pay and firing “low-performing” teachers.
Teachers unions not only protect teachers (as they should because they are LABOR unions), but they are large advocates of education.
They lobby for better workplace conditions (kids are part of that workplace); we can advocate for students without fear of retaliation; unionized states produce higher-achieving students; they provide (often free) professional development so we can get better (I frequently attend UFT PDs); and they often hold events for teachers and students celebrating our accomplishments.
Veteran teachers who oppose the reform movement know that there are many outside factors that affect student performance, such as abuse, hunger, homelessness, lack of parental support/supervision and illness.
Many of these issues are rooted in larger societal problems that affect the community at large, such as poverty and institutional racism.
It is indeed possible for children to overcome these circumstances and teachers can be a factor in that, but it is often the exception rather than the rule.
We need the support of those around the child in the other parts of his/her life.
Charters have the ability to screen student admissions as well as expel students for behavioral issues.
Those students wind up back in community schools.
Merit pay creates competition between teachers when we need to be working together.
I know of very few teachers who are in it for the money.
If a teacher is indeed low-performing year after year, or is found to have done something wrong, he/she is fired.
All tenure guarantees is just cause.
Do we really want to give absolute power to administrators to get rid of teachers for any reason they choose (just or unjust), without a hearing.
Yes, the education system needs an overhaul, but attacking teachers and bashing teachers unions isn’t the way to do it.
Reformers, we agree on the destination: better schools and equity for students.
But we need to get on the same roadway.
(And not to privatization of our public schools).
As a former “low-performing” teacher, I am grateful that no one gave up on me.
I am proud to be a member of the most powerful union[s] in the country.
After all, how can anyone get better if we do not practice.
I attend professional development and constantly learn from wonderful veteran teachers to inform my practice.
Teaching is, after all, a practice.
Catch it while it’s here: the American Folk Art Museum is exhibiting the artwork of a working-class American original, Ralph Fasanella, from Sept.
Fasanella’s colorful, lively and detailed paintings are infused with history and politics and dense with visual descriptions of life in a still-recognizable New York City from an earlier era.
Born in 1914, Fasanella worked many different jobs, beginning at age 8 when he assisted his father, an iceman, delivering ice to local homes in that pre-refrigeration age.
He went on to work as a labor organizer, gas station attendant and truck driver— but found his calling as a self-taught painter, recreating the world of the Lower East Side which he grew up in and knew intimately.
Fasanella brought to his art a strong sense of social justice.
In “Family Supper,” one of his various paintings depicting his hardworking Italian immigrant family, his mother, a garment worker, is at the center.
“The Iceman Crucified #4,” shows his father on a cross, a representation of the struggles of the working class.
The trial of the Rosenbergs, the assassination of President Kennedy, Watergate, the 1912 Bread and Roses strike in Lawrence, Mass.
— all found their way into Fasanella’s work.
He also painted some of the more pleasant parts of working people’s lives, including the joys of baseball or stoop-sitting outside apartment buildings, and the more mundane, such as his piece showing tired subway riders on the way home from work.
Fasanella painted in obscurity for many years, until a 1972 New York magazine cover story shot him to fame, comparing him to another self-taught American master, Grandma Moses.
It was a comparison he vehemently rejected, but his work sold well from that time on.
In the 1980s, he teamed with a union organizer in a project called Public Domain which successfully raised money to buy back some of his works so they could be exhibited in public spaces such as the 53rd Street subway, the Ellis Island Museum and union halls throughout the country.
Whether for your own enjoyment or as a springboard for teaching your students about New York and labor history, you won’t want to miss Ralph Fasanella: Lest We Forget, at the American Folk Art Museum, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, NY, NY 10023.

The huge and troubling racial imbalance in admissions to New York City’s specialized high schools recently prompted a UFT task force to recommend altering the current test-only admissions process to improve equity and access.
But some alumni of the elite schools told The New York Times on Aug 26 that they oppose such changes.
The grads base their arguments on an interesting assumption: that admitting more black and Latino students into Stuy, Bronx Science, Brooklyn Tech or the other five specialized schools would dilute the academic rigor of their alma maters by taking in students “who can’t do the work,” in the words of one alum, or who “can’t keep up.
” Graciously, the alums suggest expanding test prep for disadvantaged students to help them score higher on the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test.
But beyond that they offer no solutions to the wild racial imbalances in admissions to these schools.
In 2012-13, of 830 students who were offered admission to Stuyvesant, only nine were black and 24 were Latinos.
That’s 4 percent combined, in a school system where blacks and Latinos make up 70 percent of enrollment.
Earlier this year, the UFT task force made up of teachers from those very high schools did offer solutions.
They recommended “thinking beyond the test,” and taking steps to improve equity and access.
There are students capable of doing the work, the task force said, who haven’t been given the opportunity because the sole entry criterion is a single, flawed, test.
As one Stuyvesant teacher on the panel said, “I think I speak for just about all the teachers in my building when I say that we would want to opt for a system that was fairer in terms of admitting kids into our building.
” In its March 2014 report the task force recommended seven creative educational solutions that would maintain the elite reputations of the specialized high schools while allowing them to look more like the city they serve.
1) Creating a pathway that would target top-performing 8th graders at every middle school, and taking at least one top student from each, proportional to enrollment; 2) Using a composite “power score” for admission, based on student grade point average, ELA and math results, attendance, participation in advanced classes and a revised test for the specialized schools, which would look at more dimensions of student excellence; 3) Revising the SHSAT, the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test, to better reflect the content that is taught in the city middle schools; 4) Pre-registering all city 8th graders for the test, so they don’t depend on their parents hearing about it and signing them up; 5) Making prep materials free online so families without the means to enroll their children in test-prep get access and level the playing field; 6) Ensuring every middle school family knows about the schools; 7) Putting a Discovery Program into each of the schools to identify and develop promising students for admission.
The gap between rich and poor has never been greater in our city, the task force notes.
“Our best public schools represent unique opportunities to level the playing field.
” Instead of remaining so racially imbalanced, they could become genuine centers of citywide excellence.
Since when do due process rights for teachers hinder students’ ability to learn.
That’s blogger Kristin Wald’s reaction to the lawsuit filed by seven parents in New York State that seeks to erode due process protections for teachers.
In a post titled “Without Tenure — Everything Is Awesome.
writer highlights the absurdity of faulting teachers’ due process rights when students struggle to perform: It must be the teachers, you see.
Because it couldn’t be fine motor skills or exposure to reading and learning at home.
And it couldn’t be socio-economic status that poses particular challenges.
It couldn’t be health complications for a student or a student’s family.
Of course it couldn’t be anything about the parents or community that affects a child’s learning.
And certainly the ability to learn wouldn’t be affected by status as an English Language Learner or having stresses outside of school… So it must be the teachers who are at fault.
It must be tenure that is the problem.
Remove a teacher’s protection from dismissal without due process and she’ll work harder, fall into line, do what she’s told, scramble to get class test scores up, and be better.
Wald closes her post by calling for those who attack teachers’ rights to take on the challenge of truly supporting students and teachers: Those suing to get rid of tenure should spend their time & money ensuring excellent pre-K prep & long-term support for all students.
… If you truly want excellent teachers, work for excellent working conditions instead of destroying the protections that tenure provides.
Former CNN talk show host Campbell Brown is all over the headlines these days, but not for her skills as a journalist.
Instead, Brown has reinvented herself as the face of attacks on teacher tenure, teacher unions and the teaching profession.
“My view of public education,” claims Brown, “begins and ends with the fundamental question: Is this good for children.
” Based on the lawsuit that Brown and her organization, the Partnership for Educational Justice, plan to file in New York — modeled on Vergara v.
California, which led to the striking down of California’s tenure and seniority statutes — Brown apparently thinks that what’s good for children is firing their teachers.
In her criticism of the lawsuit on her blog, education activist Diane Ravitch notes, “One curious aspect to this copycat case is that no one has been able to establish the basic claim that every child would have a ‘great’ teacher if no teacher had due process rights or any job protections.
If people like Campbell Brown really cared about poor kids, they would fight for small class sizes, arts teachers, school nurses, libraries, and improved conditions for teaching and learning.
” Get to know Campbell Brown by reading these recent articles: “Campbell Brown goes after teacher tenure in transition from journalist to advocate,” Washington Post, July 14 “Tenure haters’ big delusion: Why Campbell Brown and co.
are wrong about teaching,” Salon, July 16 Instead of pouring more resources into high-stakes standardized tests, those working to support low-performing students should focus their energies on supporting teachers, writes education professor Linda Darling-Hammond in a blog at the Huffington Post titled “To Close the Achievement Gap, We Need to Close the Teaching Gap.
” As evidence, Darling-Hammond points to the findings of the Teaching and Learning International Surveyof 100,000 teachers worldwide, which were released last week by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The survey, she said, revealed: American teachers today work harder under much more challenging conditions than teachers elsewhere in the industrialized world.
They also receive less useful feedback, less helpful professional development, and have less time to collaborate to improve their work.
Current education policies, writes Darling-Hammond, “ignore the facts that one in four American children lives below the poverty line and a growing number are homeless, without regular access to food or health care, and stressed by violence and drug abuse around them.
Educators now spend a great deal of their time trying to help children and families in their care manage these issues, while they also seek to close skill gaps and promote learning.
” Darling-Hammond highlighted the survey finding that nearly two-thirds of U.
middle-school teachers work in schools where more than 30 percent of students are economically disadvantaged.
That is triple the average rate reported in the survey, and by far the highest rate in the world, she said.
To address these inequalities, Darling-Hammond suggests some important policy changes that would support teachers rather than penalize them: “We cannot make major headway in raising student performance and closing the achievement gap until we make progress in closing the teaching gap,” Darling-Hammond concludes.
“That means supporting children equitably outside as well as inside the classroom, creating a profession that is rewarding and well-supported, and designing schools that offer the conditions for both the student and teacher learning that will move American education forward.
” [This editorial originally appeared in the June 26 issue of the New York Teacher.
] Over the last 15 years, as the number of charter schools around the country has multiplied, the movement has increasingly become dominated by charter school networks such as Success Academy and Uncommon Schools as opposed to independent or community-based charter schools.
Researchers have found that large foundations are deliberately fueling the growth of charter school networks, also known as charter school management organizations.
One recent study, described in our Research Shows column on page 17, looked closely at the explosive growth of charter school networks in California from 1999 to 2005.
It found that four foundations had worked in concert to drive that growth: the Gates, Broad and Walton Family foundations along with the New Schools Venture Fund.
The Walton, Gates and Broad foundations are also the largest funders of charter school networks nationally.
Why would these foundations want to fund networks rather than independent schools.
A main reason is that networks can grow.
An explicit demand of the foundations in the California study was for networks to add more schools fast.
Charter school leaders interviewed for the study said foundations told them that they would receive funding only if they had a plan to scale up.
Some of the charter organizations aimed to grow big enough within a particular school district to challenge that school system.
One said that scaling up was akin to having an effect on “public education the way FedEx affected the Post Office.
” We know that the ultimate goal of many in the corporate education reform movement is to privatize public education.
These foundations and the other billionaire funders of the corporate reform movement see building up charter school networks as a pivotal part of that work.
We must call out the orchestrated, top-down growth of the charter school movement.
Studies show that charters perform no better and often worse than public schools.
And an unbridled and unregulated increase in charter schools poses a threat to public education and our democracy.
Picture a kindergarten classroom.
Chances are, your mental image doesn’t include blank walls.
But a new study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that kindergarten students in a visually stimulating classroom tended to be more distracted than those in a comparatively sterile environment.
As reported in a New York Times article, “Rethinking the Colorful Kindergarten Classroom,” this study suggests that elaborately decorated classrooms might distract from, rather than encourage, learning.
In the austere classroom in the study, the kindergartners — age-appropriately wriggly and restless — were inclined to be distracted by others or even themselves.
In the decorated one, the visuals competed with the teacher for their attention.
The children spent far more time off-task in the decorated classroom than in the plain one, and their test scores were also lower.
Teachers who agree with the study recommend starting the year with relatively blank walls and adding student work to decorate the room as the year goes on.
Yet teachers of primary grades often start the year with decorated classrooms to help create a cheerful and welcoming environment.
And many teachers have had administrators who expect them to cover every inch of wall space with some kind of chart or poster.
Tell us: What’s your reaction to this new research.
What works for you when decorating your own classrooms.
[This editorial originally appeared in the June 5 issue of the New York Teacher.
] This June, New Orleans’ Recovery School District closed its last five traditional public schools, making it the first all-charter school district in the country.
Some observers call the all-charter district a grand urban experiment.
We see the unfettered, underregulated expansion of charters as a threat to children’s education and to democracy.
After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the state took over 102 of New Orleans’ 117 schools.
More than 7,000 teachers and other school employees were booted out.
Charter operators were invited in.
Charter boosters in New Orleans point to higher state test scores and graduation rates than before Katrina.
But such comparisons are questionable because many families and students who lived in the city prior to the storm have left.
A 2010 study by the University of Minnesota Law School found that while New Orleans remains a majority African-American city, 80 percent of its white students attend the most selective, higher-performing charter schools while children of color and lower economic status attend lower-ranked schools.
Similarly, advocates for students with disabilities say children with special needs are routinely denied equal access to educational opportunities and are often pushed out of New Orleans’ charter schools.
A similar lack of fairness can be found in the treatment of educators.
While most of the fired teachers were African-American, many of the new recruits are white.
The fired educators sued for unfair termination and won.
Unequal treatment can thrive more easily in a district of privately run, though publicly funded, charter schools.
The privatization and decentralization of New Orleans schools have led to both a loss of community control and a diminished sense of community as neighborhood schools disappear.
At a time when public education is under attack, New Orleans should remind us that public schools offer both an equality of access and a sense of community essential to our diverse democracy.
“Public education isn’t important because it serves the public,” the late cultural critic Neil Postman said.
“It is important because it creates the public.

From the Epoch Times: Epoch Times spoke with two real estate owners whose properties were allegedly damaged by Huang’s practices.
Neither would speak on record, yet both were concerned about what will happen to the Huang buildings still standing.
What will happen, they each asked, when families move into homes built with potentially dangerous foundations.
Considering the hundreds of developments Huang has done in Queens since 1979, it’s a frightening prospect.
Tony Sclafani, spokesman for the DOB, said the department issued more than two dozen violations at the Queens Boulevard site, and issued several thousand dollars in fines.
They have also had inspectors at the site and others owned by Huang.
Yet, the fundamental problem, according to Sclafani, is “the department does not have the authority to refuse the issuance of a permit based solely on past work history.
Avella pointed out that Huang must be getting protection somehow.
“Obviously, somebody has been protecting him.
Because I have been after the Department of Buildings for a decade to shut him down,” Avella said.

But when the polls open in New York City for the mayoral primary, fewer than 800,000 Democrats – and fewer than 80,000 Republicans – are expected to vote.
A few voting groups play an outsize role in the outcome, simply by contributing to candidates and showing up to vote.
The Democrats considered most likely to vote – based on their behavior in past elections – are often referred to as “prime voters,” and they are aggressively courted by campaigns.
Here are key voting blocs that are likely to wield the most influence in the 2013 Democratic primary.
Where the electoral power lies in the 2013 New York Democratic mayoral primary.
This predominantly black area is home to nearly 1 in 10 of the city’s Democratic prime voters – those who voted in both of the most recent mayoral primaries – and, as a result, holds huge sway in city elections.
The area has also been particularly affected by the New York Police Department’s stop-and-frisk practice – officers stop residents here more often than anywhere else – and the policing tactic has become a huge issue in the race for mayor.

Many residents are affluent and generous political contributors.
Quinn leads in contributions from this neighborhood, raised largely in 2009, when she first contemplated a bid for mayor.
de Blasio did well here in his 2009 race for public advocate.
Prime voters: 13,952iThe number of people who voted in the Democratic mayoral primaries in 2005 and 2009.
In neighborhoods in northern Manhattan and the west Bronx where Dominican-Americans predominate, participation in city elections is high.
Thompson carried about two-thirds of the vote against Mayor Michael R.
Bloomberg here in 2009, and he has made the most appearances here this year.
Liu, who won only about 40 percent of the vote here in the 2009 primary for comptroller, and Erick Salgado, a mayoral candidate who was once a missionary in the Dominican Republic, have also been actively campaigning here.
Prime voters: 12,695iThe number of people who voted in the Democratic mayoral primaries in 2005 and 2009.
This area is liberal, politically active and affluent, but not as rich as Manhattan.
de Blasio lives in Park Slope and is popular, winning easily here in the 2009 primary for public advocate.
Quinn raised a lot of money here in 2009, but Mr.
de Blasio easily beat her in contributions this year.
Weiner did well here in the 2005 Democratic primary for mayor.
Prime voters: 8,881iThe number of people who voted in the Democratic mayoral primaries in 2005 and 2009.
Quinn earned her standing as the candidate of the establishment partly because of her prodigious lead in raising money in this rich, mostly white area.
It is the political-money capital of the city, but many residents register as Republicans, limiting the neighborhood’s impact in a Democratic primary.
Liu is not popular here, raising dimes to everyone else’s dollars.
Prime voters: 8,057iThe number of people who voted in the Democratic mayoral primaries in 2005 and 2009.
The predominantly black population here has historically had high levels of turnout in city elections.
Thompson, who has endorsements from the Harlem power brokers Charles B.
Dinkins, the city’s first black mayor, did very well here in the 2009 general election, as did Mr.
de Blasio did not, garnering only 25 percent of the neighborhood’s votes in the public advocate primary that year.
Recent polls have suggested that Mr.
de Blasio is generally doing well among black voters this year, and this could be a key test.
Prime voters: 7,188iThe number of people who voted in the Democratic mayoral primaries in 2005 and 2009.
The northeast Bronx is another area with a predominantly black population, similar to southeast Queens, but with slightly lower income and turnout.
This area was one of the best in the city for Mr.
Liu when he ran for comptroller.
Virginia Fields, an African-American woman then serving as Manhattan borough president, lost this area to Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, in the 2005 Democratic primary for mayor, but Mr.
Thompson won decisively here in the 2009 general election.
Prime voters: 5,470iThe number of people who voted in the Democratic mayoral primaries in 2005 and 2009.
New Yorkers of Italian, Irish and Polish descent are concentrated in enclaves on Staten Island; in Middle Village and Howard Beach in Queens; in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn; and elsewhere.
These groups once dominated Democratic city politics, but their impact has receded as more and more have registered as Republicans.
Liu ran first in heavily white Catholic neighborhoods in 2009.
Weiner ran exceptionally well in these areas in the 2005 Democratic mayoral primary.
Prime voters: 5,287iThe number of people who voted in the Democratic mayoral primaries in 2005 and 2009.
Liu has found voters, and contributors, in Asian neighborhoods like Chinatown in Manhattan, Flushing in Queens and Sunset Park in Brooklyn, where candidates have not done well previously.
His fund-raising in the mayoral race is a barometer: He has raised four times as much here as any candidate for mayor in the last five elections.
Liu’s ethnic base may be the only unassailable one – his opponents have hardly visited these areas.
Prime voters: 4,851iThe number of people who voted in the Democratic mayoral primaries in 2005 and 2009.
Despite its large population, this community is politically inactive.
Many residents are noncitizen immigrants who are not eligible to vote – there are only about half as many prime voters per capita here as there are in black neighborhoods.
de Blasio has not run well here in the past.
Thompson won 55 percent of the vote here in the 2009 general election against Mr.
But this is one of the predominantly Hispanic areas where Ms.
Quinn, with help from some Hispanic groups, hopes to do well.
Prime voters: 4,799iThe number of people who voted in the Democratic mayoral primaries in 2005 and 2009.
This group, represented in Forest Hills in Queens, and Riverdale in the Bronx, was a key constituency for former Mayors Edward I.
Residents of these areas reliably participate in Democratic primaries, and these neighborhoods are often a significant source of campaign contributions as well – although this year much of the political spending in Forest Hills is from Asian-Americans giving to Mr.
Prime voters: 4,776iThe number of people who voted in the Democratic mayoral primaries in 2005 and 2009.
This area on the Brooklyn-Queens border has many Puerto Ricans, as well as other Hispanics, but it has a limited impact in city elections because of low voter participation.
Quinn made several visits here in August.
Incomes tend to be higher here than in Hispanic neighborhoods in the Bronx.
Prime voters: 4,132iThe number of people who voted in the Democratic mayoral primaries in 2005 and 2009.
Many West Indian blacks live in East Flatbush, Brooklyn.
A lot of education, health care and government workers live here, which means union members.
It is also part of the stop-and-frisk nexus, a police precinct in which the practice was common.
Voter turnout is somewhat lower than in other black neighborhoods.
Prime voters: 2,782iThe number of people who voted in the Democratic mayoral primaries in 2005 and 2009.
This has been one of the least supportive communities for Mr.

NEW YORK (WFAN) — The Giants are officially eliminated from playoff contention.
And with three weeks remaining in the NFL regular season, it’s coming down to the Cowboys and the Eagles for the NFC East crown.
After Dallas (7-6) lost to Chicago on Monday night, Philadelphia leads the division by a game.
So which team does Giants safety Antrel Rolle think will win the division.
“To be honest with you, I don’t care,” the captain told WFAN co-hosts Joe Benigno and Evan Roberts during his weekly spot on Tuesday.
Whoever wins, they deserve to win.
To me, to be honest with you, I don’t care who is the better of the two.
I’m just worried about the Giants right now.
” The Giants put on an ugly display on Sunday, falling to the Chargers, 37-14, at Qualcomm Stadium.
The G-Men were never in the game, as the Chargers led 24-0 at halftime and 31-7 after three quarters.
“I think Sunday was a true testament of us going out there and being flat,” the two-time Pro Bowler said.
“We all understand that in this league there’s no room for error.
There’s no room for, even, do-overs.
You gotta go out there, you gotta have a sense of urgency, you gotta have a sense of intensity.
And that was something I think we were lacking in all three phases of the game.
” Rolle doesn’t want to hear that the team’s subpar effort had anything to do with having to fly out west.
“To be honest with you, you can say whatever you want to say,” Rolle told Joe & Evan.
“I’m not a guy that really makes excuses, because we have traveled to the West Coast before (and won) ….
You can’t say it’s because of travel, you can’t say it’s because of the schedule.
I just feel like, as players, we all understand that nothing’s going to be given to us.
” The Giants will host the mighty Seahawks on Sunday before finishing their season against the Lions in Detroit and the Redskins at MetLife Stadium.

Cajun Mardi Gras traditions date back to medieval France (and perhaps earlier; many scholars see clear ties between these traditions and pre-Christian pagan celebrations) when, on the "anything goes" holiday celebrating the last day before the Lenten fast, peasants would dress up in ridiculous costumes, generally ridiculing their "superiors" (Nobles, Clergy and Intelligentsia).
They would then travel around their area seeking alms or handouts.
The mummers of England and modern Halloween celebrations have similar roots.
In small towns in rural Louisiana, the Mardi Gras riders wake up early, get into costume, saddle up the horse and begin traversing their local village in a large parade-style group.
At each house, they dismount and beg for an ingredient for a gumbo.
Generally, the homeowner will throw them a live chicken, which they must catch, resulting in much hilarity (though some animal rights activists have concerns about this practice).
Beer is a major factor in the celebration as well, making it all the more fun to watch.
See Photos of a Traditional Cajun Mardi Gras Run Most Mardi Gras costumes are simply pants and shirts bearing large fringes of multicolored fabric.
Some people are decorated with traditional Mardi Gras colors of Green, Purple and Gold, but many are wildly multicolored.
Masks and hats are also often worn, including the traditional capuchon, a tall, pointed hat.
See Photos of Some Traditional Cajun Mardi Gras Costumes Each group of Mardi Gras riders (which sometimes number in the hundreds) are accompanied by a local Cajun band, who play the traditional "Mardi Gras Song" at each house.
The band rides on a "bandwagon", often equipped with loudspeakers or a PA system so everyone can hear.
While outsiders generally are not allowed to join the actual groups of people who are catching the chickens, they are welcome to follow behind the riders and the bandwagon.
The run in Eunice, Louisiana has become so popular among outsiders, in fact, that the 2005 run had a few thousand people following behind the actual Mardi Gras riders.
The End of the Day: When all the chickens have been caught, the riders head back into town, where a dance is held and the chickens are cooked into a gumbo (a spicy chicken and sausage stew).
At midnight, all celebrations end, for Lent has started and it's time to repent.
Most towns in the prairie regions of Southwest Louisiana have Mardi Gras runs, although some of them actually take place on the few days preceeding Fat Tuesday.
Towns with well-known runs include Eunice, Mamou, Iota, Basile and Church Point.
Also used to refer simply to the riders, called "Les Mardi Gras.
" Capitaine - The man in charge of keeping a group of Mardi Gras riders under control and leading the way.
Gumbo - A spicy chicken and sausage stew, eaten at the end of the day.
Charite' - French word for "charity", refers to the alms given out by neighbors.
Courir - French word for "run", refers to the Mardi Gras run as a whole.
The Cajun Mardi Gras Song, also known as "La Danse de Mardi Gras" and "La Vieille Chanson de Mardi Gras," is an important musical accompaniment to any traditional Mardi Gras Courir.
With a melody that is likely as ancient as the begging tradition itself, it's a necessary part of the day, and should you choose to take part in a Cajun Mardi Gras celebration, it's worth learning the words.

— This was the state that embodied the middle-class American dream: Move west, acquire a small slice of property, perhaps with a palm tree or two.
For decades, comfortable suburbs like this one just south of Los Angeles boomed with new housing tracts designed to attract the latest arrivals.
When space started to come at a premium, developers moved inland, building more homes for people who could not afford the more expensive coastal areas.
But now, cities across the state are grappling with a dwindling stock of housing that can be considered affordable for anyone but the wealthiest.
“It’s hard to imagine how all of California doesn’t become like New York City and San Francisco, where you have very rich people and poor people but nothing in between,” said Richard K.
Green, an economist and director of the Lusk Center for Real Estate at the University of Southern California.
“That’s socially unhealthy and unsustainable, but it’s where we are going right now — affordability is its worst ever, and we’re seeing a hollowing-out of the middle class here.
” The problem extends far beyond San Francisco, where wealth from the technology industry has sent housing costs skyrocketing.
In Los Angeles and Orange Counties, less than 25 percent of homes for sale are within reach of the region’s middle-class earners, according to an analysis by Trulia, a real estate website.
Of 10 markets nationwide that Trulia ranked as least affordable for the middle class, six were in California.
“I talk a lot of buyers out of sticker shock,” said Linda Ginex, a real estate agent in Orange County.
She routinely steers clients to suburbs they might not have initially considered or, for people who insist on living in the most desirable cities, into condominiums instead of houses.
“A lot of people who grow up here think they can afford what their parents had, but that’s not always realistic,” she said.
In Los Angeles, the average renter spends nearly half of his or her income on rent, according to a study released this year by the University of California, Los Angeles.
To make the rent, many families have opted to double up with other families, sometimes cramming six or seven people into a small apartment.
Denny Bak, 31, who grew up as a son of a minister in Aliso Viejo, a small city in southern Orange County, figured that with his salary as a police officer and his wife’s as a nurse, they would easily be able to find a three-bedroom house with a small yard.
But when the couple set out searching in the neighborhoods he knew best, homes were at least $800,000 — more than double what they could afford.
Eventually, they found an older, ranch-style home in La Mirada, another small city south of Los Angeles.
“We both grew up here and had this notion that we would have the same promises our parents had,” Mr.
We make good money — probably more than our parents did — and it still feels like a struggle to stay here.
” It is not only would-be homeowners who are feeling the effect.
A renter in Los Angeles County would have to make at least $27 an hour to be able to afford a two-bedroom apartment, according to a report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which estimated that the state is short of roughly one million homes for the working poor.
And while housing prices are increasing rapidly, incomes in the state remain flat.
“We can’t find any way for people earning a median income to keep up pace; that’s what’s really scary,” said Matt Schwartz, the chief executive of the California Housing Partnership Corporation, which monitors affordable housing throughout the state.
“We’ve seen this happening for a long time in San Francisco, but now it’s going on in Sacramento, in the Central Valley — the demand is far outpacing the supply.
It’s no longer just that the low-income folks are getting squeezed out of a decent place to live.
” Abel Ruiz has lived with his family in Santa Ana, an inland city in Orange County, for more than a decade.
Their landlord recently increased the rent on their one-bedroom apartment to $1,100, plus an $18 surcharge per resident, an increase of more than $300.
Ruiz, 30, works for the local parks department and has considered getting his own place.
Instead, he helps his parents make the rent.
The living room is divided in half, his mother and father sleeping on one side and his 18-year-old sister on the other.
He and his 12-year-old brother share the bedroom in the back.
“Everything is multiuse,” he said.
Sure, but that means I have to find another job, and who knows how hard that might be.
” Banks and other investors have been buying up single-family homes all over the region, particularly in parts of the state that were hit hardest during the foreclosure crisis, like the northern suburbs of Los Angeles County and the Inland Empire, a metropolitan area east of Los Angeles.
Foreign investors are paying cash for properties, as investments or as pieds-à-terre.
Some renters have complained of neglect, saying that absentee landlords ignore complaints about cockroaches or leaky pipes.
But local investors have also been buying modest single-family homes, either to lease them to tenants or to “flip” them, renovating them and selling at a profit.
Robert Ganem, a former mortgage broker, has bought more than 65 properties in the last four years.
“Things are not too far off the peak prices now, and we just see them going up and up,” Mr.
“In one complex, I bought a condo for $400,000, and six months later, the exact same model on the same floor sold for $500,000.
Ganem rents out condos in the suburbs, he typically charges $2,500 to $3,000 for a three-bedroom — and immediately has more than a dozen applicants, he said.
“It’s usually good people who got stuck in the crash — a married couple with one or two kids who need a stable place,” he said.
“I’m getting to choose who looks to be the most attractive, so I look at who has the most extra in the bank, who has the most stable job, all those kinds of things.
” Steve Twardowski, who works as an engineer for an oil company, has been looking for a home in Southern California for himself and his wife for the last year and said the process had become “a bit of a nightmare.
” “If you make six figures, you should not have trouble finding a single-family home, but we have this crazy cost of living here,” Mr.
“I don’t know how people are coming to this state because right now, it feels like it is just for rich folks.
” The couple considered leaving for Texas but eventually found a modest three-bedroom home in Long Beach.
“This is gentrification on steroids,” said Stan Humphries, the chief economist at Zillow.

“What is unique here is you have an entire state really shifting — people are bidding up prices all over the place.

The 40-year-old man showed up in Dr.
Mary Malloy’s clinic with sadly disfiguring symptoms.
His hands, elbows, ears and feet were blemished with protruding pustules and tuber-like welts, some so painful it was hard for him to walk.
He suffered from a rare genetic condition called dysbetalipoproteinemia, which caused his cholesterol levels to soar so high that pools of fatty tissue seemed to bubble up under his skin.
But there was something else about this patient.
He was missing a gene that, when present in one form, greatly increases the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.
Malloy, who co-directs the Adult Lipid Clinic at the University of California, San Francisco, and her colleagues saw an opportunity to answer an important neurological riddle: Does the absence of the gene — named apolipoprotein E, or APOE, after the protein it encodes — hurt the brain.
If a person with this rare condition were found to be functioning normally, that would suggest support for a new direction in Alzheimer’s treatment.
It would mean that efforts — already being explored by dementia experts — to prevent Alzheimer’s by reducing, eliminating or neutralizing the effects of the most dangerous version of APOE might succeed without causing other problems in the brain.
The researchers, who reported their findings on Monday in the journal JAMA Neurology, discovered exactly that.
They ran a battery of tests, including cognitive assessments, brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analyses.
The man’s levels of beta-amyloid and tau proteins, which are markers of Alzheimer’s, gave no indication of neurological disease.
His brain size was unaffected, and the white matter was healthy.
His thinking and memory skills were generally normal.
“This particular case tells us you can actually live without any APOE in the brain,” said Dr.
Joachim Herz, a neuroscientist and molecular geneticist at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, who was not involved in the research.
“So if they were to develop anti-APOE therapies for Alzheimer’s, we would not have to worry about serious neurological side effects.
” Apolipoprotein E, the protein made by the APOE gene, helps transport cholesterol.
Malloy said, it guides different proteins containing cholesterol into the liver.
In the brain, it chaperones cholesterol from neurons to a storage area while they are changing, she said, and then returns the cholesterol to neurons.
The APOE gene has several forms, and one of them, the APOE4 variant, is the biggest known genetic risk factor for the most common form of Alzheimer’s.
People with one copy of APOE4, about 20 percent of the population, have up to five times the risk of developing Alzheimer’s, compared to people without that variant, and they develop the disease earlier.
People with two copies, about 2 percent of the population, have up to 15 times the risk.
About 90 percent of people with two copies will develop Alzheimer’s by the time they are age 80.
Another form of the APOE gene, E3, is very common but poses less risk.
A third variant, E2, is rare and is the least dangerous.
Herz, who wrote an editorial about the study, said that the protein made by APOE4 slows the process of clearing beta-amyloid buildup in the brain, leading to the accumulation of the plaques associated with Alzheimer’s.
Proteins made by the other gene variants, APOE3 and APOE2, clear amyloid more quickly, and “in the absence of any APOE, the turnover is fastest,” he said.
So, it makes sense that a person with a fast-clearing form of APOE, or none at all, would have a very low risk of Alzheimer’s.
Several experts are working on ways to reduce APOE4 or increase APOE2 in the brain, and the results have been promising.
Steven Paul, a professor of neuroscience at Weill Cornell Medical College, has found that by using gene therapy to implant mice with APOE2, “we reduced plaque quite effectively and quite quickly,” even in mice that also had APOE4, he said.
Paul, who is head of research and development at Voyager Therapeutics, said he is now studying the effect in monkeys.
“If all goes well, in a year or so we could be thinking seriously about doing this in humans.
David Holtzman, chairman of the neurology department at Washington University School of Medicine in St.
Louis, found that when mice with amyloid plaques were given a monoclonal antibody that reduces APOE, the mice developed fewer plaques and cleared some of them from their brains.
Decades ago, before the link to Alzheimer’s was known, reports on a handful of people without APOE suggested that, aside from the physical side effects of astronomical cholesterol levels, they appeared otherwise normal.
But the 40-year-old man, a pipefitter who lives in California’s Central Valley and is married with three children, is the first documented case of an APOE-less person whose brain health has been rigorously tested.
He was not further identified to protect his privacy.
“This finding is important,” Dr.
It shows “that it is unlikely that APOE is key for normal brain development or function, as there are other proteins that can compensate in its absence.
Malloy’s patient is relatively young makes the results a little less strong, because amyloid accumulation in people destined to get Alzheimer’s may not begin until later in life.
Herz said, “based on what we know now, I would say this patient will most likely never accumulate amyloid.
Malloy is working to treat the man’s cholesterol problem, which has barely improved despite medication and a healthy diet.
Paul and others said anti-APOE therapies would have to target broad areas of the brain without crossing the blood-brain barrier and circulating to the liver.
They consider that a quite realistic goal.
“Things are developing incredibly rapidly these days,” said Dr.
Herz, who is not involved in creating the new therapies.
“I’m very confident that we will find approaches that address these issues.

NEW DELHI — An Indian spacecraft affectionately nicknamed MOM reached Mars orbit on Wednesday, beating India’s Asian rivals to the Red Planet and outdoing the Americans, the Soviets and the Europeans in doing so on a maiden voyage and a shoestring budget.
An ebullient Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on hand at the Indian Space Research Organization’s command center in Bangalore for the early-morning event and hailed it “as a shining symbol of what we are capable of as a nation.
” “The odds were stacked against us,” Mr.
Modi, wearing a red Nehru vest, said in a televised news conference.
“When you are trying to do something that has not been attempted before, it is a leap into the unknown.
And space is indeed the biggest unknown out there.
” Children across India were asked to come to school by 6:45 a.
Wednesday, well before the usual starting time, to watch the historic event on state television.
The Mars Orbiter Mission, or MOM, was intended mostly to prove that India could succeed in such a highly technical endeavor — and to beat China.
Modi and others have noted, India’s trip to Mars, at a price of $74 million, cost less than the Hollywood movie “Gravity.
” NASA’s almost simultaneous — and far more complex — mission to Mars cost $671 million.
Success was by no means assured.
Of the 51 attempts to reach Mars, only 21 have succeeded, and none on any country’s first try, Mr.
In 2012, China tried and failed, and in 1999, Japan also failed.
Modi, who was elected in May with a once-in-a-generation majority in Parliament, has been on something of a roll.
And the Mars achievement, which he had almost nothing to do with, will only add to that.
Modi leaves Friday for New York, where he will address the United Nations General Assembly as well as a sold-out, largely Indian-American crowd at Madison Square Garden before heading to Washington for a meeting with President Obama.
The Indian Space Research Organization has always had a small budget, and for years it largely worked in international isolation after many countries cut off technological sharing programs in the wake of Indian nuclear tests.
It has launched more than 50 satellites since 1975, including five foreign satellites in one June launch.
As other countries have rethought their pricey space programs, India’s low-budget affair has gained increasing attention and orders.
Its success has long been seen as a fulfillment of the kind of state-sponsored self-sufficiency that former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru cherished but that, in the main, left India impoverished.
More recently, India’s technological isolation in defense and other areas has been due in large part to the country’s restrictions on foreign investments, its poor infrastructure and its infamous bureaucracy.
India is now the world’s largest importer of arms because of its inability to make its own equipment and its refusal to let foreign companies open plants owned entirely by them.
The country’s most important export is the cheap brainpower of its engineers, based in technology centers like Bangalore and Hyderabad, who provide software and back-office operations for corporations around the world.
“Our success on Mars is a crucial marketing opportunity for low-cost technological know-how, which is what we do really well,” said C.
Uday Bhaskar, an analyst with the Society for Policy Studies, a New Delhi research center.
India’s space program “spent peanuts, and they got it done.
” India’s decision to launch Mangalyaan, the name of its spacecraft, resulted after China’s own mission to Mars failed in 2012.
In almost every sphere, the Chinese have outpaced the Indians over the past three decades, but Indian scientists saw an opportunity to beat them to Mars.
In just a few months, they cobbled together a mission to send a 33-pound payload of fairly simple sensors to Mars orbit.
They used a small rocket, a modest 3,000-pound spacecraft and a plan to slingshot around the Earth to gain the speed needed to get there.
A mission that began with a November launch in Sriharikota has been flawless ever since.
“In this Asian space race, India has won the race,” Pallava Bagla, author of “Reaching for the Stars: India’s Journey to Mars and Beyond,” said in an interview.
Thousands of Indian and Chinese soldiers have been engaged in a standoff for more than a week on disputed land in Ladakh, in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir, and President Xi Jinping of China recently held a three-day visit to India that was overshadowed by the border disputes.
Mangalyaan, which is the Hindi word for “Mars craft,” is slated to remain in an elliptical orbit around Mars, sending back information about Martian weather and methane levels in its atmosphere to controllers in Bangalore from sensors powered by three large solar panels.
From the Daily News: The Bloomberg administration has abandoned a controversial plan to close 10 struggling city high schools.
Just seven of 17 troubled high schools that the city tried to close this spring ended up on the chopping block in 2012 after many posted gains on city progress reports.
The city had sought to close the schools this summer and immediately reopen them with new instructors, a turnaround plan the teachers union opposed in court.
A court battle that lasted six months, ending with a judge’s ruling in the union’s favor.
Now it appears the city has reversed plans to close 10 of those schools.
Students and teachers were thrilled at schools that were spared the axe.
Newtown High School in Queens also jumped from a C to a B on its progress report this year and made it off of the city’s hit list.
From NY 1: Eleven days after Hurricane Sandy, the Rockaway Beach neighborhood around Scholars' Academy was like no-man's land.
Residents fled, leaving behind downed wires, waterlogged debris and sand soaked with heating oil.
But the doors to the school building were open, similar to what we saw at other damaged schools across the city.
Contracted crews moved in and out, pumping, repairing and decontaminating, all to get students back as soon as possible.
Yet at some point, school officials say someone must have entered the building and exited with about $100,000 worth of stolen equipment.
"We discovered that approximately 90 iPads were stolen and six to 10 iMacs," said Brian O'Connell, the principal of Scholars' Academy.
It wasn't just pricey tablets and computers.
Also reported missing were two automated external defibrillators, each estimated to be worth about $1,600.
This was not an isolated incident.
The New York City Department of Education says 30 schools have reported looting so far.

Mount Sinai Hospital Queens in Long Island City is moving forward with a sweeping $113 million expansion that would erect a state-of-the-art five-story medical building on its campus.
“We need a medical facility to accommodate the growing neighborhood,” Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas told the Daily News on Monday.
“There are many young families moving in.
” The state issued a contingent approval letter last month, an important hurdle before construction can begin on the facility, agency officials said.
The operator, which is part of the larger Mount Sinai hospital network, will still have to submit legal documentation to the agency before final approval, Health Department spokesman Peter Constantakes said.
“The project will provide significant improvements to emergency and urgent services, imaging, endoscopy, ambulatory surgery, physician space, operating rooms and patient support spaces,” according to an executive summary prepared following an April hearing.
The hospital expects to break ground in September and complete construction in 2016.
A coalition of nine elected officials have been pushing for approval since 2012.
Mount Sinai spokeswoman Shelly Felder said in a statement that they were “delighted” the project is moving forward.
The 235-bed primary care center on 30th Ave.
in Long Island City has seen an increase in visits in recent years, according to hospital figures provided to the state.
Between 2007 to 2011, emergency room visits have jumped by 6,000 more patients, or more than 13%.
In that same period, surgeries spiked by 1,459, with Mount Sinai staff conducting 5,144 procedures in 2011, data shows.
“The emergency room is overflowing,” said Rose Marie Poveromo, president of the United Community Civic Association.
” Under the current parameters, the expansion would add four more operating rooms and a new emergency department that would comprise 36 “treatment bays” and eight “observation beds,” according to the summary.
Queens Borough President Helen Marshall said the expansion is a vital lifeline for an area that has seen an influx of new residents in recent years.
“I have been a longtime advocate for Mt.
Sinai’s expansion in western Queens where it remains today the only hospital in an area that has seen a dramatic growth in housing and new residents,” Marshall said in a statement.

Henry Jolicoeur is a retired French Canadian hypnotherapist and a glass-products importer who enjoys making very low-budget documentary films.
In the summer of 2012, Jolicoeur read that Larry Ellison, a founder of the Silicon Valley giant Oracle and the fifth-richest man in the world, had bought 97 percent of the Hawaiian island of Lanai — not a 97 percent stake in some kind of company, but 97 percent of the physical place.
Jolicoeur was curious, so he booked a flight and packed his camera.
Jolicoeur knew a little about Lanai, having lived in Hawaii in the ’90s.
It is among the smallest and least trafficked of Hawaiian islands — a quiet, spectacular place where Cook Island pine trees vault up everywhere, like spires or giant peacock feathers — and can feel like a charming wormhole to an earlier era.
There is only one town, Lanai City, where virtually all of the island’s 3,200 residents live.
Ellison now owned a third of all their houses and apartments; the island’s two Four Seasons-run hotels; the central commons at the heart of Lanai City, called Dole Park, and all the buildings around it; the town swimming pool; the community center; the theater; a grocery store; two golf courses; a wastewater treatment plant; the water company; and a cemetery.
In a single sweeping real estate deal, reported to cost $300 million, he had acquired 87,000 of the island’s 90,000 acres.
And he would subsequently buy an airline that connects Lanai to Honolulu as well.
On all of Lanai, I heard of only a handful of businesses — the gas station, the rental-car company, two banks, a credit union and a cafe called Coffee Works — that are neither owned by Ellison nor pay him rent.
Jolicoeur spent about three weeks strolling around the island, asking locals to hold his ungainly, foam-sheathed microphone and tell the camera how they felt about the big acquisition.
Everyone seemed to feel very, very good.
Ellison,” one fishing-boat captain says.
“He’s got a vision, and he’s taking care of us over here on Lanai.
” A pack of landscapers, shown assiduously raking dirt, say things like: “Thank you for work, Mr.
” The owner of a salon: “I just want to take this time to thank Mr.
Ellison for the unbelievable, incredible takeover of Lanai.
” Inside the island’s Catholic church, a priest in a purple robe, surrounded by children, says: “Heavenly father.
We ask for your blessings for Mr.
Ellison, particularly, and those who work with him, that all the good plans and intentions that he has for Lanai be fruitful.
” Elsewhere, a woman shouts a little breathlessly: “Mr.
I’ve never met you before and really would like to, and I can imagine that you will do awesome wonders for this place.
” Jolicoeur is still working on his film but has posted some footage on YouTube in the meantime.
From time to time, he makes an appearance himself, pontificating about the bewildering new relationship between Ellison and everyone else.
Introducing one segment, Jolicoeur announces, “The great philosopher Plato said, 2,500 years ago, that rulers of man must be philosophers.
” A title card reads, “ORACLE = A person who delivers authoritative, wise or highly regarded and influential pronouncements.
” Ninety seven percent of Lanai may be a lot of Lanai, but it’s a tiny part of Ellison’s overall empire.
Ellison, who stepped down as C.
18, is estimated to be worth $46 billion.
4 million last year, or about $38,000 an hour.
He owns a tremendous amount of stuff — cars, boats, real estate, Japanese antiquities, the BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament, an America’s Cup sailing team, one of Bono’s guitars — and has a reputation for intensity and excess.
Recently, The Wall Street Journal reported that when Ellison has played basketball on the courts on his yachts, he has positioned “someone in a powerboat following the yacht to retrieve balls that go overboard.
” One biographer called him “a modern-day Genghis Khan.
” At a public meeting on Lanai last year, an Ellison representative explained that his boss wasn’t drawn to the island by the potential for profits but by the potential for a great accomplishment — the satisfaction one day of having made the place work.
For Ellison, it seemed, Lanai was less like an investment than like a classic car, up on blocks in the middle of the Pacific, that he had become obsessed with restoring.
He wants to transform it into a premier tourist destination and what he has called “the first economically viable, 100 percent green community”: an innovative, self-sufficient dreamscape of renewable energy, electric cars and sustainable agriculture.
Ellison has explained that Lanai feels to him like “this really cool 21st-century engineering project” — and so far, his approach, which seems steeped in the ethos of Silicon Valley, has boiled down to rooting out the many inefficiencies of daily life on Lanai and replacing them with a single, elegantly designed system.
It’s the sort of sweeping challenge that engineering types get giddy over: a full-scale model.
Of course, there are actual people living inside Ellison’s engineering project — a community being hit by an unimaginable wave of wealth.
But unlike all the more familiar versions of that story, Lanai isn’t being remade by some vague socioeconomic energy you can only gesture at with words like “techies” or “hipsters” or “Wall Street” but by one guy, whose name everyone knows, in a room somewhere, whiteboarding out the whole project.
Jolicoeur seemed to understand the precariousness that power imbalance created: the staggering responsibility, the incomprehensible control.
At one point, standing on a beach, he announces theatrically to the camera, “The Bible says, ‘Where there is no vision, people perish.
’ ” Eventually he visits the island’s animal-rescue center, where a young employee explains that because there are no natural predators on Lanai, the feral-cat population just explodes.
Right now, she tells him, the shelter is housing 380 cats.
From behind the camera, Jolicoeur hollers: “So basically, these are 380 cats of Mr.
” the woman says, laughing and laughing.
Next we see a half-dozen cats, occupying different areas of a multitiered bungalow-style dollhouse for cats, licking themselves and lapping water and napping.
More cats appear as Jolicoeur enters the shot, holding his long microphone, extending his free hand to stroke whichever cat looks most cooperative.
He looks thrilled with his wonderful discovery: He has reached an unanticipated edge of the island’s new reality.
Clasping an animal with a meaty palm, he turns back to the camera and says, “Mr.
Ellison, do you know that you have, now, 380 cats.
” For thousands of years, Lanai was ruled by the god of nightmares.
No humans lived there until, according to Hawaiian legend, a teenage chief from Maui was banished to the island for bad behavior.
The chief killed the nightmare god and routed his army of spirits.
People on Maui, eight miles to the east, saw the fire.
It was a signal — an all-clear.
They got in their canoes and came over.
Hawaiians lived happily on Lanai for about 800 years.
Then the Mormons started arriving, eventually led in 1861 by Walter Murray Gibson, who, in retrospect, may have been only a megalomaniac con man masquerading as a Mormon.
An article published by the Hawaiian Historical Society in 1960 describes Gibson as “ambitious and romantic and interested in ruling a tropical government.
” Gibson spent his early years tramping through Southeast Asia, stoking a native revolt against the Dutch in the hope of commandeering one.
He converted to Mormonism only one year before showing up on Lanai.
After building a Mormon colony in the island’s interior, Gibson began buying land on Lanai until he controlled nearly the entire island.
He paid for the land with the church’s money but put the titles in his own name.
When the Mormons figured this out, they excommunicated him.
Gibson retained the land, though.
By the time he died in 1888, it had passed to his daughter, then through a few other owners as a single holding.
None of them could figure out what to do with Lanai.
One crop that grew well was pineapples, and this caught the attention of James Drummond Dole, a Harvard Business School grad with a fledgling pineapple company on Oahu.
1 million for the land Gibson and his successors had accumulated.
Just like that, The New York Times reported, “an entire island, Lanai, has been taken over by a pineapple company.
” Dole plowed the interior into fields, built a harbor and roads and laid out an idyllic town near the center of Lanai — a grid of plantation-style cottages, with Dole Park in the middle — to house his mostly Japanese and Filipino workers.
By 1930, Lanai City had 3,000 residents, nearly all of them Dole employees, and the island was exporting 65,000 tons of pineapples a year.
The company sent landscaping crews to weed and mow workers’ lawns.
It ran an athletics program and built a golf course.
Life on Lanai was good; Dole insisted it should be.
His motto was: “Have happy workers, grow better pineapples.
” For 70 years, Lanai was among the world’s largest pineapple plantations.
Then in 1992, the island harvested its last crop.
Overseas production had driven down prices, and Lanai was left behind.
By that point, the island had changed hands two more times.
It was now controlled by the California billionaire David Murdock, who acquired the company Castle & Cooke, which took over Dole Foods’ holdings on Lanai in the ’60s.
Murdock was a somewhat imperial presence on Lanai.
He referred to residents as his “children.
” As the pineapple era wound down, Murdock pivoted Lanai’s economy toward tourism.
He built two resorts — the first developments on the island besides Lanai City and still the only major ones — and eventually contracted the Four Seasons to run them.
Pineapple pickers were retrained as hotel staff and landscapers.
Lanai was still a company town; the company just did something different now.
The transition did not go well.
Murdock had to steadily infuse the island with money — as much as $20 million or $30 million a year, he’d later report.
By the mid-2000s, he started cutting back.
He laid off large numbers of workers and began abandoning some of his quasi-governmental responsibilities as the island’s majority landowner.
The Chamber of Commerce disbanded.
As one resident put it, “Economically, there was real potential that we might dry up and blow away.
” Eventually, Murdock proposed a way forward: He would build an array of 45-story wind turbines on 20 square miles of the island and sell the electricity they produced to Oahu.
It would be a mammoth development on an insistently small-scale island.
Lanai had been settled by disparate immigrants who had to figure out how to get along, and that history, locals told me, keeps people from dwelling on divisions and differences.
(“That’s what makes the place so special,” one woman explained.
”) But the long fight over what the locals called Big Wind was brutal and divisive.
Family members stopped talking to one another.
There were protests in the street.
Many people who supported the wind turbines saw the protesters as reckless idealists; they were handcuffing the man the community relied on and driving the island into the ground.
Murdock seemed to feel the same way.
By the summer of 2011, he confessed to the editor of the island’s newspaper that Lanai had been “the poorest financial investment I’ve made in my entire life.
One was to “close it all down and leave.
” Instead, he put Lanai up for sale.
The island rippled with anxiety.
People worried that Murdock might sell off parts of Lanai to multiple owners, tossing the community into some uncharted, joint-custody arrangement.
Or that he’d sell to a big resort developer who would shatter the character of the place.
“Oh, my God, he could sell to a Russian oligarch,” one woman remembered thinking.
Another said, “We were praying it wasn’t some sheikh.
It was easy to be hopeful, and the civil war over Big Wind had left people scarred and exhausted with fighting.
Now Ellison wanted to revive the island, and he had the money to fund his dreams until they came true.
But was he a utopian businessman like Dole.
Or a slippery autocrat like Gibson.
Was he the nightmare god — or the renegade chief who finally came to vanquish him.
One morning, nearly two years later, at the Blue Ginger Cafe, I asked Pat Reilly, a 74-year-old regular with a thin white mustache and oversize glasses who has lived on Lanai for more than 30 years, how he felt when he heard that Ellison bought the island.
Reilly reached over his coffee mug and drew a big, slow question mark in the air, then jabbed his index finger at me to dot the question mark, hard.
“And it’s still that way,” he said.
Like a lot of omnipotent forces, Ellison has remained mostly invisible.
He has visited Lanai many times — locals told me they can tell he’s on the island when they see his yacht hitched in the harbor — but he seems determined to keep a formal distance from the community, shielding himself behind the executive team of Pulama Lanai, the management company he set up to oversee the island’s transformation.
Although Pulama holds frequent public meetings on Lanai, Ellison has declined to attend any or to address residents directly.
Several residents told me that they’d resorted to reading biographies of Ellison to learn more about the man — books that have somewhat disquieting titles like “Everyone Else Must Fail” and “The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison,” the punch line being: “God doesn’t think he’s Larry Ellison.
” Ellison’s vision for the island was first delivered, by proxy, early last year, at a meeting of the island’s Community Plan Advisory Committee.
These meetings were part of a county-government process to update the island’s comprehensive planning document, which dictates everything from zoning and land use to cultural preservation.
Butch Gima, a Lanai native and social worker who was chairman of the committee, told me that Ellison’s takeover put them in a tricky position.
On one hand, it allowed for greater ambition.
(“A new world has opened up,” one member told the committee.
) But it also felt strange to chart a course for an island that someone else had taken control of.
Even the committee’s economic research and growth projections might now be obsolete, depending on what Ellison wanted to do.
And so they invited Pulama’s new chief operating officer, Kurt Matsumoto, to brief them.
Matsumoto was hired to oversee operations on Lanai a couple of months earlier.
He had a background in running large resorts, but he was also a “Lanai Boy,” as people kept putting it to me — he grew up on the island.
“He doesn’t come off as being real slick,” Gima told me.
(As kids, Gima and Matsumoto were in Boy Scouts together.
) His appointment was encouraging; the relationship between the island and its new owner had been brought down to a more human scale.
Matsumoto appeared before the committee in mid-January — a middle-management Moses coming down the mountain with an important PowerPoint.
He prefaced his presentation by explaining that Ellison didn’t have any firm plans yet, only “intentions.
” Then he put up his first slide.
That night, and in other meetings, Matsumoto unveiled a startlingly ambitious vision for the island.
He explained that Ellison aimed to build a third resort, this time on the uninhabited southwestern coast, as well as a complex of private estates — maybe 50 of them, each five or more acres.
Ellison intended to expand Lanai’s airport, adding a bigger runway to accommodate direct flights from the mainland for the first time.
The limiting factor on Lanai has always been water, but Ellison would build a state-of-the-art desalination plant to produce more fresh water.
Ellison would expand Lanai City; build an “energy park,” where electricity produced with solar panels or photosynthesizing algae would be fed into a new smart grid; and bring commercial agriculture back to the island, in fields outfitted with sensors to control fertilization and irrigation, so that Lanai could begin to feed itself and even export products, rather than depend on weekly food barges from Oahu.
Eventually Matsumoto would tell The Wall Street Journal that Ellison hoped to see the island’s population double to about 6,000.
Elsewhere, there was talk of organic wineries and flower farms and an innovative aquaponics-and-hydroponics operation that would raise fish and fruits and vegetables in a sustainable symphony of positive feedback loops.
An institute for the study of sustainability.
A top-flight, residential tennis academy for competitive youth.
Matsumoto’s tone at that first meeting was low-key, humble and inclusive.
He used words like “respect” and “empower,” “sharing” and “investing.
” Then, eventually, he hit his last slide: “Mahalo” — Hawaiian for “Thank you” — and was done.
“It was hard to formulate any thought-out questions,” Gima recalled about the presentation.
“I think people just went, ‘Whoa.
’ ” By the time I visited Lanai last March, there was almost too much happening for one person to keep track of.
Pulama had gone to work around the island on long-deferred maintenance, renovations and full-bore beautification.
They’d painted the shops around Dole Park, ripped out old hedges and thinned or chopped down trees to air out the ambience.
Herds of construction workers moved around Lanai in fluorescent green or orange shirts, then gathered outside Richard’s Market at quitting time for drinks and snacks.
“He is renewing, refreshing, rejuvenating every part of the island,” said a woman named Mimi Evangelista.
“I feel blessed, blessed beyond my wildest dreams.
” After several years of terrible unemployment, people on Lanai were back to work.
Within four months of Ellison’s purchase, unemployment shot down to 1.
There were new faces everywhere, new luxury cars on the road and lines of new Mercedes vans and Nissan Leafs parked in the company’s lot near the center of town.
Pulama had started a summer program for kids and another program to help high-school students pursue college scholarships, screened “Frozen” in the park and held an “animal-care day” so people could get their cats dewormed free.
They’d opened a Nobu restaurant at one hotel.
I saw posters advertising free water-aerobics classes at the new community pool.
There were ukulele lessons and Pilates.
A month earlier, at an Oracle event in Las Vegas to unveil the company’s new cloud software, someone asked Ellison about Lanai, and he pointed out that “for the first time, Lanai has a football field where the high school can have home games.
” He also noted, “We’re empowering the locals to start their own businesses,” whether it’s “in agriculture or a juice bar in Lanai City.
” The juice bar occupies a cabana-like building at one corner of Dole Park and is owned and operated by Tammy Ringbauer, an effusive woman with bright flowers tattooed up her right arm.
Ringbauer is deep into juicing — I never saw anyone juice a turmeric root before — and charges 12 bucks for a large.
Ringbauer told me she moved to Lanai from Maui just weeks before the change in ownership, and this storefront caught her eye immediately.
It was the only vacant commercial space in Lanai City, though she had heard that, for some reason, Pulama Lanai kept rejecting entrepreneurs who wanted to lease it.
(Pulama says that it did not turn down any previous applicants.
) When I asked Ringbauer why the company finally gave the lease to her, she hesitated.
“I don’t want to say anything wrong,” she said.
“Because of the changes that are happening, there’s sort of a model we’re trying to move in the direction of.
And I think certain businesses may not fit into that model.
” She thought her vision was aligned with Pulama’s: She was using locally grown, organic produce and compostable to-go cups.
“I’m explaining the benefits of juicing, I’m educating,” she said.
Later, I heard that Ellison himself had come in for a juice a couple of times, sitting on a stool and sipping away like a regular person.
I couldn’t find any other small businesses that had started up on Lanai since Ellison’s purchase.
But there were stories about entrepreneurs, like the owners of the island’s wood shop, who had approached Pulama for leases or partnerships only to be offered a job with the company instead — which was good but allowed Pulama to preserve its hold on the economy.
“If we all work together,” she said, “we’re going to thrive.
” The wooden sign hanging behind her register read: “No whining.
Only hugs, smiles and warm feelings are allowed.
” Despite my many phone calls and emails to Pulama Lanai’s office, requesting interviews with its senior staff members, the company basically wanted nothing to do with me.
A couple of walk-in visits to the office, and to the standoffish man named Roger who worked the reception desk there, also got me nowhere.
(One time, trying to at least make small talk with Roger before he turned me away, I said, “It’s beautiful, what you’ve done here,” by which I meant the renovated office lobby, with its marble floors and Pier 1-esque furnishings and the carved, hardwood box where locals drop their rent checks.
“Yes, it is,” Roger replied, barely looking up from his computer.
) Eventually a public-relations contractor based in Honolulu told me that “the company is still in the planning phase” and would not be participating in this article.
Another obstacle: Roughly half of the adults on the island are employed by Pulama Lanai or its hotels, and nearly everyone else, it seems, has a sister or uncle who is — or else relies on the company indirectly for a livelihood or lives in a house that Pulama Lanai owns.
Lots of people told me that they were instructed not to talk to reporters or that they just didn’t want to risk upsetting the company.
One young man delivered a long, seemingly rehearsed preamble, insisting that he absolutely had to remain anonymous and that any opinions he expressed were his alone and did not reflect the views of either Pulama Lanai or his employer, which did business with Pulama and which I also shouldn’t name.
I expected something inflammatory, but his opinion was this: “There’s a lot of complainers — some people aren’t happy — but they don’t realize how much they have.
As it turns out, my perception of Pulama Lanai — as a vast, mostly incommunicative force — was pretty close to that of many residents I was meeting.
They didn’t necessarily understand how that force operated either, but they saw its handiwork everywhere.
And some of it didn’t feel awesome at all.
For starters, Pulama had inadvertently intensified a housing shortage on Lanai.
There was so much work that contractors had to be shuttled in daily or weekly from other islands or relocated.
A few off-island construction companies bought up housing in Lanai City in anticipation of winning contracts from Pulama, and the island’s independent landlords found they could demand higher rents from the remaining workers.
Though the company was busily fixing up cottages to rent out, many displaced locals wound up on Pulama’s indeterminably long waiting list for housing, which they believed Pulama employees were bypassing.
The process didn’t feel transparent or fair, and Pulama was resisting calls for a town-hall meeting about the issue.
(Later, I attended one of the company’s informational meetings about renovations at the Four Seasons — “We’re adding two new teppanyaki stations,” a Pulama representative explained — and watched residents try to derail its narrow agenda.
“It’s something you folks never even anticipated.
He was leaning on his walker, raising his voice.
”) By now, there was growing awareness that Pulama’s rhetoric of openness and collaboration didn’t always match its actions.
Some people wondered whether the company was hiding its real agenda behind a veneer of egalitarianism and good manners.
As a schoolteacher named Karen de Brum put it: “At the end of the day, Mr.
Ellison can and will do what he wants.
He asks for input, but that’s like me asking for input on what to do with my backyard.
” A 27-year-old Lanai native named Zane de la Cruz told me that he was “starting to think that communication is actually worse” than under the previous owner, “because there’s a false sense of good communication.
” He elaborated: “They give out a lot worthless information.
” At one meeting, a Pulama executive, Arlan Chun, was asked how much residents would pay for water from the new desalination plant and how Ellison expected to recoup his costs.
Chun suggested that Ellison wasn’t concerned with costs.
“The mandate we have is to move the island forward,” he said.
De la Cruz told me: “Well, yeah, that’s a fun and fancy thing to say, but someone is going to need to pay for this.
And if Larry Ellison decides, five years from now, that he doesn’t want to play this game anymore, we’ll be paying for it then.
” John Ornellas, chairman of the island’s planning commission, said he was struggling to get a straight answer about what would happen if Ellison dies.
(“He does do a lot adventurous things,” Ornellas noted; for example, there’s a rumor — the truth of which remains murky — that Ellison once flew a fighter jet under the Golden Gate Bridge.
) And Diana Shaw, who directs the Lanai Community Health Center, one of two medical providers on the island, said that Pulama ignored her requests for an introductory meeting for months.
“They kept talking publicly about the health care system and how they were going to improve it and enhance it and change it,” Shaw said.
“But nobody came and talked to us.
We are the health care system — at least 50 percent of it.
” Finally Pulama reps sat down with her.
Shaw described one executive as “the master of spin.
” At a small gathering one night, over pizza and beer, a retired school principal, Pierce Myers, explained it to me this way: “The hope is real.
” And yet lots of residents can’t help seeing everything Ellison does through a scrim of “suspicion and uncertainty.
” He went on: “This place was developed on the backs of humble people; people who cared for each other.
When you live on an island, you can’t afford to make enemies.
Now it feels like everything’s being driven from outside by some force that is not part of that tradition.
” Eventually the man sitting next to Myers spoke up.
“Any changes are going to be uncomfortable, but the changes are happening so fast,” he said quietly.
His name was Anthony Kaauamo Pacheco.
He is 29 and was born on Lanai but left to study filmmaking on Oahu.
Two years ago, he came back to the island.
He wanted to inspire would-be filmmakers there to tell their own stories; he even imagined drawing Hollywood productions to Lanai.
But there wasn’t an obvious way to start.
For the last two years, he’d been teaching film at the school, unpaid.
That afternoon, as a critical exercise, Pacheco had shown his students a promotional video produced by Love Lanai, a new branding campaign that Pulama was using to pitch the island to affluent tourists.
Love Lanai is the brainchild of a Southern Californian “approachable luxury” brand consultant named Audrey Cavenecia.
(Cavenecia has previously worked as a personal “life redesigner” and developed a reality show for E.
, “The Apology Concierge,” which curates “high-end apologies” — like for wealthy people who cheat on their wives.
) The video showed swirling aerial footage of the island’s beaches and cliffs, a man on a windy ridge getting down on one knee to propose and a woman on horseback rising from her saddle slightly, feeling free.
It had been posted to YouTube with the caption: “For Love Lanai, compassionate luxury is more than just a phrase, it’s an action of purpose,” which doesn’t really make sense.
In an interview that Pachecho found online and showed to his students, Cavenecia explained that she created Love Lanai to tell the stories of everyday Lanaians as their lives, under Ellison, improved.
It was the kind of work Pacheco had come home to encourage.
But for a branding consultant to tell those stories, as promotional material for high-end tourists, felt a little exploitative.
“I’m not a spectacle,” he said.
He seemed to be having trouble sorting out his feelings — deciding whether his skepticism was warranted or just reflexive.
Most of the island was private property when Pacheco was growing up too, but Murdock left a smaller footprint, tending to focus mainly on his hotels.
“It never felt like I was trespassing,” Pacheco said.
He said he wasn’t sure he wanted to live on Lanai anymore.
Then, two weeks later, in the middle of April, Pacheco’s situation improved.
Pulama Lanai funded his teaching position as part of its commitment to improve education.
He had a way to support his family now and resources to start the idealistic work he’d come back to Lanai to do.
He’d also signed a nondisclosure agreement with the company and couldn’t talk to me anymore.
Different people told different stories, but for a local named Gail Allen, the first sign that things had started to go wrong this summer came when Pulama Lanai inexplicably abandoned its renovation of the golf course behind her house, and the weeds and thistles grew waist-high and thick as a broom head, and the fish in the ponds died, and their bodies were left to knock around the algae-clouded edges of the water, floating on their sides.
The course, which is attached to the smaller of the two Four Seasons hotels and abuts Allen’s neighborhood on the hillside above Lanai City, had been slated for renovation at the beginning of the year.
Pulama ripped out the turf and irrigation systems, but little else happened after that.
Finally in May, the Jack Nicklaus design-company employee who had been relocated with his family to Lanai to oversee the redesign was abruptly sent home.
He told neighbors that the golf-course renovation had been put off until 2015 or 2016.
By then, mosquitoes were breeding on the course.
The ponds’ stench blew through peoples’ homes.
“It smells like a sewer up here,” Allen told me in early July when I called for an update.
Allen owns a gift shop in town and looks a little like Meryl Streep when she smiles.
When we met on her patio back in March, she was adamantly optimistic; she went on and on, telling me “I feel like I’m living in a utopia.
” and claiming to have inside information that Ellison was outfitting Lanai with 4G cellular service.
It wasn’t just the golf course; there were other signs of Pulama Lanai’s incompetence, or maybe just its insensitivity — it was tough to tell which.
Ellison’s trying to hurt people,” she told me on the phone, “but I don’t think he realizes what a delicate little ecosystem the economy is here.
We were so zealous: ‘Oh, my God, he’s coming to save our island.
’ It just feels like everything’s in limbo now.
All of a sudden, there’s a fear factor: ‘What are we going to do if this thing falls apart.
’ ” I flew back to Lanai a few days later.
A lot had gone subtly sideways since my first visit, as the company transitioned from the easy work of sprucing up the island to rolling out its reimagined version.
A central problem seemed to be that Pulama underestimated the difficulties that came with building on Lanai, where materials and labor have to be brought in.
In May, with work on the island consuming more and more resources, Philip Simon — an accountant, and president of another of Ellison’s companies, Lawrence Investments — was called in to consult with Pulama executives.
At public meetings, Pulama was now explaining that it had given up on the second airport runway and was also downshifting the $27 million makeover of the existing Four Seasons at Manele Bay too: The company would renovate only half the resort this year and was scrambling to finish in time for a large booking in October.
(Around town, the event was rumored to be a giant party for Ellison’s daughter, Megan.
) There were now 360 contractors on the job, many of them living at the hotel and in half of the other Four Seasons as well.
Just before I arrived, Ellison bought the small Hotel Lanai at the top of Dole Park — the last hotel on the island — and was filling it with workers every Monday through Friday, too.
Ornellas, head of the Lanai Planning Commission, told me that lately the gist of his conversations with company executives was: “The infrastructure can’t support their lofty goals.
” On such a small island, every adjustment Pulama made to its plans had repercussions, and the strain of disenfranchisement I encountered in the spring was spreading, as more stories of the company’s apparent carelessness or undependability surfaced.
Late last year, for example, Pulama told the owners of Trilogy Excursions — a large family-owned business based in Maui that, among other things, runs diving tours for hotel guests on Lanai and whose employees hand out a free turkey and a bag of rice to every family on the island at Thanksgiving — that in October, the Four Seasons would begin running its own dive operation.
Then this spring, Pulama recanted; they were delaying that plan.
This was good news for Trilogy, except that several of its employees, presuming they’d be out of work, had already taken other jobs, and the company was now short-staffed.
It’s possible that, internally, Ellison’s management team had reasonable explanations for what was being experienced as aloofness and disarray.
But down here, on Lanai, locals worried that the inscrutable engineer remaking their island was either turning away from his creation or — worse — incapable of manning all those knobs and switches as competently as they’d believed.
People’s lives were entangled in each decision; all the instability was upsetting their sense of the future.
“Pretty soon, it’s not going to be the Lanaian way of living here anymore,” Mike Lopez, Trilogy’s director of operations, told me one afternoon.
” Then, all of a sudden, he shot out: “See, this guy here.
” and gestured across the street, to a willowy man with a gray beard, in a ball cap and sunglasses, standing at the edge of Dole Park.
It was a new face that Lopez kept noticing around, always alone.
“I don’t know if they put people in to observe the atmosphere or what,” he said.
The man, who’d paused next to a garbage can, quickly walked away.
I’m not really equipped to judge whether a stranger on Lanai looks sinister or not.
But neither was Lopez anymore, and that was the point.
The week I returned, those feelings of suspicion on Lanai were coming to a head over what has been the most volatile political issue on the island for generations: water.
The planned desalination plant, already in its first phase of construction near the Four Seasons at Manele Bay, was a linchpin in Ellison’s vision; by converting up to 10 million gallons of salinated groundwater into fresh water a day, it would make more development and population growth possible.
Earlier this year, the company went to the Lanai Planning Commission for a 30-year special-use permit to operate the plant.
(The commission, made up of nine residents, is the one body of truly local government on Lanai.
Everything else on the island gets decided by the county government, on Maui, or the state, in Honolulu.
And it’s worth noting that while Ellison has declined to meet with Lanai residents, he hosted Alan Arakawa — the mayor of Maui County, which includes Lanai — for lunch on his yacht and held two big-ticket fund-raisers for Gov.
Neil Abercrombie before Abercrombie lost his primary in August.
) But after months of hearings, the Planning Commission rejected Pulama’s request and decided to issue a permit for 15 years instead.
The move may sound insignificant, but as Robin Kaye, a longtime resident, who helped lead the resistance to Murdock’s wind farm, pointed out, “This is the first time in two years, in a formal way, that any part of the community has said no to something Pulama has asked.
” And it provoked the first instance of outright intransigence the community had seen from Pulama.
During one of the final meetings about the plant in June, Kurt Matsumoto kept issuing the same ultimatum: Without a guarantee of 30 years of operation, he said, the company probably wouldn’t build the plant.
It just wouldn’t be worth the investment.
“It’s not a threat,” Matsumoto explained, adding later: “But we’re not here to negotiate that tonight.
” When I ran into Pat Reilly, the gentleman I met at the Blue Ginger Cafe in the spring, he broke down the altercation for me.
It was starting to feel as if Matsumoto and his team saw the local political process as an annoyance, he said.
They weren’t acting like elected officials, building public support for their agenda; they were acting like they owned the place — because they did.
“The local people want a say,” Reilly explained.
Psychologically, it makes all kinds of sense to me.
” By now, the standoff was taking on an ugly feel.
Many residents felt the commission had acted impetuously, handcuffing Ellison the same way activists sabotaged Murdock’s wind-farm proposal — even if, in this case, the commission wasn’t actually opposed to the plant and had, in fact, given the project a green light.
The commission, meanwhile, had just received a stern letter from Pulama’s attorney on Maui, laying out a complicated argument attacking a separate restriction written into the permit.
(The restriction stipulated that, once the plant was up and running, the hotel and surrounding homes could only draw water from the island’s main aquifer in emergencies, and only then for human consumption.
) One afternoon, I was waiting out a rain shower in one of Pulama’s Four Seasons, enjoying a very expensive ginger ale and some free popcorn, when I overheard a woman venting to the bartender about the commission’s audacity and underhandedness.
“This is a lot of money they’re playing with.
She grumbled about one former commissioner in particular, whom she saw as a ringleader, and huffed, “What was she thinking.
” She went on and got louder, until she’d finally talked herself out.
Thirty minutes later, I walked into a public meeting that Pulama was holding at the old union hall in town and saw the owner of a luxury home near the resort — a very large man in a polo shirt — standing over Pat Reilly, pointing and shouting: “Talk some sense into those people.
They want to shut off our water.
” I also saw the woman from the bar, smiling and offering people pastries and bottled water: it was Lynn McCrory, Pulama’s senior vice president of government affairs.
12, Pulama suddenly stopped construction at the desalination plant.
It was unclear when — or even if — it would restart.
“Sounds like the baby couldn’t get his way,” Ornellas, the head of the Planning Commission, told me.
“It’s sad it had to come to this.
” Before I’d ever been to Lanai, I watched a public-television interview online with a man named Kepa Maly, who was an authority on the island’s cultural history, and an unlikely one.
He wasn’t Hawaiian but a white man in a faded aloha shirt, with large, wire-frame glasses and a soft, breathy voice.
Even on the Internet, everything about him felt welcoming and also a little square.
He reminded me of a children’s folk singer from the ’70s.
Maly was born on Oahu, he explained to the interviewer.
As a child, he felt disconnected and lost, and eventually he was taken in by the Kaopuikis, one of Lanai’s oldest families.
Kaopuiki were born in the 1890s, 30 years before James Dole planted his first pineapple on Lanai, and they raised Maly the way they raised their 14 other children: speaking Hawaiian and steeped in the island’s history and traditions.
Maly was enthralled, and ever since he has dedicated his life to perpetuating traditional Hawaiian culture.
He was now executive director of the Lanai Culture and Heritage Center, a nonprofit museum at the top of Dole Park.
Kepa was the name the Kaopuikis gave him.
” I called Maly, but never heard back.
So one afternoon in March, I knocked on the door of the small blue house where I was told he worked.
I’d just started to introduce myself when the openness on his face collapsed into what seemed like embarrassment.
“I guess it was rude not to call you back.
” The thing was, he’d taken a job at Pulama Lanai.
He wanted to talk with me, but I needed to clear it with the company first.
After some phone calls, and another fruitless face-off with the impregnable Roger, the company surprised me: I would be allowed to interview Maly the next day.
“My experience with the previous owner was a challenging one,” he explained when we reconvened.
But all that difficulty went away when Ellison arrived.
Last year, Pulama hired him as its senior vice president of culture and historic preservation.
A crew was out that afternoon clearing the area around the religious center of ancient Lanai, and they’d soon be restoring ancient fish ponds and taro fields.
It was the sort of stewardship he’d continually asked the island’s previous ownership to support.
“Now, all the things we were talking about, but really struggling on, we are out in the field doing,” he said.
Maly had not yet met Ellison, but he believed that Ellison understood that investing in the preservation of Lanai’s culture and history is, at the very least, good business.
Today’s tourists, especially wealthy ones, value more than beaches and mai tais.
’ People want real experiences,” he said.
I’d heard the same explanation that morning from Tom Roelens, the manager of the Four Seasons at Manele Bay.
Roelens led me through a newly renovated room, noting all the local touches, like the wall panel illustrating the story of the demigod Maui and the canoe paddle over the toilet.
(“It’s just a stunning room product,” Roelens beamed.
”) Often, he said, resorts insulate guests from the community.
But on Lanai, the owner of the resort wasn’t in competition with the surroundings; he owned most of those, too.
“Lanai is this entire experience,” Roelens said.
And the people of Lanai are part of that experience, as well.
Nearly a quarter of the island works at the two hotels, he explained, and the company believes improving residents’ quality of life will “truly translate to the guest experience.
” Ellison had once articulated this philosophy himself: “We think, If we do a good job taking care of the locals, the locals will do a good job taking care of our visitors.
” It sounded like the same Silicon Valley philosophy that spawned all the epicurean cafeterias, yoga classes and nap pods on tech-company campuses — amenities designed to keep engineers happy and maximize their productivity.
But now, in his office, Kepa Maly reminded me that it was a much older model too, and one that Lanai had fared pretty well under.
“It’s just like Dole said,” he said.
“Have happy workers, grow better pineapples.
” I asked Maly if he had doubts about going to work for Pulama.
“And I have to tell you, sometimes I question my ability to be a good assessor of people’s integrity.
” But he pressed company executives, and they assured him that they were committed to protecting the island’s cultural resources.
“I have to believe that,” he told me.
” He explained that, when he was a newcomer to Lanai, people could have viewed him with the same mistrust some felt toward Ellison.
“I was blessed that some of the oldest families on Lanai took aloha for me, and taught me their language and shared their histories.
It gave me my whole life,” Maly said.
“I realize that we can always be cynical, and question motives,” he added.
“But it’s also just a junk way to live.
” He wanted to show me something: There are three words printed on Pulama’s business cards: “Preservation.
” His work — preservation — is one of those words.
“It’s the first one,” he noted.
He said it with conviction, as if he were lucky enough to live in some unspoiled world where the slogan on a corporation’s business cards reflected its genuine values.
Seems like Cirque du Soleil can turn just about anything into a mesmerizing performance -- even drones.
A new collaboration between Cirque du Soleil, ETH Zurich and Verity Studios features 10 quadcopters carrying out the kinds of complex synchronized dance maneuvers we usually see from the circus' famed acrobats.
But what makes this clip amazing is the one thing it doesn't feature: computer graphics.
You can see how the film was created in this "making of" video.
Verity co-founder Markus Waibel told Gizmag that each of the 10 drones was given a different personality, and that the entire film was shot in just three days.
"The collaboration resulted in a unique, interactive choreography where humans and drones move in sync," Cirque du Soleil said in the description on YouTube.
"Precise computer control allows for a large performance and movement vocabulary of the quadcopters and opens the door to many more applications in the future.

You’ve just finished an awesome workout, and you’re feeling pumped.
You have plans with friends, so you move on to the locker room, hop in the shower, don your street clothes, and you are out the door thirty minutes later.
You fight traffic for an additional thirty minutes, and finally meet up with your friends.
Your window of opportunity has passed.
You did not get the post workout muscle supplements that you needed to enhance muscle growth.
Muscles are in a constant state or activity.
They are either breaking down, or building up, and what you are doing and consuming determines which process is going on at all times.
Simply put, if muscle protein synthesis is not taking place, the muscles are breaking down.
This is where high protein muscle building supplements can come in handy.
If consumed immediately after a workout – within sixty minutes – you will be amazed at the benefits of these muscle supplements.
When you are training with weights, there is an increase of amino acids and glucose through the muscles.
This uptake continues for approximately sixty minutes after you stop working those muscles.
By injecting more protein into that process, you are essentially ensuring that your muscles are quickly getting a nice dose of protein right away.
By using a muscle supplement right after a workout, you will not only be greatly enhancing the effects of your workout, with almost immediate results, but you will also be speeding up the muscle healing process that always takes place after a workout.
The best muscle building supplement to use after your workout should be a high quality carbohydrate and protein mix.
Many bodybuilders get this carb/protein mix with the use of a shake – because it is quick and easy.
There are numerous high quality muscle supplement shakes on the market, and this is definitely an investment that you will want to make.
Furthermore, we know that liquids work through your system much faster than solids.
The muscle supplement shake that you choose should have 30 to 40 grams of protein, with 25 to 30 grams of carbs.
These can be purchased in liquid form, but it is generally cheaper to buy this in powder form, and mix it with water.
Water is just as important as the carbs and protein, because water is the vehicle that actually moves nutrients through the muscles.
The use of post workout muscle supplements is one of the best kept secrets in the bodybuilding world.
Those big muscles that you see are not due to steroids, as many people mistakenly assume.
They are due to understanding how the body works, and making sure that the process of muscle building is enhanced as much as possible, through your own actions.
Those bodybuilders who do take advantage of this sixty minute window of opportunity following a workout usually notice a vast difference within a few hours – not only in how they look, but also in how they feel.
Make sure that you include post workout muscle supplements to your regimen.

Today we're hopping the boat over to Catalina and checking out this converted church in Avalon.
The 1929 building was designed by Hollywood High grad Hans Wallner and modeled "after a chapel in Santa Croce, Italy.
" The current owner has converted it into a duplex--the top unit, in case you couldn't tell, is the former congregation space (we kind of love how the staging is doing nothing at all to tone down the churchiness), and can only be used as a vacation rental.
Last sold in 2010 for $563,000, the old church is now asking $1.

While the rest of us sad sacks have been sitting around watching our summer tans fade, the ever-busy folks at international architecture office Snøhetta have apparently been on an global roll, with an abundance of new projects making news in the past month alone.
Boasting everything from idyllic Norwegian lake cabins to massive performing arts centers in Ontario, the big-name firm should probably start handing out cheat sheets, just so that the rest of us can keep up.
Until then, here's a quick look at latest from the architects who never sleep: (↑ and ↓) Snug against the shore of the Norwegian island of Hudøy, this reconstructed boat house now offers overnight accommodations for visiting youth groups.
Clad in locally-sourced vertical timber slats, the walls give a semi-transparent peek into the two-floor interior space, which comes decorated with simple but colorful little bed chambers.

While a gondola sounds super great, scientists on the island are not happy with the plan.
The Conservancy owns about 88% of Catalina and is funded mostly through philanthropy, grants, and gift store sales.
Many say that it's been straying from its core mission of promoting conservation and education about the island (it's "a steward for at least 50 plant and animal species found nowhere else in the world," according to the LA Times), and that gondola money could be better used for something else.
While the Conservancy has doubled its staff over the last 10 years, it's only added two-thirds more biologists and its chief conservation and science officer resigned earlier this month.
The research center at Middle Ranch is getting old and, according to the LAT, "Annual surveys of birds and mammals were suspended indefinitely seven years ago to use those funds for other projects, such as bison management.

ALTAY, China — A university professor who has become the most visible symbol of peaceful resistance by ethnic Uighurs to Chinese policies was sentenced to life in prison on Tuesday after being found guilty of separatism by court officials in the western region of Xinjiang, which Uighurs consider their homeland.
The punishment handed down to Ilham Tohti was the harshest that Chinese officials have imposed on a political dissident in recent years.
Tohti was convicted after a two-day trial in Urumqi, the regional capital, that ended last Wednesday.
He was taken by the police last January from his home in Beijing, where he teaches economics at Minzu University, and brought to Xinjiang, where he was charged with separatism.
” he yelled as police officers dragged him from the courtroom, his lawyer, Li Fangping, said.
His wife Guzelnur, called Guzaili Nu’er in Chinese, who had not seen him in eight months until the trial started last week, wailed when the verdict was announced.
Tohti’s brothers supported her and led her back to a hotel.
Officials in Xinjiang are grappling with a surge in violence between the mostly Muslim, Turkic-speaking Uighurs and the Han, the dominant ethnic group in China.
Communist Party leaders have long said that Xinjiang is in a battle with the forces of terrorism, separatism and religious extremism, and that all steps must be taken to stamp out the insurgency.
But foreign scholars, diplomats and human rights advocates denounce China’s hard-line policies against the Uighurs, and say the harsh measures that China has taken against moderates like Mr.
Tohti will only lead to further radicalization of Uighurs and a rise in violence, including the kind encouraged by foreign jihadist groups.
Tohti, 44, was charged with organizing and leading a separatist group, Mr.
Li, the lawyer, said in a telephone interview.
As evidence, officials presented in court material representing Mr.
Tohti’s viewpoints on Uighur identity and China’s ethnic policies, much of it drawn from his classroom teachings and the website he ran from late 2005 to 2008, Uighur Online.
Tohti’s separatist group included seven of his students, who have also been detained and will almost certainly be tried, Mr.
Among prosecutors’ arguments was that Mr.
Tohti had “internationalized” the Uighur issue by giving interviews to foreign reporters and had translated foreign articles and essays about Xinjiang to be posted on Uighur Online.
“He showed great spirit in court,” Mr.
“He gave an eloquent defense to every accusation.
He maintained his innocence from the beginning to the end.
He gave a brilliant 90-minute defense speech at the end of the trial.
Li added: “I hate to think about his wife and two young sons.
They just had their entire life’s savings of 800,000 renminbi frozen,” an amount equal to $130,000.
How is she going to raise two children all by herself.
This family’s tragedy has only begun.
” The Chinese authorities had previously frozen Mr.
Tohti’s bank account, ostensibly to investigate the sources of the money.
On Tuesday, the court ordered the confiscation of all of his assets.
Tohti has two sons, ages 5 and 8, who live in Beijing with his wife.
In an emotional telephone interview on Monday night, Ms.
Guzelnur said she had not expected the charges to be so harsh and that she had yet to tell her sons about their father’s plight.
“I will tell them what happened when they grow up,” she said.
She added: “I’m not worried about my husband’s spirit.
He has heart problems and bad lungs.
“No matter what happens, I will wait for him to come home,” she said.
Tohti has a daughter from an earlier relationship, Jewher Ilham, who is attending Indiana University in Bloomington, where Mr.
Tohti was to have taken up a post as a visiting scholar before the Chinese police prevented him from boarding a plane with Ms.
The police intensified their scrutiny and harassment of Mr.
Tohti after a car crash in October 2013 that killed and injured tourists near Tiananmen Square; Chinese officials said the crash was the work of hostile Uighurs.
The police actions culminated in the detention of Mr.
For years, officials in Xinjiang had been intent on silencing Mr.
Tohti, despite the fact that he lived outside of the region, in Beijing, and the Xinjiang government appeared to have been given permission by the central authorities to make its move in 2013, Mr.
Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency, said in an English-language report Tuesday afternoon that the ruling declared Mr.
Tohti had “bewitched and coerced young ethnic students” into working on his website and that he had “built a criminal syndicate.
” Foreign governments have condemned China for its treatment of Mr.
Several Western nations tried sending diplomats to the trial, but they were turned away at the courthouse, which was heavily guarded by police officers, some carrying riot shields.
Foreign journalists were also barred from attending the trial.
“Professor Tohti has consistently supported human rights for China’s ethnic Uighur citizens,” a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Beijing said during the trial.
“His arrest silenced an important Uighur voice that peacefully promoted harmony and understanding among China’s ethnic groups, particularly Uighurs.
We stress the importance of Chinese authorities differentiating between peaceful dissent and violent extremism.
” The United States government has called on China to release Mr.
Tohti and the seven students who have been detained.
The PEN American Center, which campaigns for freedom of expression and gave Mr.
Tohti an award in March 2014, three months after he had been detained, released a statement Tuesday that said, “His conviction makes a mockery of China’s professed commitment to social harmony by silencing one of the country’s unifying voices and, with it, fellow Uighur writers who are now unlikely to dare speak out.
” Maya Wang, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, said she could not recall any ethnic Han advocates or dissidents receiving a life sentence in recent years.
But she said the authorities usually treat dissent by Uighurs much more harshly, especially following ethnic rioting in Urumqi in 2009 that resulted in the deaths of at least 200 people, most of them Han.
A Uighur radio journalist, Memetjan Abdulla, was sentenced to life in prison in 2010.
Wang noted that the indictment of Mr.
Tohti was consistent with a broad move in recent years by the Communist Party to silence advocates known for their “measured words and actions,” including Xu Zhiyong and Pu Zhiqiang, two well-known lawyers arrested for their political activities.
“These and Tohti’s harsh sentence are signs of just how far the authorities have gone in severely restricting the already limited civil liberties in China,” she said, “and that the situation might get even worse down the road.

BEIJING — A former top Chinese economic official accused of taking millions of dollars in bribes went on trial on Wednesday, the latest step in a case prompted by an investigative journalist amid a widening campaign against corruption.
Liu Tienan, 58, a former deputy chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, an economic planning agency, was charged with accepting bribes of 35.
8 million, together with his son, in exchange for granting favorable business contracts, according to a statement posted on the microblog of the Intermediate People’s Court in Langfang, Hebei Province.
Liu, who was expelled from the Communist Party last year, is one of the first senior officials felled under President Xi Jinping’s anticorruption campaign to have gone on trial.
The charges, which date back more than a decade, accuse him of accepting millions of dollars, company shares and a Nissan from businessmen.
He is also accused of allowing businessmen to give his son, Liu Decheng, bribes including a villa, a Porsche and $1.
2 million salary for a nonexistent job.
Prosecutors are seeking a life sentence for Liu Tienan; his son is to be tried separately.
The trial comes almost two years after a prominent journalist said online that Mr.
Liu had engaged in unscrupulous business deals.
The journalist, Luo Changping, also accused him of threatening to kill his mistress and exaggerating his academic credentials.
Luo, then the deputy editor of Caijing Magazine, wrote three posts on the Sina Weibo microblog platform detailing those accusations against Mr.
Liu, whose mistress had contacted the journalist.
Liu was also the head of the National Energy Administration.
He was stripped of that position in May 2013, the same month that Communist Party anticorruption agents announced that he was being investigated on suspicion of “grave violations of discipline.
Liu has not been charged in connection with the accusations about the death threat or his credentials.
But the bribery case gives the Chinese government yet another opportunity to show the public that it is committed to stamping out corruption.
Xi has vowed to go after both senior and junior officials, or “tigers and flies” as he has put it, who are guilty of graft and other forms of misconduct that threaten to undermine confidence in the party.
But even as the anticorruption campaign has brought down high-ranking officials once thought to be untouchable, such as China’s former security chief Zhou Yongkang, the authorities have been making it increasingly difficult for muckraking citizens to expose official wrongdoing.
In June, the government announced rules barring journalists from writing articles without their employers’ permission or setting up their own websites.
Last month, new regulations on social media platforms barred users with public accounts from posting or reposting news about politics or current affairs without government approval.
Luo, the journalist, refused to comment on the trial when reached by telephone on Wednesday.
Despite the publicity surrounding Mr.
Liu’s fall, many Chinese are skeptical that the anticorruption campaign is really about rooting out systemic abuses within the government.
Zhu Ruifeng, a Beijing blogger who has detailed more than 50 cases of suspected corruption, dismissed the trial as political showmanship.
The majority of the Chinese officials under investigation, Mr.
Zhu said, only end up in that situation because they made grievous political mistakes.
“Most times it’s just because they’re on the wrong team or they’re so exposed online that it can’t be covered up,” he said.
Zhu was doubtful that whistle-blowers would ever be truly empowered to stop corrupt officials.
“It only counts when certain government departments recognize official behavior as corruption,” he said.
“It’s not like we can report on whomever we want.
So essentially the prize of bringing someone in has to go to them.

At its meeting on Thursday, the West Hollywood Design Review Subcommittee will see a presentation about a residential building proposed for 826 N.
Kings Road between Waring and Willoughby.
Applicant Demetri Damos is proposing a 34-unit building with five affordable units.
In her design review memo to the subcommittee, WeHo urban designer Stephanie Reich praised the project renderings as showing “high design quality.
” “The project is a sophisticated 3-dimensional proposal that presents a strong design idea.
While taller than its neighbors, it provides sensitivity to mass and scale with attention to detail that is well-designed to its site.
The project appears to incorporate sustainability principles in a way that serves to enhance the building design.
With continued attention to detail, the project will serve to fit well into the context and enhance the overall streetscape and neighborhood,” Reichs said in the memo.
“It appears that there is an effort to provide as much live planting as possible in all setback areas and in the circulation space at the ground level … The approach to the landscape design appears to be very appealing, focused on complementing the building design and a high degree of sustainability.
Staff will review more detailed planting plans and work with the landscape designer as the project moves forward.
” Reich’s memo includes one crticism: that “there could be a greater sense of openness and transparency to the street, particularly at the ground level.
” The Design Review Subcommittee will meet at 5:30 p.
at the Plummer Park Community Center, 7377 Santa Monica Blvd.
A Pennsylvania press conference against LGBT hate crimes on Tuesday turned personal when a state senator announced he is gay.
Jim Ferlo said, according to audio posted by Mary Wilson of WITF broadcasting.
Wilson noted in her tweets during the event that Ferlo is likely Pennsylvania's first openly gay state senator.
Ferlo, an outgoing senator who represents part of Pittsburgh, is the sponsor of a bill that would expand the state's hate crimes law to cover lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals.
The legislature's current push to amend the law was sparked by a Sept.
11 incident in which two gay men were allegedly beaten in Philadelphia.
At the microphone Tuesday, Ferlo said he's been "a practicing homosexual" since his mid-20s.
"I've never denied my homosexuality … I just never made an official declaration," he said, noting that many of his friends, co-workers and community members have known for years.
After Ferlo finished speaking, Rep.
Brian Sims (D) told other lawmakers, "Let's keep this going," according to Wilson's tweets.
The recent attack was in Sims' district, and he became Pennsylvania's first openly gay legislator to be elected when he won his seat in 2012.

Even if a deal is struck today on developing the Kingsbridge Armory into a $324-million shopping mall, the "living wage" dispute that threatened to derail it will continue to roil City Hall.
Under a bill introduced Wednesday in the City Council by Oliver Koppell (D-Bronx) and Annabel Palma (D-Bronx), developers and others who benefit from city subsidies for their property deals will have to pay a living wage for the ensuing jobs that are created.
The bill would accomplish by law what community activists and members of the Bronx Council delegation have been trying to impose - for the first time ever in the city - on the Related Companies, the city-chosen developer of the long-vacant Bronx armory.
Backers of the new bill say its passage would avoid future fights like the Kingsbridge Armory battle by making a living wage a citywide mandate rather than targeting one developer as a test case.
A living wage is defined as $10 an hour plus benefits or $11.
50 without benefits, as compared to the minimum wage of $7.
Those pushing for a living wage, as part of a community benefits agreement with the developer, argued Related was getting "a sweetheart deal" from the city - including $14 million in various tax breaks and exemptions, plus a bargain $5 million purchase price for the city-owned armory.
Such taxpayer-funded largesse should be conditioned on creating more than just marginal-income jobs in the state's poorest borough, according to Bronx officials.
But aides to Mayor Bloomberg and representatives of the Related Companies said a mandated living wage would kill the mall project because potential retail tenants would balk at paying salaries higher than regional competitors.
A possible resolution to the impasse was still being hammered out as of Thursday night between the Bronx delegation and mayoral officials, with consultations with the developer.
Council members are on call for a possible special session today to vote on zoning and other land-use actions required for the project.
The deadline for such approvals is Monday.

Last month, the British makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury visited the States to introduce her beauty line, which arrives here later this year, and proudly present her Filmstar Bronze & Glow product to a small group of beauty editors.
It’s a miracle-working compact designed to make the roundest of facest appear toned, and is filled with two kinds of powder: a darker one, which creates depth when brushed into the hollows of the cheeks, and a lighter, shimmery one, which makes the cheekbones rise and pop.
These nature-defying contouring and highlighting products have cropped up on beauty counters everywhere in recent months, like the Nars Contour Blush palettes, introduced back in March, and the MAC Maleficent Sculpting Powder, unveiled earlier this month as part of the brand’s new collection inspired by the Disney blockbuster of the same name, which stars Angelina Jolie and hits theaters this Friday.
It’s fitting that the makeup artist Toni G created the MAC capsule of beauty products — she has been doing Jolie’s makeup for about nine years now, including on set for “Maleficent.
” For her villainous character in the film, Jolie’s cheekbones were accentuated using tiny prosthetics applied by Rick Baker, but Toni G says that in real life, the actress doesn’t need any help enhancing them.
“They actually kind of just define themselves, so we concentrate on just, you know, her eyes and her lips – what color she’s going to wear – and a nice base.
” For the rest of us, Toni G explains how to achieve the look of architectural features with a few simple guidelines.
Break it down before you begin.
“I would start out with a base, and then I would add my highlights and then I would add the contour.
” Identify and highlight the under-the-eye triangle.
“If you took a pencil from your nose to your upper cheekbone, you would just take that ‘V’ from the corner of your eye to the nose and highlight that whole area under your eye.
That would help enhance your cheekbones – and with a light contour.
I like to work more with highlights than doing too much contour.
“For the contour, you feel where your cheekbone is, and you kind of go right under that – and don’t take it too far to your mouth.
I would keep it, you know, just halfway from your ear to the midpart of your cheekbone.
Just don’t take it too far down; then it becomes obvious.
” Blend the contouring color up and away.
“If you’re using a cream, you blend it out with your sponge until there’s no hard lines — and then same with the powder, except you would use a brush.
From where you put it, blend it up.
“The thing with cheekbones is – I would say the more defined your eyes are, that the focus will be taken away.

Well, he already had the porno-sounding name.
Disgraced former pol Anthony Weiner stepped out to do some Black Friday shopping in SoHo sporting a moustache reminiscent of the one made infamous by adult-film legend John “Johnny Wadd” Holmes in the XXX-rated 1970s.
The randy Queens ex-rep — who was forced out after it was revealed that he’d sexted pictures of his Congress member to numerous women — toted a shopping bag as he and pregnant wife, Huma Abedin, hit the stores.
Abedin, who works for Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, expects to give birth around New Year’s Day.
Weiner pulled the plug on his once-promising career in June when he confessed to having had several online liaisons with other women.
Perhaps his new look is a sign that he has turned over a new fig leaf.
After all, the scandal revealed that he’s not a fan of hair anywhere on his body.
In his short life, Ousmane Coulibaly, a 19-year-old high school senior in Manhattan, has seen plenty of adversity.
He grew up poor in Mali, was estranged from his family at 13 and has lived on the street there and in New York.
An illegal immigrant, he is staying in a homeless shelter while he tries to graduate and obtain a special immigration status reserved for young people who have been abandoned or abused.
But now he is facing a different kind of challenge: an investigation by immigration authorities who have subpoenaed his school records, without explaining why.
The subpoena, which New York City school officials say is highly unusual here, has raised alarm among some immigration lawyers and civil libertarians who say they fear that the federal government is opening a new front in immigration enforcement, in a city where officials have staunchly defended immigrant rights.
Coulibaly’s lawyers, who have sued to quash the request, contend that the City Department of Education was prepared to release the files without resistance, even though the subpoena did not have the backing of a court order and could have been challenged.
Education officials say that their policy is to comply with all legally issued subpoenas and that they gave the student a chance to contest the one from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
A spokesman for the immigration agency said that it regularly asked schools around the country for student records, and that most were “completely cooperative.
” But the American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties Union said they had not heard of similar subpoenas from the agency.
“New York City must protect its immigrant students from having their education records turned over to immigration authorities without cause,” said Udi Ofer, advocacy director of the New York group, though he added that he was not familiar with the specifics of Mr.
The immigration agency sent the subpoena to education officials on July 21, seeking “any and all records relating to Ousmane Coulibaly’s contact information, dates of attendance and class schedules,” but gave no reason for the inquiry.
Two days later, a lawyer for the Education Department sent a letter to Mr.
Coulibaly, saying that it would hand over the files unless a court stopped their release.
“You may wish to consult with an attorney,” the department’s lawyer wrote.
The letter was also sent to Mr.
Coulibaly’s immigration lawyer.
Lauren Burke, a lawyer at a social services agency that has been helping Mr.
Coulibaly, hurriedly moved to block the subpoena, and Judge George B.
Daniels of United States District Court in Manhattan issued a temporary restraining order blocking release of the records pending a hearing, now scheduled for Sept.
Coulibaly’s lawyers contend, among other arguments, that the subpoena violates due process and equal protection rights that courts have accorded to students, regardless of immigration status, under the 14th Amendment.
The immigration agency, the lawyers say, appears to be on “a fishing expedition” into their client’s life.
Immigration officials would not discuss their investigation.
A spokeswoman for the Education Department, Natalie Ravitz, said in an e-mail that although the department regularly received subpoenas for student records, “no one can even remember the last time we received an ICE subpoena.
” The department must obey subpoenas, she wrote, pointing out that federal law permits schools to release student records without consent from the student or the student’s parents to comply with a judicial order or a lawfully issued subpoena.
But under federal law, she added, the department must inform the student — or the parents or legal guardians of a minor — “before we comply with a subpoena, precisely so they can decide whether to challenge the legality.
Ravitz would not say whether the department had intended to challenge the subpoena if Mr.
“Our job is to educate the students of N.
“We don’t ask students their immigration status, and it would not be appropriate for us to inject ourselves into this immigration matter.
Coulibaly admits he is not a legal immigrant.
He traveled to the United States on a tourist visa in 2007, when he was 16, and stayed beyond the visa’s expiration.
But he, his lawyers and education officials said they had no idea why immigration authorities had singled him out from perhaps thousands of illegal immigrants in New York schools.
Coulibaly said during an interview in the offices of the social services agency, the Door, which works with disadvantaged youths.
“If they want to see me, they can see me.
” A large, quiet man, he said he left home when he was 13 — under circumstances he would not discuss — and moved to Bamako, Mali’s capital, where he lived by his wits.
He found work as a live-in housekeeper for a Malian businessman, who helped him secure the visa and put him on a plane to New York, he said.
Coulibaly arrived at Kennedy International Airport speaking little English and knowing nobody.
A West African cabdriver took pity on him, he said, and drove him to an apartment in Harlem shared by several immigrants, where he was given a bed.
A neighbor helped him enroll in ninth grade at Liberty High School Academy for Newcomers, a public school in Manhattan that caters to immigrants.
Coulibaly joined the varsity basketball team and became the starting center.
He ended his sophomore season as the third-highest rebounder and the 19th-highest scorer in the city’s Public School Athletic League.
He was benched for much of the season his junior year while he improved his grades.
Meanwhile, he tried to support himself with work at a car wash and, later, as a pizza deliveryman.
He had to leave his $150-per-month bed in the Harlem apartment early this year after he fell behind on the rent.
Since then, he said, he has moved from shelter to shelter.
Before the subpoena appeared, his lawyer, Ms.
Burke, had been helping him prepare an application for the special immigration status for young people who are in the United States without their parents’ support.
Coulibaly are pushing forward with that case as they battle the subpoena.

Objectives: Recent findings of better health outcomes in older caregivers than noncaregivers suggest a healthy caregiver hypothesis (HCH) model may be more appropriate than the stress process model for evaluating the health effects of caregiving.
In a cross-sectional study, we tested the HCH on two cognitive domains: verbal memory and processing speed.
Method: Participants from the Caregiver Study of Osteoporotic Fractures who had a 2-year follow-up interview were categorized as continuous caregivers (n = 194), former caregivers (n = 148), or continuous noncaregivers (n = 574).
The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT; memory) and Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST; processing speed) were administered at the follow-up interview.
Results: Continuous caregivers had better memory performance and processing speed than continuous noncaregivers: adjusted mean scores for HVLT were 18.
Discussion: Results support the HCH model for cognitive outcomes in older women caregivers; however, the relationship may be domain specific.
Judges, not contestants, are really the stars of reality singing competitions.

In New York, as in cities across the country, gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, transsexuals, and their friends will be marching in support of tolerance and diversity.
It was in this spirit that my girlfriend and I attended Kings and Queens of New York City: A Drag Summit at the Bruno Walter Auditorium of the New York Public Library.
Besides the—in retrospect predictable—obstruction of our sightlines (see photo), it was an enjoyable and interesting afternoon.
Sadly, the summit took place against the backdrop of the recent beating of drag superstar Kevin Aviance as he left a club in the East Village.
As one of the panelists pointed out, this sort of thing happens all the time to members of the LGBT community; the only reason this incident made the news is because Aviance is famous.
Though the word “summit” connotes the lofty and unapproachable, the event was anything but that.
And in fact it allowed the daytime people in the audience an all too rare opportunity to come into contact with the human face of drag.
Jeffries of New York University, presented a slideshow on the history of drag from the ancient Greeks to the present (highlight: the governor of New York from 1702-1708, Lord Cornwall, was rumored to have dressed in drag), and then introduced the panelists.
The luminaries on the panel included the drag kings Stormé Delarverié, Murray Hill, and DIYAA, and the drag queens Flawless Sabrina, Sade Pendavis, and Taylor Mac.
The discussion was punctuated by performances by DIYAA, Taylor Mac, and, in what proved to be the highlight of the afternoon, a moving rendition of John Lennon’s “Imagine” by the powerfully-voiced diva Sade Pendavis.
The Chelsea Hotel connection is Stormé Delarverié, a husky 86-year-old former cross-dressing torch singer and one of the sweetest old ladies you’re ever likely to meet—though one you’d sure as hell better not cross.
In the lobby of the Chelsea before the summit, Debbie Martin spoke with her, explaining that our blog readers wanted to hear her story.
” Stormé exclaimed, “I chopped off my hair, put on men’s clothes, and joined the Jewel Box Review.
”The Jewel Box Review was a multi-racial drag revue that toured the country in the fifties, sixties and seventies.
The only female member of the troupe, Stormé served as stage manager, musical arranger, emcee and “mother” of the troupe for fourteen years.
“But you’re an important activist, too,” Debbie reminded her.
“Could you tell us about your role in the Stonewall rebellion.
” “They ask me, why do you want to be a target like that.
” Stormé said, referring to her leadership role in the gay rights struggle.
“They’ll stab you in the back, they’ll hit you, they’ll shoot you.
”She paused to reflect and then said, “But honey, they’re all dead, and I’m still here.
” All of the panelists had tales of struggle and violence--ironic and troubling in the lives of such gentle people--but they had overcome this adversity, in part, by transforming themselves.
DIYAA said she had chosen to wear men’s clothes because of the feeling of power they gave her.
As the teenage thugs were beating Kevin Aviance, one of the things they reportedly yelled at him was, “You’re not diesel.
”In the question and answer session of the summit, someone asked if anyone understood this remark.
All of the panelists on stage were mystified.
They were all a bit too old—as was I—to get the reference.
But a younger woman in the audience stood up to explain that what they were referring to was in fact the Diesel clothing brand.
They were saying, in effect, that Aviance wasn’t butch enough to wear the brand of clothing he was wearing at the time, a brand that for these young men signified a certain macho lifestyle.
And how ridiculous to be beaten because of a brand.
Even more so than a hate crime, this was a crime of ignorance and stupidity.
It’s tempting to say that these were just kids who didn’t know any better.
But am I the only one who notices a disturbing parallel between these young men’s defense of the integrity of a brand—a corporate brand that can take care of itself--and the conservatives renewed interest in banning same sex marriage via a constitutional amendment.
These teenagers didn’t come by their ideas in a vacuum.
Still, the fact that the Drag Summit took place at a public library is not insignificant.
Outside of the ignorant and backward, and the politicians who seek to exploit these people, drag and homosexuality are becoming increasingly understood and accepted.
Nonconformity is rightly seen as something not to fear but to celebrate.
As Flawless Sabrina says, “If you’re not living an alternative life style these days, you’re in danger of becoming a mystery guest in your own life.

A terrible incident, which could be used as a script for a horror film, has recently occurred in the U.
Four white teens - two girls and two boys - killed two young black men to give the "sophisticated" girls an opportunity to experience the joy of sex with dead bodies.
One of the performers of the touching female dream was the son of a local police officer.
American reality today looks worse than darkest Hollywood movies.
Eighteen-year-old Alisa Massaro, whose passion is defined as "necrophiliac fetish," allegedly mentioned that she wanted to try sex with corpses.
This was promptly recalled by one of the would-be assassins, Joshua Miner.
He suggested they should try and bring the woman's fantasy to real life.
The woman initially refused, but changed her mind in a few days.
Miner's accomplice was Adam Landerman, 19, the son of a police officer.
The two teen boys decided to kill two black men.
To implement the idea, they wanted to lure victims into a trap with the help of a woman, Bethany McKee.
She was supposed to promise sex with white girls to the victims.
She did not lie: the black men, who followed her to their death, received what they wanted, although they were dead at that time.
As soon as two black friends - Eric Glover and Terrence Rankins - entered the house in an anticipation of fun, Miner and Landerman attacked them.
The victims were tied up and strangled.
After that, Alisa Massaro and Bethany McKee engaged in sexual activities with the corpses.
The parents of the victims were not particularly worried about their children for two days.
America is America: the police are looking for racist motives in the murder of two black men.
The photos of the murderers that were published in the media do not leave any doubt about the fact that they are the people with obvious signs of severe psychopathy.
Another very similar "good-looking" guy Adam Lanza shot kids at school a few months ago.
Something wrong has been happening in the U.
Children in schools are massively fed with a drug that has been used in psychiatric hospitals and is classified as amphetamine.
students take Ritalin and a similar drug, Dexedrine.
The drugs are used against the so-called hyper-activity.
It is very comfortable for teachers when children do not run about screaming and shouting.
They prefer them sitting down, staring ahead into nowhere and doing what teachers tell them to do.
Many experts have repeatedly pointed out the fact that these drugs, also called children's cocaine, lead to unprovoked violence and mass shootings in American schools.
government turns American students into pharmacological zombies, trying to take guns away from adults, referring to the crimes committed by young psychopaths.
To give you an idea of ​​the extent of such policies, we would like to note that the production of amphetamine-type drugs in the country has been growing exponentially.
In addition, Americans consume large quantities of chemical food, which is also a part of the pharmacological industry.
The agency, which directly deals with the issues of changes among the population, is called the Food and Drug Administration, which obviously means that food and drug is one and the same thing.
To crown it all, there are practically no mental health services provided to the population in America.
They have been replaced with ambulatory narcotization.
In 1955, there were 559,000 patients in state-funded psychiatric hospitals per 165 million people.
Nowadays, their number has dropped to less than 50,000 per 300 million people.
It is believed in America that about 20 percent of U.
prison inmates are mentally ill.
However, they will not be sent to "yellow houses", as they serve as a valuable labor resource in the American prison economy.
ZipRealty has released a new study on the most expensive zip codes in Los Angeles County.
Zip codes in Santa Monica, Pacific Palisades and San Marino are the most expensive as the first half of 2014 came to a close.

In an image taken from the Internet, a Syrian rebel with what appeared to be a Chinese-made FN-6 antiaircraft missile.
Syrian rebels, frustrated by the West’s reluctance to provide arms, have found a supplier in an unlikely source: Sudan, a country that has been under international arms embargoes and maintains close ties with a stalwart backer of the Syrian government, Iran.
In deals that have not been publicly acknowledged, Western officials and Syrian rebels say, Sudan’s government sold Sudanese- and Chinese-made arms to Qatar, which arranged delivery through Turkey to the rebels.
The shipments included antiaircraft missiles and newly manufactured small-arms cartridges, which were seen on the battlefield in Syria — all of which have helped the rebels combat the Syrian government’s better-armed forces and loyalist militias.
Emerging evidence that Sudan has fed the secret arms pipeline to rebels adds to a growing body of knowledge about where the opposition to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria is getting its military equipment, often paid for by Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Saudi Arabia or other sympathetic donors.
While it is unclear how pivotal the weapons have been in the two-year-old civil war, they have helped sustain the opposition against government forces emboldened by aid from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah.
Sudan’s involvement adds yet another complication to a civil war that has long defied a diplomatic resolution.
The battle has evolved into a proxy fight for regional influence between global powers, regional players and religious sects.
In Sudan’s case, it has a connection with the majority Sunni rebels, and a potentially lucrative financial stake in prosecuting the war.
But Sudan’s decision to provide arms to the rebels — bucking its own international supporters and helping to cement its reputation for fueling conflict — reflects a politically risky balancing act.
Sudan maintains close economic and diplomatic ties to Iran and China.
Both nations have provided military and technical assistance to Sudan’s state-run arms industry and might see sales of its weapons by Sudan to help rebels in Syria as an unwanted outcome of their collaboration with Khartoum, or even as a betrayal.
In interviews, Sudanese officials denied helping arm either side in the Syrian war.
“Sudan has not sent weapons to Syria,” said Imad Sid Ahmad, the press secretary for President Omar Hassan al-Bashir.
Al-Sawarmi Khalid Saad, a spokesman for the Sudanese armed forces, added that the allegations defied common sense, except perhaps as a smear.
“We have no interest in supporting groups in Syria, especially if the outcome of the fighting is not clear,” Mr.
“These allegations are meant to harm our relations with countries Sudan has good relations with.
” A Qatari official said he had no information about a role by his country in procuring or moving military equipment from Sudan.
Sudan has a history of providing weapons to armed groups while publicly denying its hand in such transfers.
Its arms or ammunition has turned up in South Sudan, Somalia, Ivory Coast, Chad, Kenya, Guinea, Mali and Uganda, said Jonah Leff, a Sudan analyst for the Small Arms Survey, a research project.
It has provided weapons to Joseph Kony’s Lord’s Resistance Army; rebels in Libya; and the janjaweed, the pro-government militias that are accused of a campaign of atrocities in Darfur.
“Sudan has positioned itself to be a major global arms supplier whose wares have reached several conflict zones, including the Syrian rebels,” said one American official who is familiar with the shipments to Turkey.
Western analysts and officials said Sudan’s clandestine participation in arming rebels in Syria suggests inherent tensions in Mr.
Bashir’s foreign policy, which broadly supports Sunni Islamist movements while maintaining a valued relationship with the Shiite theocracy in Iran.
Other officials suggested that a simple motive was at work — money.
Sudan is struggling with a severe economic crisis.
“Qatar has been paying a pretty penny for weapons, with few questions asked,” said one American official familiar with the transfers.
“Once word gets out that other countries have opened their depots and have been well paid, that can be an incentive.
” Analysts suspect that Sudan has sold several other classes of weapons to the rebels, including Chinese-made antimateriel sniper rifles and antitank missiles, all of which have made debuts in the war this year but whose immediate sources have been uncertain.
Two American officials said Ukrainian-flagged aircraft had delivered the shipments.
Air traffic control data from an aviation official in the region shows that at least three Ukrainian aviation transport companies flew military-style cargo planes this year from Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, to a military and civilian airfield in western Turkey.
In telephone interviews, officials at two firms denied carrying arms; the third firm did not answer calls on Monday.
Ahmad, the Sudanese presidential spokesman, suggested that if Sudan’s weapons were seen with Syria’s rebels, perhaps Libya had provided them.
Sudan, he said, has admitted sending arms during the 2011 war to oust Col.
Libya’s new leaders have publicly thanked Sudan.
Libya has since been a busy supplier of the weapons to rebels in Syria.
However, that would not explain the Sudanese-made 7.
62x39-millimeter ammunition documented by The New York Times this year in rebel possession near the Syrian city of Idlib.
The ammunition, according to its stamped markings, was made in Sudan in 2012 — after the war in Libya had ended.
It was used by Soquor al-Sham, an Islamist group that recognizes the Western-supported Syrian National Coalition’s military command.
When told that the newly produced Sudanese cartridges were photographed with Syrian rebels, Mr.
Saad, the Sudanese military spokesman, was dismissive.
“Pictures can be fabricated,” he said.
” Sudan’s suggestion that any of its weapons in Syria had been provided by Libya also would not explain the presence of Chinese-made FN-6 antiaircraft missiles in Syrian rebel units.
Neither the Qaddafi loyalists nor the rebels in Libya were known to possess those weapons in 2011, analysts who track missile proliferation said.
The movements of FN-6s have been at the center of one of the stranger arms-trafficking schemes in the civil war.
The weapons, which fire a heat-seeking missile from a shoulder launcher, gained nonproliferation specialists’ immediate attention when they showed up in rebel videos early this year.
Syria’s military was not known to stock them, and their presence in northern Syria strongly suggested that they were being brought to rebels via black markets, and perhaps with the consent of the authorities in Turkey.
After the missiles were shown destroying Syrian military helicopters, the matter took an unusual turn when a state-controlled newspaper in China, apparently acting on a marketing impulse, lauded the missile’s performance.
“The kills are proof that the FN-6 is reliable and user-friendly, because rebel fighters are generally not well trained in operating missile systems,” the newspaper, Global Times, quoted a Chinese aviation analyst as saying.
The successful attacks on Syria’s helicopters by Chinese missiles brought “publicity” that “will raise the image of Chinese defense products on the international arms trade market,” the newspaper wrote.
As the missiles were put to wider use, rebels began to complain, saying that more often than not they failed to fire or to lock on targets.
One rebel commander, Abu Bashar, who coordinates fighting in Aleppo and Idlib Provinces, called the missiles, which he said had gone to Turkey from Sudan and had been provided to rebels by a Qatari intelligence officer, a disappointment.
“Most of the FN-6s that we got didn’t work,” he said.
He said two of them had exploded as they were fired, killing two rebels and wounding four others.
Detailed photos of one of the FN-6 missile tubes, provided by a Syrian with access to the weapons, showed that someone had taken steps to obscure its origin.
Stenciled markings, the photos showed, had been covered with spray paint.
Such markings typically include a missile’s serial number, lot number, manufacturer code and year of production.
Rebels said that before they were provided with the missiles, months ago, they had already been painted, either by the seller, shipper or middlemen, in a crude effort to make tracing the missiles more difficult.
She seemed to recover pretty quickly.
PARIS — Hours after President François Hollande purged leftist members of his government last month for opposing his economic policies, Manuel Valls, France’s combative prime minister, climbed a stage before hundreds of cheering French executives and called for a new relationship with business to lift France from its malaise.
He admonished the left wing of the French Socialist Party to stop posturing against capitalism, then launched into a lengthy pro-business discourse that drew a standing ovation.
“France needs you,” he told the bosses at the annual summer conference of the Medef, France’s employers’ union.
” His speech could have been taken from the playbook of Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, who persuaded his Labour Party to pivot to the center in the 1990s.
But in France, that brand of talk is opening a fractious rift within the Socialist Party, between leftists who fear their leaders are abandoning the party’s ideological core and others who believe that a centrist makeover is needed to save not just modern-day Socialism, but also France itself.
Valls has called a rare confidence vote in the National Assembly for Tuesday, as he tries to corral his party toward reforms and away from what he calls “old Socialism.
” While his government seems likely to succeed, several leftist lawmakers have threatened a rebellion, and, if the vote fails, it could precipitate new elections.
Not just in France, but across Europe, the enduring economic malaise has convulsed governments and sent the political left into a existential crisis.
Even as momentum builds against the austerity policies that Germany has pushed on the eurozone, the question remains whether Europe can afford the welfare systems that have defined the left for generations and that critics blame for ushering in the debt crisis in the first place.
But if the left now backs away from its ideological touchstones, then what does it stand for.
Valls is trying to answer that challenge by calling on his party to embrace policies that emphasize growth over social protections as Europe’s leaders look for ways to stimulate their economies.
He has forged a new solidarity axis with Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy, who has embraced freer markets and labor reforms but, like Mr.
Valls, is also seeking to push back against deeper cuts in public spending.
At a social-democratic rally in Bologna, Italy, this month, both men appeared tieless and in matching white shirts, hugging each other and promising to “unblock Europe.
” “Renzi and Valls have broken with the old European Socialism the way Blair did,” said Gérard Grunberg, a political scientist who studies the left in France.
“Valls is trying to embody a real modernization of the Socialist Party, by challenging the state and putting more confidence in the markets.
” So far, it has not been easy.
In the cabinet reshuffle last month, Mr.
Hollande ousted Arnaud Montebourg, a populist economy minister, and replaced him with Emmanuel Macron, a wealthy former banker at Rothschild who is seen as more friendly to business.
The moves left the traditional base of the Socialist Party feeling angry and betrayed.
Yet to critics elsewhere, the changes still felt like an unsatisfying attempt to split the difference between setting a new direction for the party and remaining true to old Socialist ideals.
“The problem is that Hollande and Valls don’t embody anything at all,” said the French economist Thomas Piketty, whose book “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” explores social inequality in France and elsewhere.
“They are trying to make people believe that Germany is the only country responsible for the catastrophic austerity policy which has plunged the eurozone into stagnation.
” “But in truth,” he added, “the problem is that they are scared of any progress in terms of policy and budgetary union at the eurozone level, which would yet be the only solution to get out of the crisis,” but was likely to require future trimming of the state to meet the European Union’s requirements.
As a tell-all book published this month by Mr.
Hollande’s former companion Valérie Trierweiler accused him of secretly despising the poor — calling them those “without teeth” — a TNS Sofres survey published in Le Figaro gave the president only 13 percent support among the French.
“France is rotting from the top,” Nicolas Baverez, a conservative economist, observed in a recent editorial in the magazine Le Point.
“It is the victim of a political system that is pretending to manage everything, while in reality, it stumbles.
Hollande’s weakness has elevated Mr.
Valls as the de facto strongman of the French government, with a mission to rebrand France as a country that is open for business and willing to temper traditional French protectionism with a warmer embrace of the free market.
Known for his outspokenness and frenetic energy, Mr.
Valls is seen as a freethinker in French politics, and has at times been called the “Socialist Sarkozy” — a reference to Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president, whose conservative Union for a Popular Movement party was also tough on issues like immigration and security.
Valls is presented as a partisan of “the uninhibited left,” Socialists who challenge traditional reforms established by the left.
Valls emphasized the “exhaustion” of the social-democratic model, which he described as a confusing mix of left and right policies.
“Even worse,” he wrote, “it is the left that is now incapable of rejuvenating the welfare state by adapting it to the realities of our time.
” Jean-Jacques Urvoas, a Socialist legislator and a close friend of Mr.
Valls’s, called him a “prickly” man with a “modernist” approach.
“He doesn’t kowtow to the great figures of the left; he is an iconoclast,” Mr.
Valls fashions himself as a torchbearer for the center, seeking peace with the business community and revisiting bedrock Socialist tenets like France’s 35-hour workweek.
Hollande’s mandate grows weaker, there is little doubt that Mr.
Valls will try to pick up the mantle for the Socialist Party heading into France’s 2017 presidential race.
“He doesn’t have that soft image that Hollande does; in that sense he’s viewed as more presidential,” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
“For now, he must follow Hollande’s policies.
But if the captain of the ship has to bow out because he is too weak, he would fancy himself taking a crack at it.
” But the latest polls show Mr.
Valls losing popularity, too, and if the government’s tilt toward the center does not produce better economic results, he will be deeply discredited.
To shore up his Socialist credentials, Mr.
Valls has taken pains to address “the French who are suffering.
Valls is also limited in how much he can go beyond the policies already outlined by Mr.
For now, the two men are, perhaps uncomfortably, joined at the hip.
Hollande has made clear he will not impose new austerity measures, Mr.
Valls must still persuade left-leaning members of their Socialist Party to sign off on cuts of 50 billion euros, or about $65 billion, already pledged through 2017 — something that will remain a hurdle even if the confidence vote passes on Tuesday.
“It’s politically tough to do when you have a left wing of the Socialist Party that want no cuts of any kind in the social welfare state,” Mr.
“That’s where Valls’s main political fight will be.
In another example of the increasingly expensive quest for stand-alone downtown mansions, a relatively new building at 802 Greenwich Street, oft-castigated for having a forbidding salmon-hued exterior devoid of traditional Greenwich Village charm, sold for $42.
5 million and was the week’s most expensive sale, according to city records.
The estimated 2013-14 property taxes for the nearly 12,000-square-foot structure are $154,583.
The multilevel brick mansion, designed with an emphasis on privacy and outfitted with security cameras, sits at the corner of Greenwich and West 12th Street on a lot formerly occupied by a film studio; that nondescript building was demolished after the Texas oil heiress/philanthropist/novelist Hyatt Bass and her husband, Josh Klausner, a screenwriter, acquired the site for $7.
According to permits filed with the city, the top floors of the mansion were set for residential occupancy by the owners (the couple have two children), with the ground floor earmarked for commercial use.
Despite reported input from high-end architects like Annabelle Selldorf and Markus Dochantschi, who is a protégé of the Pritzker Architecture Prize-winning Zaha Hadid, the house apparently was never occupied.
The mansion surfaced in the media as a whisper listing earlier this year, with a vague asking price in excess of $35 million; the actual sale seems to have been conducted without brokers.
The not-so-anonymous sellers used a limited liability company, RHFT; the buyer was recorded as the RHFT Investment Trust, with Jeffrey A.
The sale of 802 Greenwich, formerly known as 335 West 12th Street, follows close on the heels of a $45 million transaction that will transform another Greenwich Village behemoth on a prominent corner, 27 Christopher Street at Waverly Place, into a single-family mansion.
In that instance, the 19,000-square-foot building, built in 1911 and used over the decades as a school, nursing school and outpost of one of the city’s oldest charities, New York Foundling, does at least resemble a chateau.
In a three-story warehouse in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, hundreds of people are working to turn the People’s Climate March planned for Sunday into a visual spectacle.
There were victims of Hurricane Sandy from the Rockaways toiling with artists on a 30-foot inflatable life preserver, and immigrant artists constructing a papier-mâché tree embedded with axes.
Elsewhere, religious leaders were building an ark and scientists were constructing a chalkboard covered with calculations about carbon.
The run-up to what organizers say will be the largest protest about climate change in the history of the United States has transformed New York City into a beehive of planning and creativity, drawing graying local activists and young artists from as far away as Germany.
“This is the final crunch, the product of six months of work to make the People’s March a big, beautiful expression of the climate movement,” said Rachel Schragis, a Brooklyn-based artist and activist who is coordinating the production of floats, banners and signs.
The march, organized by more than a dozen environmental, labor and social justice groups, is planned to wend its way through Midtown Manhattan along a two-mile route approved by the city’s Police Department last month.
at Columbus Circle, then move east along 59th Street, south on Avenue of the Americas and west on 42nd Street, finishing at 11th Avenue and West 34th Street.
Unlike the nuclear disarmament demonstration that drew more than 500,000 people to Central Park for speeches in 1982, the event on Sunday will rely on the marchers themselves to broadcast a message of frustration and anger at what organizers describe as a lack of action by American and world leaders.
, after a moment of silence, marchers will be encouraged to use instruments, cellphone alarms and whistles to make as much noise as possible, helped by at least 20 marching bands and the tolling of church bells across the city.
“We’re going to sound the burglar alarm on people who are stealing the future,” said Bill McKibben, co-founder of the group 350.
org, which is helping to organize the march, and the author of several books about climate change, notably “The End of Nature,” published 25 years ago.
“Since then we’ve watched the summer Arctic disappear and the ocean turn steadily acidic,” Mr.
McKibben said in a phone interview on Wednesday.
“It’s not just that things are not getting better.
They are getting horribly worse.
Unlike any other issue we have faced, this one comes with a time limit.
If we don’t get it right soon, we’ll never get it right.
” Organizers say it is impossible to predict how many people could show up.
But 1,400 “partner organizations” have signed on, ranging from small groups to international coalitions.
In addition, students have mobilized marchers at more than 300 college campuses, and more than 2,700 climate events in 158 countries are planned to coincide with the New York march, including rallies in Delhi, Jakarta, London, Melbourne and Rio de Janeiro.
In New York, organizers are expecting 496 buses from as far away as Minnesota and Kansas to bring marchers.
“The most useful gallon of gasoline anyone will ever burn is the one that gets them to the march,” Mr.
(By contrast, all floats will be pulled by biodeisel-powered cars and trucks or by hand, organizers said.
) The forecast called for mostly sunny weather with a high temperature of 81, which would encourage a larger turnout.
In February 2013, more than 40,000 protesters turned out in Washington to demand action on climate change and to challenge the contentious Keystone XL pipeline.
The police are closing off Central Park West north of Columbus Circle, and organizers are asking marchers to gather from West 65th to West 86th Street, before the start of the march.
Leslie Cagan, a longtime New York activist who coordinated the nuclear disarmament demonstration in 1982, has met numerous times with the Police Department to iron out the logistics of Sunday’s march.
“That area on Central Park West can hold a lot of people — we believe between 80,000 and 100,000,” she said.
The police would not provide estimates of the number of expected attendees.
Organizers have asked marchers to go to various themed staging areas along Central Park West depending on their leanings.
For example, a contingent of labor, families, students and older adults can congregate north of West 65th Street under the rubric “We Can Build the Future.
” Organizers have run phone banks, blanketed subway stations with fliers and issued weekly news releases.
They also produced a 52-minute documentary, “Disruption,” about planning the march.
7, includes footage of meetings and pre-march rallies — interspersed with lessons on climate change and the lagging efforts so far to stop it.
Organizers say they chose Sunday because it comes ahead of a climate summit at the United Nations on Tuesday.
World delegates are expected to hold high-level discussions about climate change that will lay the groundwork for a potential global agreement on emissions next year in Paris.
(Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced on Tuesday that he planned to join the march.
) “When the secretary general invited world leaders to this summit, all of us in the climate justice movement thought, ‘Left to their own devices, these guys will do the same thing they’ve done for 25 years — i.
“So we thought, we better go to New York, too.

American beer is in the midst of a global identity crisis.
Domestic sales of light beer fell again last year, while imported lagers, spirits and wines climbed.
The biggest beer brands in the United States — think Budweiser, Miller and Coors — are now owned, respectively, by people in Belgium, England and Canada.
The nation’s two most popular American-owned beer brands.
Now comes a new bombshell for flag-waving American beer drinkers: Pabst Brewing, owner of some of the most well-loved, all-American, blue-collar brews in the country, will soon be bought by a Cyprus-based beverage conglomerate that calls itself the biggest independent brewer in Russia.
The iconic brand behind Pabst Blue Ribbon, the red-white-and-blue-canned lager founded in Milwaukee before the Civil War, announced late last week that it will be bought by Oasis Beverages, which runs breweries in Moscow, Kazakhstan and Ukraine.
Even in a country where beer ads are typically marked by stock cars, soldiers and patriotic horses, few breweries have American credentials as deep as Pabst’s.
The largest private brewing company in North America, its beers include cheap malts such as Colt 45, Schlitz and Old Milwaukee, as well as regional favorites such as Lone Star (“The National Beer of Texas”), National Bohemian (a Baltimore classic from the “Land of Pleasant Living“), Rainier (“We Heart Seattle”) and Old Style (“Chicago’s Beer since 1902.
”) Oasis has voiced no plans to change that.
It will partner with TSG Consumer Partners, an American private-equity firm, to buy Pabst for about $700 million from billionaire food-industry investor C.
Dean Metropoulos, who bought Pabst for $250 million in 2010.
Oasis Chairman Eugene Kashper, a U.
citizen who lives in New York and will become Pabst’s chief executive, said he will keep the company headquarters in Los Angeles.
In a statement, he extolled the brewer’s American virtue, calling Pabst Blue Ribbon “the quintessential American brand — it represents individualism, egalitarianism and freedom of expression — all the things that make this country great.
” But the announcement of Pabst’s sale to Oasis, which brews a bevy of Russian beers as well as soft drinks and juice, was quickly painted as an American betrayal.
Fans of PBR unloaded on its Facebook page, with one critic pledging to dump all of what he called “the new Communist beer” down the drain.
us, a blog that ridiculed the foreign-owned Budweiser and celebrated Pabst’s American heritage, was replaced, briefly, on Monday with a large four-letter word.
“I was actually surprised at how frustrated I was.
that an American icon was even considering something like this,” said David Lauterbach, the New Yorker who started the Drinkamerican blog after Anheuser-Busch’s sale to foreign buyers in 2008.
“That a red, white and blue beer can that so long had symbolized America would consider essentially selling out.
” Pabst executives have gone on the defensive, issuing a statement poking holes in media reports touting a Russian takeover and saying, “Our new colleagues will remain vigilant in staying true to the brand’s identity.
” Publicly, Pabst has doubled down on its American roots, posing a can of PBR like Gen.
Patton in a flag-draped tweet saying, “Pabst will remain American owned and operated.
” The brewer’s purchase, though, is only the latest drop in the long-swirling sea of the nation’s hyper-globalized beer industry.
Miller Brewing became SABMiller when it was bought in 2002 by South African Breweries.
Coors merged with Canada beer giant Molson in 2005.
In 2008, Anheuser-Busch, the St.
Louis-based maker of Budweiser that had run ads poking fun at Miller’s international roots, was bought by InBev, a Belgian-Brazilian beer conglomerate.
The all-American small-brewer business model that Pabst rode to mainstream glory has changed dramatically, and the alcohol business, once so heritage-driven, has become knotted in a tangle of globe-trotting mergers and mega-deals.
Anheuser-Busch Inbev, the world’s largest beer maker, wants to buy SABMiller, the second-biggest.
SABMiller made an offer to buy the Dutch brewer Heineken — also the second-largest brewer in Mexico, where it brews Dos Equis and Tecate — but the deal was shot down.
, the parent of classic Kentucky bourbons Jim Beam and Maker’s Mark, was bought in January for $16 billion by Suntory Holdings, the Japanese whiskey giant Bill Murray’s character shilled for in “Lost in Translation.
” A Beam spokesman said then, “We operate in a global economy, and the fact is, international ownership is relatively common among successful Kentucky distilleries and bourbon brands.
” (It’s true: Another big distillery, Wild Turkey, is owned by Gruppo Campari, maker of SKYY Vodka and Italian liqueur.
) There are online communities and detailed guides on how to find out whether a beer is American-made.
And drinkers can still buy beers from big American brewers such as Yuengling, based in Pennsylvania, and Samuel Adams, from Massachusetts’ Boston Beer Company.
But American beer drinkers today boast “increasingly global palates,” analysts at Euromonitor International said, and that’s leading them to turn away from light Americana domestics such as Old Style, once advertised as “pure brewed in God’s country.
” Pabst Blue Ribbon has surged among the hipster set, and sales have doubled since 2004, but the broader Pabst brand is still weak in sales.
Last year was Pabst’s slowest for beer shipments in at least a decade, according to data from Beer Marketer’s Insights.
Constellation Brands, the New York alcohol giant and parent of Mexican cervezas such as Corona, Pacifico and Modelo, saw shipments more than triple over the same time period.
Mexican beers, as Euromonitor analysts wrote, “have an aura of vacation and relaxation that appeals to many US consumers.
” Pabst’s losses are tied to the larger trend of light domestic lagers losing ground to wines and spirits.
Even darker brews are looking better: Americans drank more than 1 billion liters of dark beer last year, making it the nation’s fastest-growing type of alcohol.
drinkers also are opting against buying from big brewers and instead turning to a growing flood of craft breweries.
The country had 2,822 running breweries last year, up 39 percent from 2011, and more than 1,000 new craft breweries are in planning nationwide.
The United States is far from losing its status as a brewing heavyweight: About 85 percent of the lager Americans drank last year was made in the United States.
(For brewers, that’s less a patriotic strategy than a logistical one: Americans drink more lager than nearly every other country, so brewing it here helps keep shipping costs low.
) Not many consumer favorites can boast such a high made-in-America share.
So why do some drinkers show such a feeling of loss when an American brand extends overseas.
“I buy an iPhone even though it’s made in China, but it’s designed in California.
I buy Fords even though the parts are made globally but still assembled in the U.
But there’s just this historic, iconic value to a can of beer,” said Lauterbach, the Drinkamerican blogger.
“All these old brands my father used to drink, they’re burnt into my head, back to this time when this was the American way.
They hung in with us in for a couple generations, and then it gets to my generation, and I feel like — what happened.
” Analysts don’t expect the new owners to change too much about the Pabst’s golden brand.
Like Pabst, Oasis has specialized in developing brands tied to city heritage, and its beers command big market share in Moscow and Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan.
Instead, they are likely to try to make more money off Pabst’s strengths: its cool factor, its roots and the public perception it’s still linked to the tiny craft breweries it long left behind.
“Pabst has got a history, it’s got a heritage, it has a vintage factor,” said Amin Alkhatib, an alcoholic beverages industry analyst for Euromonitor in London.
“They’re not going to change the brand, what it stands for.
They’re going to push to increase market share, take on those craft-beer [profit] margins and add a premium factor to the brand.
” But will Pabst weather the worries about foreign tinkering with an American classic.
Benj Steinman, president of the trade publication Beer Marketer’s Insights, said it’s just a matter of time.
When the Miller and Busch brewers were bought, “there was a lot more noise than impact at the time.
And I’m sure the Pabst folks hope it’s the same case this time,” Steinman said.
Late Thursday, Transformer Gallery Board President James Alefantis and Executive Director Victoria Reis issued the following open letter to Smithsonian Secretary Wayne Clough.
The gallery hopes to collect signatures from arts and civil rights groups in the coming days.
"We recognize your leadership and courage in deciding some months ago to support the National Portrait Gallery leadership and curators in exhibiting 'Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture.
' However, we are deeply troubled by your decision to remove the David Wojnarowicz piece from the exhibit.
"As you may know, the 'controversy' over this video art began earlier this week in an article published by the Conservative News Service, a disreputable right-wing on-line publication.
The piece objected to what was described as an 'ant-covered Jesus' and denounced the Smithsonian itself for referring to the art as 'homoerotic.
' Republican leaders John Boehner and Eric Cantor suggested the entire exhibit be cancelled, and threatened the federal funding of the Gallery unless the Smithsonian pulled the Wojnarowicz piece.
William Donohue of the Catholic League initiated a right-wing action campaign directed toward your email address.
"The Smithsonian then pulled the Wojnarowicz video.
We believe this decision is wrong and should be reversed immediately.
"The National Portrait Gallery is supported by U.
taxpayers and, according to press reports, it features signage saying it is committed to 'the struggle for justice so that people and groups can claim their full inheritance in the American promise of equality inclusion and social dignity.
' The Gallery has described the exhibit as 'the first major exhibition to examine the influence of gay and lesbian artists in creating modern American portraiture.
' "Wendy Olsoff, who represents the Wojnarowicz's estate, said: 'David believed the imagery of ants' society was parallel to human society.
' "You must know, but in the event you do not, we the undersigned are here to tell you that your right-wing critics, including in the Congress, know nothing and care nothing about art.
They care not a wit about freedom of expression, or free speech, or 'the American promise of equality, inclusion and social dignity.
' "Do not be afraid of the ants.
Artists and academics promote culture in America, political activists do not.
Americans are facing unprecedented challenges right now at home and abroad, we do not need another phony 'culture war' distraction.
"We agree with the statement of Rep.
Moran, chairman of the subcommittee that provides funding for the country's major art institutions, in today's Washington Post.
'The whole point is that we should not be censoring we should be discussing.
' Moran went on to say that right-wing critics are using the 11 seconds in Wojnarowicz's work involving the ants to undermine your entire exhibit for partisan gain.
"Given your position representing American culture to the world, we are ready to stand with you, if you do the right thing for art and artists around the world and reverse your mistaken decision in this matter immediately.

HOLLYWOOD HILLS: The Hollywood Heights Hotel, which you know as that hulking hotel just south of the Hollywood Bowl, has gotten a little facelift.
It'll now be known as the Hilton Garden Inn Los Angeles/Hollywood and its 160 rooms have been upgraded "with new sleek and modern designs," according to a press release.
Public areas have also been redesigned, but the Hideout Lounge isn't going anywhere.
[Curbed Inbox] MIRACLE MILE: The A+D Museum has teamed up with Woodbury University's Arid Lands Institute for its new Drylands Design exhibit, opening tomorrow.
The show includes "work by architects, landscape architects, engineers, and urban designers responding to the challenges of water scarcity in the face of climate change.
With a focus on the US West, the exhibition will presents a portfolio of adaptive strategies large and small, rural and urban, high tech and low-carbon.

Alla fine anche Gabriele Salvatores non ha resistito e ha ceduto alla tentazione del 'tutti cattivi, tutti insensibili e tutti uguali'.
"I politici guardino il mio film", ha detto il regista al Prix Italia a Torino.
Una frase vaga, ma che sottintende: tutti i politici sono distratti e non sanno cosa succede nella vita dei loro elettori.
Sarebbe però giusto far arrivare un messaggio: oggi qualcuno di noi ci sta provando a cambiare, a riformare la politica.
Il Talk Politico, è in avanzato stato di decomposizione.
Eppure è piuttosto sorprendente vedere come Sabina Guzzanti in La trattativa abbia ripreso set e drammaturgia del talk politico per utilizzarle in un cinema intelligente ed efficace: un esempio civile di riuso dei rifiuti dell'immaginario e dei media.
Questa è a memoria d'uomo la prima volta in cui un Papa arresta un vescovo, usando peraltro le proprie prerogative di capo di Stato.
Il mondo ecclesiastico è abituato a ben altri atteggiamenti: un vescovo non accusa mai pubblicamente un altro vescovo.
Con un Papa che arresta un vescovo finisce un'era ne inizia un'altra: tagliando una sola testa Papa Francesco ha in realtà cambiato di botto migliaia di teste.
Il tema della tutela degli asset di proprietà intellettuale sussiste perché, contrariamente agli USA, vi è una scarsa percezione nelle imprese italiane del valore dei diritti di IP come bene immateriale dell'impresa.
Molte non arrivano nemmeno nelle aule giudiziarie per proteggere il proprio know-how, perché non ne hanno ancora nemmeno compreso il valore.
Così nel rapporto WIPO 2013 l'Italia mostra un deciso ritardo.
Cara Michela, ti tratto con confidenza perché dopo il libro con cui hai vinto il Bancarella ti sento una di casa.
Ti scrivo un po' di corsa perché so che in queste ore ci sarà in Parlamento un altro passaggio importante per la tua legge sul doppio cognome, e lo faccio perché volevo dirti che il primo ad avere il doppio cognome - quello maschile e quello femminile - è stato Gesù.
Mentre prima ti mettevi davanti al teleschermo per capire qualcosa oggi sai già appena vedi Tizio o Caio quello che dirà.
Non c'è più l'effetto sorpresa.
Questa rappresentazione ha stufato.
Non si capisce perché si deve pigiare su quei canali.
Non è un male se i 'malati' di politica che si attaccano ai talk cominciano a ridimensionarsi: il rischio è cadere in depressione per fatti non rispondenti alla realtà.
Mi rivolgo a voi perché ho bisogno del vostro aiuto.
Vogliamo porre fine alla disuguaglianza di genere - e per farlo dobbiamo impegnarci tutti.
Questa campagna è la prima del suo genere all'ONU: vogliamo spingere il maggior numero di uomini e ragazzi possibile a diventare ambasciatori dell'uguaglianza di genere.
E non vogliamo soltanto parlarne, ma essere concreti.
Invito tutti voi a fare un passo avanti e a chiedervi se non io, chi, se non ora, quando.
È difficile prevedere come finirà.
Se lo schieramento riformista, che va da Matteo a Renzi a Forza Italia, potrà avere la meglio su quella specie di sezione italiana della Linke.
La cosa certa è che al termine di quella battaglia, nulla sarà come prima.
Se Renzi sarà sconfitto non resterà che andare ad elezioni anticipate, con tutte le incognite del caso.
Se vincerà, saranno gli altri a dover cambiare.
Mentre in Italia Matteo Renzi e la minoranza Pd si insultavano sull'articolo 18, a New York 300 mila persone manifestavano nella "marcia per il clima", invocando dai governi misure radicali per fermare i cambiamenti climatici.
Le due vicende sono in apparenza del tutto scollegate, ma in realtà rimandano entrambe a una stessa domanda: cosa significa essere di sinistra nell'Italia del 2014.
La protezione costituzionale del lavoro è un lusso che l'Italia non può più permettersi.
I padroni d'Europa e della finanza vogliono un lavoro low cost in una società low cost, e tutto ciò che si oppone a questo loro disegno va trattato come un nemico.
CGIL CISL UIL in questi anni han lasciato passare tutto, eppure a Renzi non basta ancora, per lui i sindacati devono generosamente suicidarsi per fare spazio al nuovo.
Il Summit di New York è un'occasione unica per misurare la volontà degli Stati di agire sul clima.
Nel frattempo, nel resto del mondo, centinaia di migliaia di persone hanno sfilato in una grande "Marcia per il clima".
"Grazie di preferire la speranza all'indifferenza, la mobilitazione alla rassegnazione" recitava uno degli slogan dei manifestanti.
Perché per osare chiedere il cambiamento a coloro che hanno delle responsabilità c'è bisogno anche di loro.
Il 23 settembre ha avuto inizio il campionato mondiale femminile, il primo mai organizzato in Italia.
Dopo la delusione per l'esito della rassegna maschile, con gli Azzurri tredicesimi e un inaspettato primo posto della Polonia padrona di casa in Finale contro il Brasile, è inevitabile che questo mondiale rappresenti anche una sorta di riscatto per l'orgoglio della blasonata pallavolo italiana.
President Barack Obama said Wednesday that voters frustrated by the pace of economic recovery dictated a Republican takeover of the House in midterm elections, adding, "As president I take responsibility" for a failure to restore job growth more quickly.
The president said he was eager to sit down with the leaders of both political parties "and figure out how we can move forward together.
" "It won't be easy," he said, noting the two parties differ profoundly in some key areas.
He spoke at a White House news conference on the day after Republicans captured control of the House and cut deeply into the Democratic majority in the Senate.
"No one party will be able to dictate where we go from here," he said, a clear warning to Republicans that he won't simply bow to their demands for a sharply conservative switch in economic policy.
With his comments, Obama largely followed the lead of Republican leaders who said earlier in the day they were willing to compromise - within limits.
6 percent, both the president and the Republicans will be under pressure to compromise.
Yet neither must lose faith with core supporters - the Republicans with the tea party activists who helped them win power, Obama with the voters whose support he will need in 2012.
The president said the economy had begun a recovery since he took office but Americans became wary when they saw government bailouts of failing banks and two of the Big Three U.
"I think people started looking at all this, and it felt as if government was getting much more intrusive into people's lives than they were accustomed to," he conceded.
Many Republicans campaigned by calling for repeal of the health care legislation Obama won from Congress, but the president said repeal was a nonstarter.
"If Republicans have some ideas" for cutting costs of health care or making other changes in the bill, he said he would be glad to take a look.
"There are going to be some examples of where we can tweak and make progress," he said.
"But I don't think if you ask the American people, `should we stop trying to close the donut hole that helps seniors get prescription drugs, should we go back to where people with pre-existing conditions can't get health insurance'.
I don't think you'd have a strong vote from people saying, `Those are provisions I want to eliminate.
When doctors order X-rays, CT scans, PET scans, M.
’s, ultrasounds and mammograms these days, how are the images stored and transmitted.
All kinds of images can now be captured, reviewed, stored and transmitted digitally, using a standard format called Dicom, for digital imaging and communications in medicine, said Dr.
Hentel, executive vice chairman of the department of radiology at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center.
Dicom files contain not only the images but also information about the patient and how the images were acquired, along with the radiologist’s annotations, Dr.
The viewer can manipulate Dicom data in ways as simple as making standard measurements or as complex as producing detailed three-dimensional representations of the anatomy.
The images may be printed on film or even on paper, Dr.
Hentel said, but most are interpreted by radiologists electronically and stored on systems called PACS, for picture archiving and communication systems.
For those without access to such systems, the Dicom files can be put on a CD-ROM along with a viewing program.
Patients can increasingly expect to have their images securely archived and easily accessible on Web-based or cloud-based services, Dr.
Hentel said, making them available wherever and whenever needed.
Hardly any of the trees chopped down around the College Point Police Academy in late March were dead, contradicting what a city Parks Department representative told the community.
They were instead removed at the request of the lead contractor for the $1 billion project, according to city documents.
The Parks Department signed off on 82 tree removals along College Point Boulevard, 28th Avenue and Ulmer Street, which were carried out to the horror of neighborhood residents.
At an April meeting between Community Board 7 and several city agencies, representatives from Parks and the NYPD said the trees had to be removed because they were dead.
“Right before they were removed, I had two of my foresters go out there with a representative and they inspected every tree and removed all of the dead trees,” Shawn Maerz, deputy director of the Queens Forestry Division, told the meeting.
He went on to detail the harsh conditions that make life hard for other batches of trees that had been planted in the area.
But documents obtained by TimesLedger Newspapers through a Freedom of Information request show that the trees were inspected Feb.
27, about a month before they were cut down and that only eight were classified as dead.
Nearly all were classified as being in poor condition.
Two of the trees were even classified as fair and one as good.
A Parks department spokesman said Maerz misspoke at the meeting and had never held the position that the trees were dead.
But the trees were going to be removed no matter what condition they were in, according to documents obtained from Parks, which shows the College Point construction project will involve tearing up the entire sidewalk and replacing it.
In fact, Maerz had signed a letter addressed to a contractor on the academy project two months before the community board meeting that indicated the removals were entirely to accommodate construction.
“A borough forester inspected the above-mentioned location for the purpose of addressing your trees removal request,” Maerz said in the letter.
“Due to an unavoidable conflict between the trees at the above-listed location and your construction project, Queens Forestry will issue the necessary tree removal permit.
” The letter was addressed to Matthew Nolty, the STV Construction project manager.
Nolty was also at the community board meeting where Maerz spoke.
The NYPD and the city Department of Design and Construction were responsible for orchestrating the removals and hiring an arborist, while Parks only provided an additional arborist to sign off on the removals and comply with the law, according to the department.
Doris Scheer, a 50-year resident of the neighborhood, witnessed the mass felling March 29.
“I came onto 28th Avenue and there was a pile of limbs,” she said.
” Following initial reports of the surprise pruning, a spokesman from Parks said some of the trees were diseased and needed to be removed.
But in contrast to Maerz’s later statement, the spokesman also said many of the trees were being hacked down to make way for the development.
As part of the removal request, the NYPD and STV Construction are required to plant three trees in College Point for every one removed, which comes out to 246.
Parks stated the NYPD will plant 132 of those trees along the street.

By Bill O'Reilly I don't know about you but I'm tired of the phony rhetoric surrounding the ISIS terror threat.
I am also tired of hearing the phrase "boots on the ground" finally I am tired of being misled by the Obama administration.
Syrian moderates cannot defeat the ISIS terror group.
Let me repeat, even if the USA trains Syrian moderates and gives them weapons, they will not -- not be able to defeat the terrorists.
Last week Congress approved arming and training the Syrians possibly to the tune of $500 million.
If that money is actually spent it will be another total waste as the America debt approaches $18 trillion.
Most Congress people know that but they voted symbolically to take action against ISIS.
First of all there is not a single credible military person who thinks the ISIS terror group can be defeated without ground forces.
However, the American people, perhaps rightly so, don't want to send any more of our troops into these chaotic countries.
What about a mercenary army; elite fighters who would be well paid, well trained to defeat terrorists all over the world.
Here's how it would work the fighters would be recruited by America and trained in the USA by our Special Forces.
Army rules of engagement would be followed, strict discipline formed by the Geneva Convention.
America would be in charge of selecting who makes the cut and how they are deployed with an eye on a 25,000-person force.
American and NATO officers would lead the mercenary army and the USA would also provide logistical support basing the first trained soldiers in Kurdistan.
The force would be called the anti-terror army and the cost paid by the coalition that President Obama is trying to put together and these countries that won intelligence and protection from the USA and NATO would have to chip in.
If they don't pay they get no help.
The elite force would be English speaking and because pay checks would be issued soldiers currently in Armed Forces around the world would not be eligible only American and NATO officers in command would be exempt from that.
Each soldier would sign a contract, a three-year commitment and again they would be highly paid.
Finally, it would help a lot if the U.
Congress would formally declare war on terrorism.
And stop trying to coax reluctant sometimes cowardly countries into fighting Islamic terrorism.
Look these terrorists are here to stay.
They are going to kill as many people on this earth as they can.
Just over the weekend the ISIS group released a statement on the net quote, "If you can kill a disbelieving American or European especially the spiteful and filthy French or an Australian or a Canadian or any other disbeliever, then rely upon Allah and kill him in any manner or way however it may be.
" That statement again from ISIS put out there in cyberspace obviously urging mass murder around the world.
So an anti-terror force will eventually have to be raised.
Let's see if President Obama has the foresight and the guts to do it now.

From the NY Post: In a colossal failure of 9/11 security measures, an illegal immigrant used the stolen ID of a Bronx man with an arrest record to get hired as an airline flight attendant, and flew several trips as a trainee before he was busted yesterday, authorities said.
Besides getting a job at American Eagle, Jophan Porter, 38, used the stolen ID to obtain a US passport, a US Department of Transportation ID card and at least three Florida driver's licenses, law-enforcement sources told The Post.
Porter was caught after ID-theft victim Anthony Frair of The Bronx was denied food stamps because government records matched him to the airline job.
A law-enforcement source confirmed that Frair, 40, has an arrest record.
Public records show a man with his name and age was busted in Florida in 2008 on domestic-assault charges.
It's unclear how long Porter used Frair's identity, sources said.
American Eagle hired him in March, and he worked from the airline's Miami base, said company spokesman Tim Smith.
Smith and spokespersons for several federal agencies couldn't explain how Porter cleared the security checks needed to become a flight attendant -- or why the airline didn't realize the ID he had stolen belonged to a criminal suspect.
Yet some electeds continue to support the idea of illegal immigration.
The FDNY, which aimed to purchase a site next to Lou Lodati Park to store a fleet of fire engines, has formerly withdrawn its request to acquire the site.
The FDNY notified the Queens Borough President’s office on July 29 that it no longer seeks the use of the 39-34 43rd Street location, according to a spokesman for the borough president’s office.
The FDNY initially sought the site to keep a reserve fleet of about 100 engines on hand in case any of its vehicles throughout the city broke down.
Additionally, the site was to be used to warehouse its wrecked and decommissioned vehicles.
The plan, which needed to go before the borough president’s office for review, was essentially torpedoed in June–when Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer announced his opposition to it.
“I have serious concerns about these large trucks rumbling in and out a residential neighborhood—adjoining a park where literally thousands of children, pets, and seniors cross the street to go to,” Van Bramer said at the time.
The FDNY needed the approval of the city council to go ahead with the plan and without Van Bramer’s blessing its chances were bleak.
The FDNY withdrew its application before Queens Borough President Melinda Katz even got to weigh in on it.
“I am pleased that the FDNY has decided to withdraw its application for the proposed 43rd Street facility,” Van Bramer said.
“While I support the FDNY and the brave men and women who serve it, this site is not appropriate for this use.
” The proposal, which was controversial from the get-go, drew fierce opposition from adjacent homeowners.
For instance, at the Community Board 2 hearing on the proposal — which was on the same night as the vote– Mike Kenny, a nearby resident said: “This is a residential neighborhood, not suitable for a 24 hour corridor that already suffers from increased noise, pollution and traffic.
” Some of the advocates for the plan, however, argued that it made more sense to work with the FDNY than to have no say over a commercial enterprise that would eventually take over the site.
Their argument was based on the premise that something worse could move in and the community would not be able to weigh in on it.
The plan did receive the approval of Community Board 2, subject to multiple conditions.
Nevertheless, at the time the board rendered its decision the FDNY had not provided the board with any information as to how many big trucks would be rolling in and out of the site.
and Arab allies launched what leaders declared would be a long and sustained military assault against Islamic State strongholds in Syria and Iraq, and the U.
simultaneously targeted an al-Qaida cell said to be plotting imminent attacks on American and other Western interests, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
Hours after the barrage of airstrikes began, Lt.
William Mayville said the attacks took out key Islamic State training camps and facilities.
But he said it was too early to tell if they were able to disrupt a terrorist attack being planned by al-Qaida militants, known as the Khorasan Group.
He said the group was “nearing the execution phase” of an attack against Europe or the U.
President Barack Obama said that Arab support for the airstrikes “makes it clear to the world this is not America’s fight alone.
” “We’re going to do what’s necessary to take the fight to this terrorist group, for the security of the country and the regime and for the entire world,” Obama said as he left Washington for meetings of the U.
Martin Dempsey, the top American military official, said the U.
and its Arab allies achieved their aim of showing the extremists that their attacks will not go unanswered.
and five Arab nations attacked the Islamic State group’s headquarters in eastern Syria in nighttime raids Monday using land- and sea-based U.
aircraft as well as Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from two Navy ships in the Red Sea and the northern Persian Gulf.
Mayville, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the Pentagon that the U.
carried out the vast majority of the strikes in an operation against the Islamic State group that he said would continue and likely last “in terms of years.
” But he declined to provide details on what the Arab nations did.
He said the strikes included Islamic State militants’ financial centers in order to disrupt the well-funded group’s activities.
In Syria, activists said the trikes hit targets in and around the city of Raqqa and the province with the same name.
Raqqa is the Islamic State group’s self-declared capital in Syria.
Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told The Associated Press, “There is confirmed information that there are casualties among Islamic State group members.
” The strikes weren’t coordinated with the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad, Mayville said, but Syrian and U.
informed Syria’s envoy to the U.
Mayville said the Syrian government did not interfere with the operation.
He said the strikes did not specifically target Islamic State group leaders, and that he was unaware of any civilian casualties.
Apparently trying to position his government on the side of the airstrikes, Assad said Tuesday that he supported any international effort against terrorism.
He spoke during a meeting with Faleh al-Fayadh, an envoy of Iraq’s prime minister.
American warplanes also carried out eight airstrikes to disrupt what the military described as “imminent attack plotting against the United States and Western interests” by the shadowy Khorosan Group, a network of al-Qaida veterans working with the Yemeni branch of al-Qaida, known as Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, to get foreign fighters with Western passports and explosives to target U.
was “proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder” with Arab partners, and he called the roll: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Bahrain and Qatar.
All but Qatar actually launched airstrikes.
Qatar played a supporting role.
Dempsey called the strikes an unprecedented coalition with Arab states and said the partnering had set the stage for a broader international campaign against the extremists.
“We wanted to make sure that ISIL knew they have no safe haven, and we certainly achieved that,” Dempsey told reporters as he flew to Washington after a weeklong trip to Europe.
ISIL is an alternate name for the Islamic State group whose fighters swept across much of Iraq this summer.
Dempsey said the five Arab nations’ agreement to join in the airstrikes came together quickly.
“Once we had one of them on board, the others followed quickly thereafter,” he said, adding that the partnership came together over the past three days.
Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking in New York at a counterterrorism forum, said Turkey, too, has joined the coalition and “will be very engaged on the front lines of this effort.
” The president got swift bipartisan backing from Congress.
Republican House Speaker John Boehner called the airstrikes “just one step in what must be a larger effort to destroy and defeat” the Islamic State group.
Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the Arab partners’ involvement was “especially significant.
” Dempsey said the timing was influenced by a concern that word of strikes in eastern Syria could prompt the Khorosan Group to disperse.
Central Command said the bombing mission against that group was undertaken solely by U.
aircraft and took place west of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
It said targets included training camps, an explosives and munitions production facility, a communication building and command and control facilities.
The airstrikes were part of the expanded military campaign that Obama authorized nearly two weeks ago in order to disrupt and destroy the Islamic State militants, who have slaughtered thousands of people, beheaded Westerners — including two American journalists — and captured large swaths of Syria and northern and western Iraq.
The strikes began around 8:30 p.
fired 47 Tomahawk cruise missiles from aboard the USS Arleigh Burke and USS Philippine Sea, operating from international waters in the Red Sea and the northern Persian Gulf.
Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps fighter jets, drones and bombers also participated.
A key ally of Assad, Russia’s foreign ministry warned Tuesday that what it called “unilateral” air strikes would destabilize the region.
“The fight against terrorists in the Middle East and northern Africa requires coordinated efforts of the entire global community under the auspices of the U.
,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.
meetings, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that Iran condemns the Islamic State group and stands ready to help fight terrorism.
policy is confused because it simultaneously opposes the militants while also trying to undermine the government of Syria’s Assad.
Dempsey said Arab participation needs to extend beyond direct military roles to assisting in an international effort to undercut finances, recruiting and ideological support for the Islamic State group.
“What we’re talking about now is the beginning of an air campaign,” he said, adding that it must lead to what he called “the other air campaign” — an effort to fill public airwaves across the Muslim world with arguments for why the extremists must be defeated.
The Pentagon released photos and video showing planes taking off and missiles being launched but was not allowing journalists access to the ships and bases involved in the operation.
military has been launching targeted airstrikes in Iraq since August, focusing specifically on attacks to protect U.
interests and personnel, assist Iraqi refugees and secure critical infrastructure.
Last week, as part of the newly expanded campaign, the U.
began going after militant targets across Iraq, including enemy fighters, outposts, equipment and weapons.
fighter aircraft, bombers and drones have launched about 190 airstrikes within Iraq.
Urged on by the White House and U.
defense and military officials, Congress passed legislation late last week authorizing the military to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels.
Obama signed the bill into law Friday, providing $500 million for the U.
to train about 5,000 rebels over the next year.
A new report by the leading organization for international education data finds that public school teachers in the United States earn only about two-thirds of what similarly-educated U.
workers earn, while teachers in most of the rest of the developed world earn 80 to 89 percent of their peer professionals.
In addition, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development, a member organization of 34 countries across Europe, South America, and the Far East, found that U.
teacher salaries increased only about 3 percent between 2000 and 2011, compared with a 17 to 20 percent increase for teachers in other developed countries.
Public elementary school teachers in the U.
worked an average of 1,097 hours in 2011, almost 40 percent more than the 790 hours for the average teacher in the OECD countries.
high school teachers worked 1,051 hours, some 60 percent more than the 664 hours for upper secondary level teachers in other OECD countries.
Other education indicators in the OECD report, Education At A Glance 2013, found troubling news at both the beginning and late stages of U.
Just half of 3-year-olds and 78 percent of 4-year-olds are enrolled in some kind of early childhood education in the United States, compared with OECD averages of 68 percent of 3-year-olds and 85 percent of 4-year-olds.
At the upper end of education, what the report reveals is that college attainment amongst all U.
adults ages 25 to 64 puts us fifth in the world, but zeroing in on just 24 to 34 year olds — young adults — pushes the U.
Finally, the proportion of young adults who were “NEET” (“not employed or in education or training”) increased between 2008 and 2011, to 15.
9 percent of youth ages 15 to 29, a shade higher than the OECD average, which includes economically devastated countries like Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy.
education system, while mighty, is slipping or standing still, while Korea, Japan, the Russian Federation and Ireland surge ahead in the percentages of its populations that are college educated; Spain, Mexico, France and Belgium enroll far more young children in pre-primary education; and Australia, Israel, Poland and even Portugal have raised teacher pay significantly while U.
teachers have seen almost nothing for a decade.
Is this any way to run an education system.
NPR’s Morning Edition today had the fascinating story of Abel Meeropol, the New York City teacher unionist and social activist who penned “Strange Fruit,” one of Billie Holiday’s most haunting and powerful recordings.
Meeropol, who graduated from the Bronx’s Dewitt Clinton HS in 1921 and later taught English there for 17 years, wrote the poem after seeing a photo of a lynching.
It was first printed in a teachers union publication.
He set it to music, and it eventually made its way to Billie Holiday.
But here’s where his story really gets interesting: He was also the adoptive father of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg’s two sons.
Robert Meeropol [né Rosenberg] says that in the months following his parents’ execution, it was unclear who would take care of him and his brother.
It was the height of McCarthyism.
Even family members were fearful of being in any way associated with the Rosenbergs or Communism.
Then, at a Christmas party at the home of W.
Du Bois, the boys were introduced to Abel and Anne Meeropol.
A few weeks later, they were living with them.
The new documentary film “Bully,” directed by Sundance- and Emmy-award winning filmmaker Lee Hirsch, will see a wider release starting today thanks to a new PG-13 version that contains fewer expletives than the unrated version that has been screening at handful of theaters in NYC and LA.
The movie follows five students over the course of the 2009-10 school year.

A Slate writer on Sunday posted the first two articles in a series about a trove of report cards from a girls’ vocational school in New York City that he discovered in the basement of an old school building.
It sounds like there will be some fascinating stories from his efforts to to learn more about what happened to the school’s graduates — some of whom may be the grandparents of today’s teachers and students: I opened one of the drawers and was surprised to find hundreds, maybe thousands, of old report cards.
Oddly, they were not for Stuyvesant High students.
They were all for teenaged girls who’d attended some sort of trade school back in the early 1900s.
Many of the report cards featured small photographs of the students, and most of them were loaded with unusually vivid commentary about everything from the students’ study habits to their personal appearance (one girl, who apparently had red hair, was described as a “real carrot-head”), all rendered in impossibly perfect fountain-pen script.
Isn’t it awful how we are sometimes more persuaded or at least entertained by style than we are by substance.
Doesn’t it make you feel guilty and isn’t it like a chemical addiction.
Ideas that repel us can grab and hold our attention just because they are conveyed with panache.
We may, for instance, be loyal listeners of radio talk show hosts or television pundits who we know perfectly well are completely in the wrong over practically any issue.
And we may find those who share our views to be crashing bores.
That must explain why almost all major talk show hosts are reactionaries and libertarians.
Though we may be riveted by their pretensions and narcissism, and though one of their favorite targets of abuse is public school educators and our unions, we don’t change the channel, the ratings show.
Many of these “personalities” seem incapable of embarrassment and will engage and shout down audience participants who are far more expert than they are, for they feel entitled to pass as experts on everything under the sun, just because they gab for a maximum of a couple of hours in front of a microphone.

More » In December, the MTA announced plans to cut student MetroCards as part of a package of budget cuts, a move strongly opposed by the UFT.
Without the free passes, a half million New York City school children will be left to finance their own way to school.
On March 17, students from the Urban Youth Collaborative and Students for Transportation Justice will meet with the chairman of the MTA, Jay Walder, to urge him to work with Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Paterson to save their MetroCards.
The Working Families Party has put together a “teachers and parents petition” that the students will take along to the meeting.
They want to walk in with thousands of teachers and parents at their back, to make clear to the MTA — and the media — how important free student MetroCards really are.
Please take a minute to sign this online petition and share it with other teachers, parents or family members of students who might be interested.
Everyday heroes are not always unsung.
On occasion they actually get the recognition they deserve.
If they performed their heroism while on “company time” and their unselfish deed conflicted with company policy and compromised productivity and the “bottom line,” they might not get the approbation from the front office, but at least there usually remains some media attention, even on a slow news day, or a “key to the city” to write home about.
Credit must be given, you might think, to a person whose split-second reaction to sudden danger, saves the lives of strangers.
Such a reflex, as much spiritual and physical, reveals and defines that person’s true character.
Virtuous acts, especially when spontaneous and dramatic, are not done for glory, promotion, or an “employee of the month” citation.
Although their reward is self-validation, even heroes like to be thanked, I am told.
Here is a summary of how three school bus drivers, under similar circumstances, were celebrated.
Banned Books Week, an annual event organized by the American Library Association (ALA), grants readers, parents, teachers and librarians an opportunity to discuss the value of unhindered expression.
Throughout the week, The Huffington Post will highlight voices from various communities impacted by censorship, including LGBT readers, religious writers and Latino bibliophiles.
We will share an excerpt from a frequently challenged graphic novel, and examine the effect book banning has had on literature historically.
We've also invited our readers -- especially those in the education field -- to share photos of the banned books they teach or admire.
We've also taken a look at data provided by the ALA* about which books and authors have been challenged recently, where those challenges occur, and what the cited reasons are for said challenges.
What's the difference between a challenge and a ban.
The ALA explains: "A challenge is an attempt to remove or restrict materials, based upon the objections of a person or group.
A banning is the removal of those materials.
" To find out whether your favorite author is subject to censorship, or whether your state is prone to challenging titles, check out the infographics below: *This data is based on information provided from the American Library Association, from January 1, 2013 to August 6, 2014.
It represents reported challenges, and does not account for those that go unreported.

It will be reoffered for sale in Melbourne in July.

Like many other works produced by Whiteley during his time in New York, it never left the US.
His other works painted at the Chelsea include two portraits of Dylan (one of which is missing).
" Well, there is that other matter regarding the two Brett Whietely’s that hung for many years over the desk in the lobby.
“Tahiti,” as far as we know, never hung in the Chelsea Hotel instead it appears it was part of a private collection.

Check this out from A Walk in the Park: Queens Community Board 7's Parks Committee convened forty-eight hours after a lively full-board meeting where more than a dozen members of the public came out to testify in opposition to the USTA's controversial $ 500 million dollar plan to expand again into Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.
The Parks Committee expected the Parks Department and the USTA to come back with concrete financial numbers to be spent on "park improvements," in exchange for being allowed to build on almost an acre of parkland.
Instead, officials spent a good portion of the night avoiding questions and answering in half-truths.
Board members brought up a host of issues - the loss of parkland, destruction of trees, increased traffic and pollution, high prices of playing at the National Tennis Center, and the city's lack of commitment to take care of the park among others.
Despite repeated requests from the board the USTA has still refused to put its expansion presentation on-line for all to see.
Parks and USTA officials said they have already lined up State Assembly Member Jeffrion L.
Aubry and State Senator Jose Peralta to introduce the alienation bill, which does not require park replacement.
They did not identify the City Council member who will sponsor a Home Rule message that is also required.
"And yes, the Parks Department really need to do a better job of paying attention to the largest green space in the largest borough instead of spending so much damn attention to Central Park and Prospect Park," said Parks Chair Kim Ohanian closing the meeting.
"And we are sick and tired of getting short changed.
You guys treat us like crap and we're tired of it.
"You spend very little money on this park.
You have neglected it, you have treated it like garbage and it's not right.
You don't spend enough money to take care of it.
You don't have enough help, and don't spend enough money and you don't treat it right.
There's no reason why the Fountain of the Planets looks the way that it does.
You've neglected it, you've neglected a lot of that park and shame on you.
" "Please be prepared have answers to the questions that were presented to you tonight.
" We ask questions we deserve answers.
We don't get them they don't get theirs.
" The meeting was adjourned until the first week in March.
(When CB7 will vote yes anyway.
) From The Fairness Coalition: 2) Power Plant in the Park.
The plan calls for building a dirty diesel fuel power plant inside the park.
Hidden inside the most recent DEIS report, the USTA seeks to build an 8 Megawatt, 20 foot high diesel-fueled power plant.
Surrounding communities already suffer from air quality and asthma rates at epidemic levels.
This power plant will emit a massive amount of air pollution into the park and surrounding communities.
(page 11-17 DEIS Jan 2013) So Hevesi, Koslowitz, Peralta and Aubry think a power plant inside Flushing Meadows is a great idea.
How much payoff did these morons get from the USTA.

It's Sheets Week and we're celebrating Millard Sheets, the artist and architectural designer who dotted Southern California with beautiful modern Home Savings bank branches.
Throughout the week we'll be looking at some particularly interesting points in his biography.
Millard Sheets started teaching before he'd even graduated art school and he played major roles in the development and/or creation of three of Los Angeles's most prominent programs--the art department Scripps College, the Otis Art Institute, and CalArts.
Scripps College In 1932, when he was just 25, he was appointed head of the art department at Scripps; he had attended the Chouinard art school and, in his UCLA oral history interview, called the Scripps experience "a great, new, wide adventure into the far beyond for me, never having been to college — as they say, being one of the unwashed.
" He found the facilities lacking, though, and asked the president for $3,300 to build an art barn.
The president suggested instead that Sheets set up a Scripps College Fine Arts Foundation and charge members to attend exhibitions and lectures.
At a Foundation event in Pasadena, a woman from Montclair, New Jersey asked if she could visit the school; when she came, she said.
Inchieste Palazzo Internazionale Assange: Google should be of concern to people all over the world Come da copione, con l’arrivo di settembre è riesplosa la guerra tra politici e dipendenti di Palazzo sugli stipendi.
L’ultima arrivata è la diffida legale a Laura Boldrini e a tutto l’ufficio di presidenza di Montecitorio, affinché non approvino senza il benestare dei sindacati del personale i tagli degli stipendi.
E così Vincenzo Ribet, avvocato in Roma, è diventato il primo legale nella storia ad aver ricevuto mandato da un sindacato dei dipendenti del Parlamento per contrastare l’accelerazione impressa sui tagli; a costo di forzare l’autodichia (cioè l’autonomia di Camera e Senato di darsi regole interne e di non poter ricorrere a giudici esterni) e portare la questione in un tribunale ordinario.
La guerra tra politici e burocrati si trascina dall’inizio della legislatura, in un crescendo bizantino di reciproche contestazioni e distinguo.
Se il passo di carica della vicepresidente della Camera Marina Sereni (Pd), che ha in mano tutto il dossier tagli, è sostenuto dallo stesso premier Renzi (intervenuto a fine luglio con un tweet durissimo contro quanti contrastavano il limite dei 240 mila euro annui alle retribuzioni di Palazzo), i sindacati accusano la politica di non aver voluto seguire il metodo della contrattazione collettiva sulle modifiche ai salari, ma di inseguire un’operazione mediatica fuori da ogni binario di legalità.
Ma da cosa, esattamente, l’Ufficio di presidenza viene diffidato.
L’oggetto dello scontro, stavolta, prende il nome di “tetti intermedi alle retribuzioni”.
In pratica, la Camera non si vorrebbe limitare a recepire quanto stabilito dal decreto-legge 66 del 2014 (quello che istituisce il tetto a 240 mila euro per i dirigenti pubblici), ma introdurrebbe riduzioni proporzionali a tutti i livelli, dagli operai ai consiglieri.
Viene, in pratica, ritenuto inconcepibile che il Segretario Generale passi dai circa 500 ai 240 mila euro annui e il commesso mantenga i suoi 110 mila.
La proposta si è concretizzata in una ipotesi di accordo inviata pochi giorni fa dalla parte “datoriale” ai sindacati di Palazzo Madama e Montecitorio con allegate le tabelle contenenti i nuovi limiti retributivi, suddivisi per categorie.
“L’introduzione di sottotetti non previsti dall’ordinamento generale”, si legge nell’atto di diffida visionato da “l’Espresso”, “costituisce un illegittimo esercizio del potere impositivo in violazione dell’articolo 23 della Costituzione”: un modo come un altro per dire che, a voler esser più realisti del re, si finirebbe per approvare una normativa incostituzionale.
Anche perché nel corso della trattativa, prosegue il documento, “è chiaramente emerso come i sindacati della Camera dei deputati rappresentativi di un’ampia maggioranza dei dipendenti fossero disponibili all’introduzione del limite di 240.
000 euro” “nei termini medesimi previsti presso l’Amministrazione della Presidenza della Repubblica”.
Nulla osta al tetto, quindi, purché fatto tale e quale al Quirinale.
Certo è che il garbuglio giuridico non ha la soluzione dietro l’angolo, favorendo il lievitare inevitabile di rumors e veleni.
Tra i molti circolanti in Transatlantico, da più parti viene accreditata la ricostruzione per cui il “comitato affari del personale”, presieduto da Marina Sereni e la Presidenza stessa avrebbero chiesto lumi a giuristi ed esperti della materia se la strada imboccata fosse percorribile e, avendo ricevuto pareri contrari, li avrebbero chiusi in un cassetto.
In attesa che il tempo passi, magari fino alla prossima legislatura.
Tale scenario accrediterebbe la scelta irrituale, la prima nella storia delle relazioni sindacali di Palazzo, di una diffida legale e di una successiva azione giudiziaria: solo in questo modo, infatti, sarebbe possibile far arrivare la palla fino alla Corte Costituzionale, l’unica in grado di dare una parola definitiva sulla legittimità dei tagli.
Nessuno, dalle parti dell’Ufficio di Presidenza, sembra per ora intenzionato a fare passi indietro e le prossime settimane saranno decisive per approvare il pacchetto di norme che, oltre ai tetti intermedi, introdurrebbe il ruolo unico del personale per Camera e Senato e un meccanismo di valutazione del merito basato essenzialmente sulle ore in più lavorate nel corso dell’anno (da 100 a 60, in base alle singole qualifiche).
Anche perché, stando alle bozze di modifica circolanti, i tempi sono stretti: le nuove regole dovrebbero essere efficaci a partire dal prossimo 1 gennaio.

The fashion world often revolves around creative alliances.
And in the case of the British photographer and T contributor David Sims and the hairstylist Guido Palau, early collaborations proved to be the spark that ignited their careers.
Both hail from similar backgrounds, having grown up around “not sophisticated London,” as Palau describes it, listening to a lot of David Bowie, punk and New Wave music.
They formed an easy friendship in the mid ’80s and soon teamed up behind the lens, building a portfolio of test pictures that would define their respective styles: Sims would often cast lanky kids off the street, letting them do whatever they felt like in front of the camera, while Palau created “non-hair” that was usually messy, unwashed and always offhandedly cool.
The look was a precursor to grunge and quickly caught the attention of Calvin Klein, who hired the duo to shoot his CK campaign featuring Kate Moss in 1993.
It was a pivotal moment for Sims and Palau, yet neither realized it at the time.
“I didn’t think even for a minute we’d end up making anything like a living from it,” says Sims.
“Or be successful,” adds Palau.
And yet that’s exactly what happened: Their early work lead to numerous other shoots for fashion houses (Prada, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs) and magazines (The Face, Harper’s Bazaar, Vogue) as their styles evolved in the decades that would follow.
Their latest endeavor, “Hair” (Rizzoli, out today), is a book of 70 images that represents something of a departure from those street-focused days of yore, and instead depicts models with dressed hair and slightly fixed gazes set against whitewashed backgrounds.
Sims and Palau sat down with T to discuss this new aesthetic, style codes from their youth and what drives their work forward.
Do you remember your first meeting.
David Sims: It was about 1985 or ’86, and I was in between assisting jobs because I had been fired from my first-ever assisting job in London.
I got sacked and ended up assisting a hairdresser, one of the brother owners of Toni & Guy.
Guido Palau: I was freelancing and went in and saw David; that was our first meeting.
Then I started working with Robert Erdmann, a photographer David was assisting.
We used to go on these trips, and we became friends from that.
Later, Dave went out on his own, and asked me to do some test pictures.

The 'Times' will exit two hyperlocal partnerships this year.
() The New York Times' three-year-old experiment in hyperlocal community journalism is coming to an end—for now, at least.
The Times has decided to terminate its collaborations with the journalism schools of New York University and the City University of New York on two websites covering the East Village and the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Fort Greene and Clinton Hill.
Both schools were given notice several weeks ago that the Times intends to end its involvement with the sites—The Local of Fort Greene/Clinton Hill, its CUNY collaboration, and The Local East Village, a site it developed with N.
The schools are still working on a timetable for detaching themselves from the Times, which has given them at least until the end of the year before the partnership officially expires.
“This experiment has had a good run and the Times has learned some valuable lessons about hyperlocal journalism and collaboration," said a senior Times editor who spoke anonymously because the plans had not been made public.
"Now it wants to harvest those lessons and see where they might be applied.
2s’ at The New York Times Originally envisioned as a marriage of professional local reporting and citizen journalism on the neighborhood level, the Times launched the Fort Greene/Clinton Hill Local, along with a since-shuttered sister site covering the New Jersey towns of Millburn, Maplewood, and South Orange, at a time when "hyperlocal" was becoming the industry buzzword of the moment.
This was back in March 2009, when AOL's Patch was still in its infancy and there seemed to be lots of promise for a new breed of community news sites that would scale by selling targeted local online advertising, an end that has proven more difficult to achieve in practice.
The Times, of course, wasn't expecting a huge boost to its bottom line when it got into the game, even though it did sell ads against the various Locals.
But for others who were looking to build up businesses in this space, the paper of record's interest nevertheless seemed a nod of confidence.
The Times also approached the venture with caution, however, noting in a press release that The Local was a "pilot project that is part of an exploration by The Times of ways to extend its journalistic values to serve and engage audiences in new ways.
" It wasn't long before it scaled back its ambitions.
Publishing duties for the Fort Greene/Clinton Hill site were fully handed over to CUNY in January of 2010 (the school was involved from the beginning, but the Times had been at the reins); the Jersey site shut down six months later and was replaced that fall with The Local East Village, which was conceived from the start as a project manned by N.
students and faculty with editorial guidance from the Times.
The Times moved on to other online projects in the meantime, including a collaborative New York education vertical called SchoolBook produced in conjunction with WNYC.
The two surviving Locals continued to benefit from the Times' influential brand, URL and technology platform, but were more or less run independently by the schools, which developed courses around them and hired full-time editor-professors like former Brooklyn Paper editor Gersh Kuntzman to manage them day-to-day.
Simply put: The sites ceased to be a priority for a news organization with no shortage of priorities, including a growing list of new web initiatives that have been rolling out as readers continue to adapt to the paid digital model implemented by the Times last year.
"We're moving on to other things," said a Times spokeswoman.
We think they were very successful and we learned a great deal.
" Several sources familiar with the decision said there were no deep-seated issues or tensions between the Times and the two journalism schools.
One source who's seen the web analytics for the East Village and Fort Greene/Clinton Hill Locals said unique visits to both sites had gone up in the past year.
"It's not a traffic issue," said the source.
As for the schools, both are figuring out what to do with the sites after they shed their Times affiliations.
"We have no timetable and we are reviewing options," said Judy Watson, associate dean of CUNY's Graduate School of Journalism.
Watson also said she doesn't expect recruitment efforts to suffer now that prospective students will no longer be expecting a platform on a Times publication.
"While it's a disappointment, we anticipate no significant impact because so many of our students are able to publish in a variety of media outlets all over the city," she said.
"We remain committed to the project and to finding new ways of working on it, and we're considering a number of interesting options," said Brooke Kroeger, N.
's faculty liaison for The Local East Village.
And the Times spokeswoman didn't kill the idea of a different Times hyperlocal project somewhere down the line, either.
"I wouldn't rule out future hyperlocal experiments if they make sense," she said.
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that the East Village and Fort Greene/Clinton Hill Locals were exempt from the Times' metered pay model.

And just like that, this year's L.
Food & Wine Festival is upon us.
The annual fête, now in its fourth year, always offers a hearty mix of celebrity chefs (both local and national) working the stages via seminars and cooking demos, plus packaged food events that take place in some of the city's best kitchens.
There are the big anchor nights like the Asian Night Market on Friday, which takes over a chunk of Grand Avenue, plus the dual Lexus Grand Tastings midday Saturday and Sunday.
Food & Wine promises to be a multi-day, city-wide feast — at least for anyone able to pony up for the entry fees, the cheapest being a few $50 cooking demos from the likes of Scott Conant and Graham Elliot.
So what can one expect from this year's four day party.
A mix of cheffy glad-handing, incredible food, engaging seminars and endless after-partying.
Here are eight things to be on the lookout for at this year's LA Food & Wine.
The Asian Night Market Perhaps last year's biggest party, the Asian Night Market takes over a stretch of Grand Avenue on Friday night, right in front of the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
Complete with a long red carpet to make guests feel like VIPs, the event is an upscaled take on the night market movement that's only grown more popular in L.
Expect chefs like Charles Phan from the SF's Slanted Door, chef Yoya Takahashi from Hamasaku in L.
and the Iron Chef Morimoto himself serving as emcee.
Chefs Dancing Awkwardly to Common Chicago-born rapper Common is lined up to play to the Grand Avenue crowds on Saturday night's Lexus Live on Grand event.
If last year's Questlove set is any indication, expect plenty of theatrics — and one or two L.
notables really hitting the dance floor hard.
Lots of Out-of-Town Chefs at the Mozzaplex Outside chefs have been pouring into L.
early for the weekend's festivities, and more than a few have been hitting up Chi Spacca and the Osteria.
Silverton herself was hanging around Chi Spacca on Monday night, checking in on guests.
Her Friday lunch event alongside NYC's Jonathan Waxman is already sold out, though the James Beard Outstanding Chef award-winner will be getting her own 10:30 p.
tribute dinner at Vibiana Friday night.
Eric Greenspan Putting Up a Challenge or Two Greenspan has never been one to shy away from friendly chef confrontation, and his aggressive cooking style will be on display at Thursday's Ultimate Bites of L.
Is he going to try to out-charcuterie Ori Menashe, out-fish David Lefevre or out-pastry Jessica Koslow.
An Embarrassment of Wine Riches One half of the Food & Wine equation, the vino is often overlooked at the larger chef-heavy events like the Lexus Grand Tasting.
Don't sleep on the more than 100 international vintners who are descending on L.
from around the world, particularly during the decadent I Heart Champagne & Caviar event on Friday night.
A Rare David Kinch Appearance Kinch, the chef-owner of the recently fire-damaged Manresa, will be taking some rare time away from his Los Gatos restaurant to plate up a $500 dinner alongside fellow Michelin star chefs Michael Cimarusti of Providence, S.
's Dominique Crenn of Atelier Crenn and Pierre Gagnaire of Twist in Las Vegas.
A Whole Bunch of Mash-Up Lunches Priced at around $125 each, these Friday lunch events run from the beach to Beverly Hills to downtown, and tend to actually put together some interesting combinations.
Slanted Door's Charles Phan working a kitchen alongside Hinoki & The Bird's Kuniko Yagi, or Walter Manzke at S.
's Michael Tusk pulling together a four-course lunch (with wine pairings, of course) at Republique.
The After-Parties Like any large-scale event that brings so many like-minded personalities together, it's all about the conversations you overhear — and the after-parties.
Evening events like the Asian Night Market are best for tagging along with chefs who are letting loose in L.
, and it's never hard to find a group of out-of-town cooks heading towards Little Tokyo or down Grand Avenue in search of a late night meal and lots more booze.

Inchieste Palazzo Internazionale Assange: Google should be of concern to people all over the world Entro primavera dovrebbe essere pronto il sistema che consente ai cittadini di avere un identificativo unico per le operazioni online con la pubblica amministrazione.
Che però rischia di non essere pronta per la sfida.
Per non parlare dei rischi connessi alla riservatezza dei dati personali Un codice che permetta agli italiani di identificarsi e di accedere in sicurezza a tutti i servizi della Pubblica amministrazione, anche quelli che richiedono dati estremamente personali, come quelli sanitari.
Un unico sistema che funzioni per tutta la PA, permettendo di prenotare le analisi presso la Asl e scaricare i risultati sul computer di casa o sul telefonino, pagare le tasse o ricevere i rimborsi dell'agenzia delle entrate, iscriversi a un concorso pubblico, ottenere un certificato.
Non solo: uno stesso sistema che consenta di accedere anche ai servizi di aziende private e banche che adotteranno questo passpartout digitale, permettendo così al cittadino di comprare libri da Amazon, oggetti da Ebay e di fare comodamente le operazioni di home banking.
Tecnicamente si chiama “sistema pubblico per la gestione dell'identità digitale di cittadini e imprese” o “Spid”, ma semplificando viene chiamato “pin unico”, e il premier Matteo Renzi se ne è dichiarato entusiasta, perché «la pubblica amministrazione parla tredici linguaggi diversi e il cittadino deve comprarsi il traduttore.
Noi vogliamo che la pubblica amministrazione parli lo stesso linguaggio, al cittadino basta sapere una lingua: il suo pin».
E poi funzionerà davvero o sarà l'ennesimo flop nella travagliata saga dell'Agenda Digitale.
Per chi si aspetta una tesserina plastificata, stile codice fiscale e tessera sanitaria, Spid sarà una sorpresa.
Non ci sarà nessuna tessera, quindi non ci saranno rischi di perdere o dimenticare Spid da qualche parte.
E' un sistema completamente smaterializzato.
E decentralizzato: non sarà lo Stato a rilasciare l'identità digitale ai suoi cittadini, come avviene oggi con passaporto e carta d'identità.
Né il cittadino avrà un obbligo di legge di dotarsi di Spid: lo farà se vorrà accedere ai servizi digitali della PA.
Spid nasce con il Decreto del Fare del governo di Enrico Letta, a lavorarci è l' “Unità di missione per l'attuazione dell'Agenda Digitale” di Francesco Caio, e poi, caduto Letta e decaduta la task force di Caio, l'Agenzia per l'Italia Digitale (Agid).
Andrea Rigoni, esperto di consulenza strategica e cybersicurezza, è uno dei tecnici che ha lavorato a Spid per Caio.
«Il fatto importante è che l'identità digitale io non la ottengo online», spiega Rigoni a l'Espresso, precisando che per ottenerla è necessario presentarsi fisicamente presso uno di quelli che saranno i gestori d'identità, gli “identity provider”, che dovranno fare un riconoscimento fisico della persona che richiede Spid, «un'associazione tra la mia identità reale [verificata con i tradizionali documenti di riconoscimento, ndr] e la mia identità digitale, e mi deve essere consegnata in modo sicuro la prima serie di credenziali, poi da quel momento in poi, tutto è digitalizzato».
Le credenziali sono un codice: il “pin unico”, ma attenzione a pensarlo come un banale pin, perché “dentro” quella sorta di contenitore virtuale che è Spid potranno esserci molte informazioni di noi.
Il decreto del presidente del Consiglio dei ministri che ha creato il sistema è già stato notificato a Bruxelles, se entro il 24 settembre la Commissione Europea non avrà obiezioni, si passerà alla fase attuativa.
L'obiettivo è arrivare all'attuazione di Spid entro la primavera del 2015.
Stefano Arbia di Agid conferma a l'Espresso che «il termine sarà rispettato».
Alfonso Fuggetta, professore al Politecnico di Milano che ha lavorato con la task force di Caio ci spiega che «Spid è importante, ma non è che fatto Spid, abbiamo risolto tutti i problemi.
E' una cosa utile, perché sicuramente favorisce lo sviluppo di servizi più semplici da usare, però i servizi vanno fatti».
Come esempio Fuggetta porta una situazione comune: quando nasce un bambino, va registrato presso l'anagrafe, presso pediatra di turno e Asl per i servizi sanitari e presso l'agenzia delle entrate per il codice fiscale.
Oggi questa trafila viene fatta dal genitore o dal funzionario della pubblica amministrazione, se invece ci fosse un servizio digitale “è nato un bambino” potrebbe automaticamente interagire con tutti i vari sportelli della PA necessari per la completa registrazione.
«Se lo vogliamo, però, va costruito», ci dice Fuggetta, spiegando che Spid sarebbe semplicemente il sistema di identificazione che lo renderebbe possibile.
Ma quanti sono i servizi già disponibili in versione digitale.
Il deputato del Pd, Paolo Coppola, che con il deputato Stefano Quintarelli di Scelta Civica è uno degli ispiratori di Spid, racconta a l'Espresso che, stando alle valutazioni dell'Unione Europea, l'Italia ha una percentuale di servizi di e-government del 100 percento, ovvero tutto quello che il Paese avrebbe dovuto fare in termini di servizi digitali della PA è stato fatto.
«Mi sembra difficile», commenta Coppola, «ma loro dicono così».
Il problema è che, secondo le stesse statistiche dell'Agenda Digitale Europea, nel 2013 solo il 21 percento degli italiani ha fatto uso di questi servizi di e-government.
«E questo denuncia il fatto che questi servizi saranno anche online», conclude Coppola, «ma evidentemente c'è qualcosa che non va se le persone non li utilizzano».
Per il deputato Pd la sfida è progettarli bene e invece «purtroppo, molti servizi sono semplici informatizzazioni della burocrazia cartacea che c'era prima e questo fa sì che l'amministrazione digitale non parta».
I costi di Spid, secondo Agid, non saranno un ostacolo.
«Per lo Stato», ci spiega Stefano Arbia di Agid, «è un'operazione a costo zero e anzi l'amministrazione pubblica ci guadagnerà nel senso che già oggi la PA offre servizi digitali per cui fornisce al cittadino le credenziali di accesso, che hanno un costo, attualmente a carico dell'amministrazione.
Una volta che Spid sarà operativo, saranno i gestori d'identità che si faranno carico di questi costi, liberando così la pubblica amministrazione».
Ma chi saranno gli identity provider.
Soggetti pubblici e privati abilitati a vendere Spid a cittadini e aziende e a fornirla gratuitamente alla PA.
La fila dei candidati è lunga, ma in pole position ci sono Poste Italiane, Telecom e le altre aziende di telefonia, e poi banche.
Il Movimento 5 Stelle non nasconde le sue riserve, non perché contrario alla digitalizzazione della PA, anzi «l'aspettiamo da anni», spiega la deputata M5S, Mirella Liuzzi, a l'Espresso, ma «la possibilità di avere identity provider privati come banche e compagnie telefoniche è qualcosa che ci preoccupa.
Bisognerà vigilare su questo aspetto e sul rischio di commercializzazione dei dati e sulle minacce per la privacy».
Guido Scorza, avvocato e docente, esperto di informatica giuridica, non nasconde alcune perplessità: «Si è scelto di fare dell'identità digitale un oggetto di mercato, un po' come per la posta certificata e le firme digitali», spiega Scorza a L'Espresso, raccontando che l'alternativa poteva essere considerare l'identità digitale come una trasposizione uno-a-uno del documento d'identità, quindi «uno strumento pubblico, non di mercato: non puoi andarti a comprare una carta d'identità».
Allo stesso tempo Scorza spiega che la scelta commerciale è stata fatta essenzialmente per due motivi.
Uno, perché si è pensato che il mercato fosse capace di distribuire Spid più del pubblico: «si è guardato indietro, al famoso caso della posta certificata, addirittura regalata a un certo punto da Renato Brunetta e dallo Stato, in realtà non ha avuto nessun appeal per il cittadino: pochissimi l'hanno richiesta».
E due perché il contesto in cui l'identità digitale verrà spesa è globale e oggi la tendenza in Europa è quella di andare verso un'identità rilasciata non solo da un'autorità pubblica ma anche da soggetti diversi.
Dunque ci saranno grande prospettive di business per gli identity provider.
Per Guido Scorza rimane tutto da vedere.
Una cosa, però, è certa: «se davvero avremo trenta-quaranta milioni di italiani con identità digitale, non penso si possa dire che non esista un rischio per la privacy».
Il Garante per la protezione dei dati personali ha dato un primo parere positivo sul decreto che istituisce Spid, ma è in attesa dei regolamenti tecnici per l'attuazione.
«Abbiamo chiesto che su tali atti, che di fatto dovranno dare risposta ad aspetti fondamentali per la protezione della privacy, sia previsto un nostro parere», spiega a l'Espresso il segretario generale del Garante, Giuseppe Busia.
Sì, perché con Spid gli identity provider avranno miliardi di dati su di noi.
E' vero che Poste, aziende di telefonia e banche li hanno già ora, ma con la digitalizzazione spinta di PA e imprese, il volume dei dati crescerà in modo esponenziale.
L'olandese Rop Gonggrijp, uno dei più grandi hacker europei, che ha scoperto gravi vulnerabilità del voto elettronico e ha lavorato anche con l'organizzazione di Julian Assange, WikiLeaks, non demonizza, però, a priori la digitalizzazione dei servizi: «che siano forniti all'utente per via digitale va bene», spiega Gonggrijp a l'Espresso, «quello che non va bene è che spesso si usa la digitalizzazione come scusa per diminuire la trasparenza o aumentare la sorveglianza».
Per Gonggijp, le soluzioni per salvaguardare la privacy esistono in molti campi, il problema è che i governi non sembrano interessati a usarle «e non lo saranno finché l'opinione pubblica non alzerà la voce».
Dunque tutto il rischio privacy dipenderà da come Spid verrà concretamente implementata.
Stefano Quintarelli, che guiderà il comitato di indirizzo di Agid, è fiducioso: «Un sistema come questo, che prevede di essere soggetto alle leggi italiane e che strutturalmente divida le informazioni in modo che nessuno, a parte le forze dell'ordine italiane su mandato di un giudice, abbia la possibilità di integrare queste informazioni, mi sembra un passo decisamente avanti rispetto al trend attuale.
Oggi, ci sono alcuni comuni che fanno i servizi su Facebook, una cosa ridicola, dal punto di vista del trattamento dei dati degli utenti».
Experts aren't sure of the exact cause of narcolepsy.
It may have more than one cause.
Many people with narcolepsy have low levels of hypocretin (also known as orexin).
This is a chemical made in the brain that helps you stay awake.
In some people with narcolepsy, there are fewer of the cells that make this chemical.
This may be due to an autoimmune reaction.
An auto immune reaction is when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.
Narcolepsy can run in families.
Researchers have found certain genes linked to narcolepsy.

"Team P/J Clean Up Jamaica Now wins big on the trestle saga.
Friday, 9/19/14, work began; the trestle was cleaned & painted.
This is a result of a long fierce fight between team P/J and the borough president/Melinda Katz's staff.
Brewer Boulevard between Archer & Liberty avenues was a national disgrace.
It is a few feet away from York College.
Most appalling, is that residents had no choice.
Residents had to stand in the unhealthy, despicable site because it is a bus stop.
For years the trestle, connecting walls and the entire area were neglected by the DOS and LIRR.
They remained unkept and filthy with a mountain of garbage, grease and grime.
That was until last year when team P/J decided on a relentless pursuit.
Method Of Operation -- WHAT EVER THE HELL IT TAKES.
Earlier this year, the LIRR president/ Helena Williams promised that the area will get a facelift around the third quarter.
However, everyone was dragging their feet as time grew near.
Boranian/ liaison at the borough president's office could not give a specific time frame on which work would start.
Further, told me, " If you cannot wait, you can clean it yourself.
" That is exactly what team P/J and supporters attempted on Labour Day weekend; with my comrade-in-arms, Joe video taping.
However, the area was so stink and dingy that it needed a professional undertaking.
Team P/J continued on the relentless pursuit with supporters' enforcement.
That brings us back to the work in progress that began last week.
There is very positive feed back from residents.
Here are some comments: "I feel more comfortable when standing here now.
" "Wow, is this the same trestle.
" "Waiting here for the bus is no longer a scornful experience.
" Scenes from the trestle wall on Archer Avenue.
The manager, Bob said, that he does not know when the work will be completed.
He was very friendly and polite.
Also, he provided me with a follow up number.
Team P/J will remain on the case until its completion.
His video of clean up events, has proven to be our most effective tool yet.
We've known that the new parking fees will be going into effect this Saturday.
That doesn't mean this is a dead story.
Regional editions of The Boston Globe printed three separate stories today about the increased parking fees.
Heck, even this blog got a mention in one of the articles.
"Grumbles greet hike in T lot fee" focused on commuters using the Worcester-Framingham commuter rail line.
Commuters are frustrated that the parking costs are rising, especially since some lots do not have enough spaces and other lots leave a lot to be desired from a maintenance perspective.
On top of that, the service and experience riding the commuter rail trains leaves a lot to be desired.
Towns along the commuter rail line are fielding calls from citizens who are frustrated at yet another increase to the cost of their daily life.
For commuters who take the train from Framingham, consider using the town owned parking garage near the commuter rail station.
You can purchase monthly passes that are less expensive than the daily MBTA parking rates.
The T answers with their same canned response.
Frankly, I just do not think they get it.
If they got it, they would say "no perks for us - no cars, no lunches, nothing outside of our salaries and our operating budgets.
" But I think the T works in Fantasy Land and the rest of us are stuck working in Reality World.
Spokesman Joe Pesaturo said in an e-mail that commuter-rail parking rates have been unchanged for six years, that the median cost of parking in downtown Boston is $33, and that the agency had to find a way to cover part of the money it owes workers who were recently awarded $53 million in back pay, among other funding needs.
Already shackled by $8 billion in debt, Pesaturo said, the transit agency can't borrow its way out of the situation, and has to raise the money from other sources.
"The decision to ask customers to pay more for parking was very difficult," Pesaturo stated.
has been left with the unenviable choice of seeking fee increases or reducing services.
"The "Commuters balk at T parking rate increases" spoke to commuters along the Fitchburg, Haverhill and Lowell lines.
In this article, Joe Pesaturo said the T is "facing its most daunting challenge" in 9 years.
Hey Joe - why do you still cater your board meeting lunches.
Why does the T just list excuse after excuse after excuse.
Be honest - parking rates aren't going to help the lots be maintained, this is extra money to cover your losses.
Over the past 2 months we've seen a lot of institutions ask for bailouts.
T riders are now bailing out the MBTA by handing over more money to park.
Finally, "Maine balks at the cost of bridge repair" takes the Northern New England point of view on the parking rate increase.
Even Suffolk University's The Suffolk Journal wrote an article about how the increase in parking fees will affect students, faculty and staff.
In an Op-Ed piece also from today's Globe, the Governor outlines how he'll change mass transit and transportation here in the Commonwealth.
Governor Patrick cuts right to heart of one of the issues that plagues both the T and the Mass Pike: patronage.
These authorities were notorious bastions of places where politicians could get jobs for their supporters.
Perhaps that wasn't the best way to run two very important state agencies.
The Governor also said our transportation system is "broken" from an infrastructure standpoint.
He is proposing some drastic steps to realign transportation in Massachusetts:Consolidation of agencies.
System-wide planning and financing of transportation needs.
The first step will be the elimination of the Mass Pike.
Within two years tolls on the Pike west of Route 128 will be removed.
Massachusetts will explore advanced toll collection technologies.
The Big Dig Debt will be restructured.
In a counter-point article, The Boston Herald's editorial staff doesn't think the Governor's proposal will work.
For customer service news, Fox 25 ran this report on Monday about how people are really unhappy riding the MBTA/MBCR commuter rail.
"Late trains, unresponsive customer service, bad signage, poor infrastructure, and increased fees" are just a few of the things people don't like about relying on the commuter rail.
They even showed the fare boxes that people use to pay for their parking.
Fox 25 report Jim Armstrong has a blog where you can read the transcript of Monday's report and see viewer's comments.
Finally, blogger innismir wrote a post that captured just how dysfunctional the T really is.
At innismir's parking lot, the T actually had two different signs explaining the parking rate increase.
innisimr took some photos, so you can see for yourself.
I've worked in corporate communications.
You are supposed to proof things before you send them to the printer.
In this economy, the T doesn't have any more money to waste.
Dan and Joe - how much did the misprinted signs cost us.
From the NY Times: All of this might have Democratic Party leaders — Representative Joseph Crowley is the party boss in Queens — wailing and rending palm cards.
Except that isn’t how it works in Queens.
Power and money are found not so much in the voting booth as in the machine-controlled judicial conventions that pick judges, and in the courthouse on Sutphin Boulevard.
That is where you find Surrogate’s Court, otherwise known as widows and orphans court.
This court appoints guardians who make handsome fees processing the estates of those Queens residents who die without wills.
To enter this court is to stumble upon Ponce de Leon’s own spring, an eternal source of easy money for the politically wired.
The Surrogate’s judge appointed the public administrator, Lois M.
Rosenblatt, who is a fierce and battle-tested elections lawyer, Democratic division.
Rosenblatt reappointed the court’s counsel, who for about a millennium has been Gerard J.
Sweeney’s office pulled down $2.
284 million administering estates.
This year has been slower; through the end of October, his take was $993,764.
As legal sinecures go, it is bearable.
Sweeney’s law firm on Queens Boulevard is a beehive of Queens Democratic worthies; Michael Reich and Frank A.
Bolz III are partners and top party officers.
The geographic metaphysics of their party membership is curious.
All three “Queens” Democrats — Messrs.
Sweeney, Reich and Bolz — live on Long Island.
The current Surrogate’s judge, Peter J.
Kelly, is admirably frank about the ways of this world.
He even frames the questions for you.
“Do I know Sweeney’s related with the Democratic Party and close to Congressman Joe Crowley.
“I would be a moron if I didn’t know that.

EDITOR’S NOTE: Last winter, Comic Riffs wrote an essay (“The Trial Balloon”) on educators tapping the power of graphic novels — a report that was partly inspired by the banning of certain comics in schools.
So Comic Riffs especially applauds that this year, the American Library Association and other groups are putting a special focus on graphic novels for the current Banned Books Week.
Given all the formal complaints that Captain Underpants rates these days, you’d think that were the name of a character in “Fifty Shades of Grey.
” Instead, Dav Pilkey’s illustrated young-reader series by that title tops the list of most frequently challenged books in 2013, as reported by the American Library Association’s Office for Intellectual Freedom.
There we are, “right alongside ‘Fifty Shades of Grey,’ ” says Jeff Smith with a laugh, about his work and Pilkey’s.
His popular graphic-novel epic, “Bone,” cracked last year’s ALA list at No.
10, cited for “political viewpoint, racism, violence” — all wildly far-fetched complaints, Smith tells The Post’s Comic Riffs.
Which is why Banned Books Week, running through Saturday, is such a welcome campaign.
The effort is an annual call to arms and brains among librarians and educators, authors and publishers — with a stated emphasis this year on graphic novels and other comics.
These seven days to spotlight challenges to book access help spark healthy dialogue and illuminate the state of our public shelves.
“Banned Books Week is about entering the conversation the right way,” Smith (“RASL,” “Tuki”), who headlined the Library of Congress’s National Book Festival/Graphic Novel Night last month, tells Comic Riffs.
In terms of challenged books, ” ‘Bone’ is discussed alongside ‘(The Adventures of) Huckleberry Finn’ and Kurt Vonnegut — all my heroes,” continues Smith, whose Eisner-winning “Bone” has been challenged or pulled from school shelves in such states as Minnesota and Texas.
(Twain and Toni Morrison, Steinbeck and J.
Salinger have all made the ALA’s “most challenged” list in years past.
“I love that ‘Bone’ is on the list,” says comics scholar and cartoonist Scott McCloud (“Understanding Comics”), noting that it can reflect that such organizations as ALA take comics seriously.
“The biggest boon Banned Books Week provides is the discussion that is had with honesty and awareness,” Neil Gaiman (“Sandman,” “The Graveyard Book”), the Newbery Medal-winning author and Eisner-winning graphic novelist, tells The Post’s Comic Riffs.
“I get tired of when people say that no books are banned just because” you can get it elsewhere, continues Gaiman, whose “Neverwhere” was recently challenged in New Mexico schools.
“Say you’re a kid in a school district [that banned a book] and there’s not a local Barnes & Noble and you don’t have 20 or 50 bucks in disposable income.
The fact you can buy it on Amazon doesn’t make that any less bad.
” “It’s hard to believe that books are still being banned in 2014, but unfortunately they are, and the pace is not relenting,” Charles Brownstein, executive director of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, tells The Post’s Comic Riffs.
Brownstein, who will speak tonight in Berkeley, Calif.
, as part of a tour of CBLDF events tied to Banned Books Week, highlights the change concerning visual narratives.
“Comics and graphic novels are seeing an increasing amount of challenges,” says Brownstein, whose talk tonight will be titled “Censorship and Comics in America.
” Besides such young-reader favorites as “Captain Underpants” and “Bone,” he notes that Marjane Satrapi’s brilliant “Persepolis” was “the target of an attempted ban in the Chicago Public Schools.
” And that “Fun Home,” the graphic memoir by newly minted MacArthur “genius” grant recipient Alison Bechdel, was “the target of a university funding challenge in South Carolina, where it was assigned as a voluntary reading lesson for incoming freshmen.
” So for Banned Books Week,” Brownstein says, “This year’s focus on comics and graphic novels shines a national spotlight on the steady increase of challenges to comics.
” But that prompts the question: Why ARE comics so frequently challenged in schools and “attacked,” as some say, by cultural critics.
“They’re uniquely vulnerable to challenges because of the medium’s visual nature and because comics still carry a stigma of being low-value speech,” Brownstein says.
“Some challenges are brought against comics because a single page or panel can be taken out of context, while others come under attack because of the mistaken notion that all comics are for children.
” Gaiman, whose body of work spans many different intended audiences, holds a similar view.
“Comics and graphic novels are an easy target,” Gaiman says.
“Historically what tends to happen is, it’s so easy to do a TV-news segment where you pick up an adult graphic novel and stand up in front of the kids’ section [and you say]: ‘Parents think they know what their kids are reading these days.
’ ” But then, Gaiman says, the reporter “holds up comics that are actually aimed at an over-18 audience, meant just for adults” — a clear and irresponsible misrepresentation to try to support a false angle.
“Comics has a peculiar history with censors and the suspension of ideas because it’s an art form that was quite nearly extinguished at one point in its recent history,” says McCloud, citing congressional attacks and the creation of the Comics Code in the ’50s.
“That’s something we can’t say of motion pictures or [other] books or music,” says McCloud, who will speak Thursday night in San Diego with the “Beanworld” creator — in a talk titled, “Beware of Comics.
A Banned Books Week Conversation With Scott McCloud and Larry Marder.
” “This annual celebration of the freedom to read helps create awareness of how vulnerable our right to read is,” Brownstein says of Banned Books Week, “and how communities can make a difference in protecting it.
” This, he adds, is “an important moment to acknowledge that reading, and especially reading of comics, is still under attack.
It’s on all of us to ensure those attacks don’t prevail, so we all enjoy the freedom to read however we choose.

It looks like the vandals are at it again.
smashing windows on cars in the Grafton and Westborough parking lots to grab what they can like GPS units, iPods, laptops, etc.
This is similar to a problem that has been persistent in these parking lots since they're quite isolated and set back from the roads.
Grafton and MBTA police have been stepping up surveillance, but unless they're sitting there 24/7, it's going to be difficult to catch these vandals in the act.
In fact, it might have been two weeks ago when I stepped off the train and there were 3 Grafton police cars in the lot.
I couldn't really tell what was going on, but their presence was felt.
why aren't there video cameras at MBTA parking lots.
Especially in rural ones like the Grafton lot.
This might help the police do a better job of patrolling the lots and it would give us commuters peace of mind.
Especially since we pay $80/month to park there.
The Greater Grafton blog has a great post with pictures regarding these break-ins.

In 1910, the United States—its population exploding, its frontier all but exhausted—was in the throes of a serious meat shortage.
But a small and industrious group of thinkers stepped forward with an answer, a bold idea being endorsed by the likes of Theodore Roosevelt and The New York Times.
Their plan: to import hippopotamuses to the swamps of Louisiana and convince Americans to eat them.
The only thing stranger than the hippo idea itself was the partnership promoting it.
At its center were two hard-bitten spies: Frederick Russell Burnham, a superhumanly competent frontiersman, freelance adventurer, and fervent optimist about America’s future—Burnham would be the inspiration for both the Boy Scouts and Indiana Jones—and Fritz Duquesne, a.
the Black Panther, a virtuoso con man and cynical saboteur who believed only in his own glorification and revenge.
Burnham and Duquesne had very recently been sworn enemies under orders to assassinate each other.
But for one brief and shining moment they joined behind a common cause: transforming America into a nation of hippopotamus ranchers.
In American Hippopotamus, Jon Mooallem brings to life a historical saga too preposterous to be fiction—a bracing and eccentric epic of espionage and hippos, but also of a conflicted nation on the threshold of a bewildering new century, deciding what kind of country it would be, and what beasts it would eat.

AFTER her mother died, Jaye Smith surveyed the boxes around the big, rambling house where she had lived on Staten Island for 50 years and thought, “We’ll worry about them later.
Smith’s mother, Carol Carlisle, a photographer and a former managing editor of Popular Photography magazine, had collected hundreds of photos over her nearly 35-year career.
Smith, an executive coach, appreciated her mother’s eclectic collection, she didn’t know much about its quality.
Then a friend asked if she could have one of her mother’s old photos.
“I had this one that was an old man with some bird cages,” she said.
“I had an eye disease at the time.
I handed it to her and she turned it over and said, ‘It has Cartier-Bresson’s stamp on the back.
’ ” Henri Cartier-Bresson was one of the great photojournalists of the 20th century, and the old man in that photo was Henri Matisse, the painter.
Smith was shocked and had it authenticated.
It was real and Christie’s later sold it privately for more than $14,000.
That was when she took a closer look at her mother’s boxes.
There were four more Cartier-Bresson photos, 64 photos by W.
Eugene Smith and a shot of Lower Manhattan at night in 1932 by Berenice Abbott, a pioneering female photographer.
That one sold for more than $50,000.
There were also 1,200 to 1,400 other photos she didn’t know what to do with.
“I realized I didn’t have the time or the skill to go through this,” she said.
Fortunately she had a friend who knew a professional archivist.
Smith’s inheritance is unique in the value of the works she didn’t know about in her mother’s attic.
But her initial feeling of being overwhelmed and uncertain about what to do with a family member’s collection, whether valuable or sentimental, is not.
“With everyone there is stuff,” said Sallie Bernard, an entrepreneur in Colorado, who faced such a task when her son Jamie, an aspiring artist, committed suicide at age 22.
“But in Jamie’s case there was creative output.
I didn’t know what to make of the artwork or the writings he left behind.
” After talking to friends who had inherited similar collections and been equally overwhelmed, she decided to do something about it.
Through the James Kirk Bernard Foundation, which she and her husband established in their son’s memory, she funded the creation of POBA, a nonprofit group that will display portfolios online but will also help people organize, archive and value a collection they inherit.
The organization’s name is derived from a Tibetan phrase meaning the transformation of consciousness at death to begin a new life.
“I wanted to preserve his creativity,” she said.
“I realized there were many other people who had a similar need that I had.
” One of the services of POBA, which was introduced over the summer, is a guide for handling a collection, whether the value is financial, emotional or a mix of the two.
Nothing can be done until the collection is fully and carefully cataloged.
“Most collections that are left to heirs are not well organized,” said Jennifer Cohen, managing partner of Songmasters, which developed and designed POBA.
“Each art work should be listed: what medium, what dimensions, the year it was created.
” It is a tedious process and one that is easy to put off.
That is what the family of Clark Tippet, a principal dancer of the American Ballet Theater and an award-winning choreographer, did with his choreography, portfolio and performance videos after he died of AIDS at age 37 in 1992.
“They were in my dad’s house in Parsons, Kan.
, upstairs, close to the attic, just boxes and boxes,” said Janie Tippet, one of Mr.
While another sister had handled the royalties for performing his ballets, no one had done anything with the sketches, notes, drawings and photos that went into creating those dances.
There were also three boxes full of videotaped recordings of his dances.
With plans to retire in the fall, Ms.
Tippet began organizing the material this year.
“It was sometimes emotionally hard,” she said.
“But I wanted to do it because he was a very important person in my life and I loved him very much.
” She doesn’t expect to get much, if any, money from the archive but hopes it can be donated to a ballet group that will preserve it for future dancers.
The second step is to make sure the archive is preserved properly.
Bernard hired Rick Schmidlin, a film producer who has worked on the archives of The Doors and the filmmaker Erich von Stroheim, to organize her son’s paintings and drawings.
It cost her about $3,000 for eight days of his time and travel expenses, but the work is now stored in the proper folders and at the right temperature.
Smith said her archivist charged her $25 an hour.
Cohen said there were ways to preserve an archive for less money, including doing a lot of the cataloging and photography yourself.
“The budget is not what’s going to drive things, but understanding the breadth of the estate,” she said.
Of course, a big question with any estate is its value.
Is there one, and if so how can heirs best manage the sale of works.
“When you have an estate that is valuable, either generated by a family member or inherited, there is a proclivity to group the materials and sell them quickly,” Ms.
There are many cases where the value of the artists’ estates are eroded because too many pieces are being sold at once.
” Berta Walker, who owns an art gallery in Provincetown, Mass.
, and has worked with many estates, said heirs needed to be patient and find the right representative.
“The first thing I’d advise anyone is to find out what the area of expertise is,” Ms.
“If you’re trying to sell a California artist, probably coming to Provincetown is not going to be useful.
Smith said that if she had one regret with her mother’s photos it was selling some of them as quickly as she did.
“I got caught up in the enthusiasm of Christie’s and the sale,” she said.
“My family needed the money at the time.
Maybe I would have waited a little bit longer.
I might have ended up keeping them.
Smith sold them through a reputable auction house.
Schmidlin said that in his work in Hollywood he often came across children and grandchildren of celebrities who got fleeced out of their inheritance.
Unscrupulous dealers say “look what the ruby red slippers did,” he said, referring to the shoes Judy Garland wore in "The Wizard of Oz.
"The last time a pair was offered at auction the presale estimate was $2 million to $3 million, though they ended up selling privately for an undisclosed sum.
Schmidlin said, the dealers come back from the auction and say " ‘It didn’t do what the ruby red slippers did, but here’s a check for $150.
’ They’ve lost a very valuable piece of family history.
” His advice is no different from advice given to avoid investment schemes that are too good to be true: Go slowly in finding the expert and be honest with yourself.
“A lot of time they have something that they think is worth something, but it isn’t worth that much,” he said.
“So you have to think, Is it worth losing it or should you preserve it for generations.
Smith said that three years after her mother’s death she was taking her time going through the rest of her mother’s photos.
“There is a sentimental legacy for me,” she said.
And that includes holding onto the W.
Eugene Smith photos that she could probably sell.
“They’re quite beautiful and all postcard-size,” she said.
“It would be fun to find a way to display them.
“It’s amazing,” said Alan Lerner, a social science teacher at John Dewey High School in Brooklyn, which the city tried to close in 2011.
“Now we’re ready to build on our progress.
” Dewey earned a B on the city’s high-stakes progress report this year, after four years of straight C’s.
The school’s impressive performance on the college readiness section of the progress report helped push its overall grade higher.
“I’m just glad we could stick it to Mayor Bloomberg,” said Newtown senior Christyan Gordon, 18.
“I’m delighted we could prove how well this place can work.
” Mayor Bloomberg has made closing struggling schools a central part of his education reform agenda over the past decade.
The controversial policy has angered parents and teachers who often complained that the city had abandoned their schools.
Education officials have defended the closures by pointing to gains in test scores and graduation rates at the new schools that replaced struggling ones.
Stunning HD display When it comes to HD displays, great resolution is just the start.
Unlike many other tablets, Kindle Fire HD also delivers rich color and deep contrast from every angle, with an advanced polarizing filter and custom anti-glare technology.
High Definition Touchscreen Display Rich, immersive, video.
Enjoy your favorite content on a large, beautiful 1920x1200 display, capable of playing movies and TV shows in up to 1080p high definition.
At 254 ppi, the display on Kindle Fire HD 8.
9" is high enough quality that individual pixels are indistinguishable to the human eye.
The result, an unparalleled viewing experience, no matter what you want to watch.
Reduced Screen Glare Most tablet displays are made up of two pieces of glass - an LCD on the bottom and a touch sensor on the top, separated by an air gap.
With an air gap, light reflects off of every surface as it passes through from the front, creating multiple distracting reflections that reduce display contrast.
Kindle Fire HD solves this air gap problem by laminating the touch sensor and the LCD together into a single layer of glass, creating a display that's easy to view, even in overhead light.
Richer Colors at Wider Angles Like many tablets, Kindle Fire HD uses In-Plane Switching (IPS) to improve color reproduction.
But displays that only use IPS still appear washed out at various angles, such as laid sideways when reading in bed, laid flat on a table, or held between you and a friend when sharing a movie.
Kindle Fire HD addresses this issue by applying an advanced polarizing filter directly to the LCD panel.
This results in a display that shows the same deep contrast and rich, detailed color when viewed at any angle.
Booming sound without distortion Low quality sound can ruin your HD entertainment experience.
9" features exclusive, custom Dolby audio, dual stereo speakers, and auto-optimization software for clear, crisp, balanced audio.
Exclusive Dolby Audio Kindle Fire HD uses the power of Dolby Digital Plus to create a world class audio experience, with or without headphones.
Dolby Digital Plus includes technology used to adjust volume, create virtual surround sound, and deliver easier-to-understand dialogue in movies and TV shows.
Kindle Fire HD is designed to automatically optimize the audio profile based on what you're doing, such as watching a movie, listening to music, or talking on Skype.
It even optimizes the audio differently when you have headphones plugged in, so you can just sit back and enjoy.
Powerful Dual Stereo Speakers Big sound.
9", we put stereo speakers on both sides of the display for a wide stereo sound-field similar to that of a home stereo, then tuned them to better reproduce low notes.
The result - deeper bass in your music, loud, rumbling movie soundtracks, and room-filling stereo sound without distortion, even at higher volumes.
Ultra-fast Wi-Fi When it comes to HD content, bandwidth is everything.
Without it, you get video buffering, slow downloads, and dropped connections.
Kindle Fire HD solves this issue by using state-of-the-art dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi for over 40% faster speeds.
Two Antennas, Better Bandwidth Kindle Fire HD is the first tablet to feature dual Wi-Fi antennas and Multiple In/Multiple Out (MIMO) technology for powerful, HD-ready Wi-Fi.
This allows reception or transmission over both antennas simultaneously to increase capacity and reliability.
So you'll enjoy fewer dropped connections, more than 40% faster media streaming, and be able to go further from your wireless hotspot than with other tablets.
Dual Band Support Many Wi-Fi devices, from other tablets to baby monitors, only operate in the 2.
The more of these devices that you and your neighbors have operating in the band, the slower your connection is.
Kindle Fire HD is capable of automatically switching between the 2.
4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi frequencies, which will allow you to use this less congested 5 GHz band for better range and less interference.
Fast, Power-Efficient 4G LTE Kindle Fire HD 8.
9" features 4G LTE technology for ultra-fast mobile broadband, letting you connect to the internet, stream, and download at speeds even faster than Wi-Fi.
Unlike some 4G devices, Kindle Fire HD includes support for 10 bands, so even when you're in a place with no 4G LTE network you'll fall back to the fastest available network and won't lose coverage.
All this with no compromises to battery or weight - Kindle Fire HD combines the most power-efficient LTE chipset available with a custom-designed 4G wireless modem that's only 2.
An AT&T data plan is required to connect to 4G.
If you're not currently an AT&T customer, you can sign up for a data plan right from your device.
See data plan options and browse network coverage.
Please note: the promotional $49.
Uncompromised power under the hood HD content requires more storage, strong processing power, and plenty of battery life.
9" was designed specifically for HD movies and games, giving you lightning fast performance without compromising battery life or storage.
Powerful HD Processor A rich HD display requires a powerful processor to drive it.
The TI OMAP4470 processor in the Kindle Fire HD 8.
9" has 40% more memory bandwidth than Tegra 3, enabling faster web browser JavaScript performance.
9" has an Imagination SGX544 3D graphics core that can process over 12 billion floating-point operations per second, so even graphically intensive games run smoothly and render stunning scenery.
We also tuned the graphics pipeline and touch handling software to eliminate delays between when you touch the screen and when the application responds.
This means the home screen scrolls more smoothly, videos start playing faster, and games respond nearly instantaneously.
Plenty of Storage for HD Content For an HD device, 8GB of storage is not enough.
High definition content is substantially larger - for example, on average, an SD movie is 500MB, and an HD movie is 2GB.
Because of this, Kindle Fire HD 8.
9" offers 32GB or 64GB of storage, as well as free, unlimited cloud storage for your Amazon content.

Indian Censorship and the Curious Case of Wendy Doniger While media coverage has focused on the implications of Penguin's decision to pull the book and destroy all copies in India, there are some important contextual factors to understand to help articulate why this isn't merely a case of religious extremists getting their way (as Doniger has claimed).
What would it be like to embrace and support an alternative future, rather than history, of Hindu studies.
Penguin Books India Gave Up on Freedom of Expression Only days ago, news leaked that Penguin Books India had quietly settled a 2011 lawsuit filed against it by a conservative Indian education reform group, which required the publisher to withdraw and destroy all available copies of the Indian edition of University of Chicago professor Wendy Doniger's book The Hindus: An Alternative History.
The Scholars: An Alternative Story About Wendy Doniger and The Hindus There are Hindus who decline to celebrate a lie.
They refuse to participate in the oblivious celebration of racial, national, and class privilege that denies them their own voice.
They do not share the academic and literary elite's admiration for a book like The Hindus.

The November 1 wedding date of Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald is fast-approaching, and they've only been engaged for a few months, so you know what that means: The couple is in hard-core preparation mode right now.
It's doubtful that anyone was ever under the impression that Ben and Jessa were going to have a Real Housewives-esque wedding, but the adorable pair's nuptials (and party afterward) may be much more low-key and DIY than we thought.
Whether she realized it or not, Jessa just dropped a major hint about her wedding with one, singular Instagram photo.
The bride-to-be posted a picture of herself outside of a Goodwill on Thursday, along with the caption, "Ahh, I love shoppin' at Goodwill.
We've got 5 big, super nice Goodwills within a 15 mile radius.
#spoiled #BuyUsedSaveTheDifference.
" Now, since it's unlikely that Jessa is doing random clothes and/or home shopping a month and a half away from her wedding, one could assume that some of the decorations, etc.
, will be compliments of Goodwill on the big day.
Following in the footsteps of her mom, Michelle, who had one of the most low-key, laid-back weddings of all time (she wore her mother-in-law's wedding dress.
), Jessa has already admitted to not wanting to spend too much money on her wedding, so she and Ben can splurge on their first vacation together.
"I don't want to spend a whole bunch of money and buy a new set of decorations," Jessa told People after getting engaged.
"We will save that money for the honeymoon.
I'm curious to see what Jessa and Ben's wedding will wind up being like.
Since the only hint she's dropped thus far is a Goodwill photo (which may not be much of a hint at all), I'm thinking lots of mason jars and vases.
Hey, you can never go wrong with a mason jar.
What do you think Jessa and Ben's wedding will be like.
The eco-conscious brand Rahua boasts the ultimate in natural resources, the Amazon rain forest, as the foundation of its hair products.
There, women in the Quechua-Shuar tribes have cultivated rahua oil, derived from the rare Ungurahua nut, for centuries.
That they have long, silky hair is no coincidence — the oil tames and fortifies strands, even in the region’s hot and humid climate.
About two decades ago, the hairstylist Fabian Lliguin began using it on his clients in New York.
He even bottled it to create a 100 percent natural line of hair products: shampoos, conditioners, treatments and sprays.
And today, his company introduces its first set of potions for the body — a shower gel ($30), body lotion ($48) and oil ($57) — infused with additional ingredients indigenous to the Amazon rain forest such as Sacha Inchi and Buriti oils.
Like the shampoo and conditioner, the body wash is laced with Palo Santo, the signature scent of the line, plus essences of lavender, eucalyptus and vanilla bean.
And just in time for the sudden drop in temperatures in Manhattan, where the products will soon be available at Barneys New York, the body lotion and oil are superhydrating and packed with restorative goodness to help reverse signs of environmental damage.
Rahua Body is now available at rahua.
Call me nuts, but I want to talk more about sleeping pill use.
Hold your fire for a few paragraphs, please.
Just a week after I posted here about medical efforts to help wean older patients off sleeping pills — causing a flurry of comments, many taking exception to the whole idea as condescending or dismissive of the miseries of insomnia — researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Johns Hopkins published findings that reinforce concerns about these drugs.
I say “reinforce” because geriatricians and other physicians have fretted for years about the use of sedative-hypnotic medications, including benzodiazepines (like Ativan, Klonopin, Xanax and Valium) and the related “Z-drugs” (like Ambien) for treating insomnia.
“I’m not comfortable writing a prescription for these medications,” said Dr.
Cara Tannenbaum, the geriatrician at the University of Montreal who led the weaning study.
“I haven’t prescribed a sedative-hypnotic in 15 years.
” In 2013, the American Geriatrics Society put sedative-hypnotics on its first Choosing Wisely campaign list of “Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question,” citing heightened fall and fracture risks and automobile accidents in older patients who took them.
has reported that a high number of emergency room visits are associated with psychiatric medications in general, and zolpidem — Ambien — in particular.
They’re implicated in 90,000 adult E.
visits annually because of adverse reactions, the study found; more than 19 percent of those visits result in hospital admissions.
Among those taking sedatives and anxiety-reducing drugs, “a lot of visits were because people were too sleepy or hard to arouse, or confused,” said the lead author, Dr.
Lee Hampton, a medical officer at the C.
“And there were also a lot of falls.
” The data also answer questions readers here raised about whether older adults were being singled out.
Did doctors (or did I) consider them unable to make rational drug decisions.
“Is it that older people are less important, full stop.
looked at visits by drug and by age.
Older patients, it turns out, did not show up more often in emergency rooms because of adverse reactions to sedatives and antianxiety drugs.
People ages 19 to 44 have the highest number of visits in proportion to prescriptions for those medicines.
But the consequences were worse for older people.
About a third of those older than 65 (32 percent) who went to E.
s with adverse responses to sedatives were hospitalized, compared with about 13 percent of those 19 to 44 (and 27.
The data also showed that Ambien, the use of which has soared in recent years, accounted for one in five E.
visits among those older than 65, more than any other medication.
“I didn’t expect a single drug to stand out that much,” Dr.
That may be because Medicare didn’t cover benzodiazepines but did cover zolpidem from the inception of Part D in 2003 until last year, when the policy changed.
The Food and Drug Administration, concerned about “next-morning impairment” from Ambien, last year halved the recommended dose for women, to 5 milligrams from 10 milligrams, and to 6.
5 milligrams for extended-release versions like Ambien CR.
The other particular concern for older people is falls, a leading cause of death and disability.
A 2010 analysis of falls says 22 percent of “community dwelling” Medicare beneficiaries older than 65 (excluding nursing home residents) fell in a year.
estimates that a third of older adults fall annually.
Twenty to 30 percent of those falls result in injuries that require medical attention.
“There’s a constellation of risks that contribute to falls, and medications are clearly part of it,” said Dr.
Gurwitz, a geriatrician at the University of Massachusetts Medical School who has studied drug safety in older people.
“And high on the list of those medications related to falls and fall-related injuries are sedative-hypnotics.
” On to some other questions readers raised.
First, for those who objected to collectively referring to benzo and non-benzo sedatives and “not honoring the differences” between them, as Kathy from Hawaii said.
The Z-drugs are approved only as sleep aids.
Benzodiazepines have other uses, like treating panic disorders or seizures; some people may be taking them throughout the day, not only at bedtime.
But as sleeping pills, “I wouldn’t consider them distinct at all,” Dr.
Gurwitz said of the benzos and Z-drugs.
“When you’re talking about falls and fractures, it’s the same effect….
Can patients gradually wean themselves from sedatives, using a chart like the one in the brochure Dr.
Tannenbaum and colleagues sent patients.
In their study, which looked only at benzodiazepine use, the brochure urged recipients to consult health care professionals before embarking on detoxification.
Of the group that attempted to gradually stop the drug, more than half succeeded, and another 22 percent reduced their dosage.
Among those who didn’t make the attempt, the greatest reason — get this — was discouragement from their physicians or pharmacists.
“Often in medicine, the quickest and easiest thing doctors can do is write a prescription,” Dr.
“Things that take longer and require more conversation are used less.
” Yet those remedies — changing sleep habits, seeking cognitive behavioral therapy — have been found to be effective against insomnia.
The physicians I consulted urged patients to seek a comprehensive evaluation, possibly including sleep studies, and then try nonpharmacological remedies first, turning to sleeping pills only after exhausting the alternatives.
JAMA published a patient guide to treating insomnia last year.
A final caveat: Yes, older people are different.
A 65-year-old speedwalker has a different risk profile from an 85-year-old with poor vision or osteoporosis.
But the physicians I consulted couldn’t countenance extended sedative use, even for the former.

From Crains: The City Council on Tuesday proposed legislation to improve the city’s ability to withstand powerful storms like Hurricane Sandy.
The package of bills would raise elevation requirements for new or substantially renovated buildings—including health care facilities—as well as boilers and other critical equipment in flood zones.
The legislation is to be introduced during the council’s main monthly meeting.
A series of oversight hearings have been scheduled before more than 20 council committees over seven weeks.
Substantially renovated means upgrades that amount to 50% or more of a property’s value, a City Council spokesman said.
According to a press release released by the office of council Speaker Christine Quinn, the bills would: Study the feasibility of relocating power lines underground.
The council Committee on Consumer Affairs will examine a bill that would require the mayor’s Office of Long Term Planning and Sustainability to conduct a study over the next six months on the feasibility of placing power lines underground.
The study will review recent power outages in the city and include a list of areas that would most benefit by burying power lines.
Adopt new flood elevation maps.
Legislation would adopt the new FEMA flood advisory maps, expected to be released this week.
The maps would expand the areas that must adhere to flood-proofing requirements in the city’s building code.
Impose new flood-proofing requirements for buildings in vulnerable areas.
Legislation would alter the city’s building code to raise elevation requirements for future buildings in flood zones as well as their boilers and other critical equipment.
The bill would also establish more restrictive flood construction standards for buildings in coastal A-zones, which are areas that may be flooded by coastal waves.
Adopt more stringent codes for health care facilities.

Department of State brought together many of the U.
delegates to this important conference in Cairo, Egypt.
It was an opportunity to reflect on what we did two decades ago and where we are now.
A major theme now, as then, was how do we support women and girls around the world.
Former Secretary of State for Global Affairs, and former President of the U.
Foundation, captured the essence in his speech on Tuesday morning at the State Department.
He said we are all custodians of a set of accomplishments and dreams.
So central to this is the opportunity for women to make decisions for themselves.
We have seen women around the world take charge of their future, and we have advanced the cause by educating girls in country after country.
It was a partnership between and among countries.
Twenty years ago there was tremendous need for women's health.
But HIV/AIDS diagnosis and treatment is transformed when looked at through the lens of women's issues.
The headlines on violence against women in the past few days is now being revealed for what it is, an ongoing problem everywhere.
Sustainable development goals have to include women and development, women's reproductive health and climate change.
Unmet need for women's health is reflected in 250 million women and families who don't have access.
However, maternal mortality has fallen by 50 percent and infant mortality has been reduced by almost as much.
All of us together have made a difference for millions of people around the world.
I am proud to have been a delegate to the conference.
However, I am deeply committed to expanding women's leadership.
Let's celebrate and then get back to work.
Everyone’s talking about the breakdown in the teacher evaluation talks between the mayor and the union as if it were the only chance to fix public education in New York City.
Do we need an evaluation system.
Is it a cure-all for our educational ills.
I am still in the middle of my honeymoon period with teaching, the first career I’ve truly loved.
Sadly, like so many teachers in our city, newbies such as myself and grizzled veterans alike, I am developing a profound sense of regret linked to the growing sensation that I may not be cut out for the classroom, or at least the New York City classroom.
I rarely feel recognized for my work.
I rarely feel effective in the classroom.
I rarely feel like I’m giving my students what they will need to succeed in college and beyond.
Certain mayors, governors, members of Congress and leaders in education reform constantly denigrate teachers.
In fact, there are times when I feel like that is the only topic of national interest where there is a degree of political consensus: Our students are failing and teachers are to blame.
Along with most teachers I know, I’m spending 12 to 15 hours every day teaching, planning lessons, grading papers, developing presentation slides, completing paperwork, enhancing my classroom environment and calling parents.
Once you add in my meals and commute, there’s barely enough time to sleep.
And, new evaluation system or no, I’m being held accountable for everything I do.
Nearly every email in my inbox is marked “high importance” and then followed up with countless check-ins.
Danielson rubric “feedback loops” are happening every month.
Administrators march through my room nearly every week.
My student data binder is thoroughly reviewed by teachers, administrators, network consultants and our superintendent.
Every time I turn around, I’m being told “Good job, but …” And every time a change is suggested to me, I implement it.
Not enough student work on the walls.
Process for completing an assignment unclear.
But when teachers need help, we’re given sympathy without assistance.
Sorry — there are no office supplies available, but you’re supposed to have color-coded charts, class sets of dry erase markers, an array of options for organizers and manipulatives, and even a variety of paper choices to allow for student agency in every assignment.
Sorry — there are no aligned resources for the unit you’re teaching, but still you’re supposed to find content-aligned, leveled, authentic literature for every student in every subject.
These items are presented to me as non-negotiables by the city and my administration.
But what about teacher non-negotiables.
Isn’t it interesting that Common Core Learning Standards were introduced without aligned curricula.
Isolated task bundles full of grammatical mistakes as part of a vast trove of online garbage that I’m supposed to wade through during my free time just don’t cut it.
Isn’t it unfortunate that special education reform and SESIS have been launched without effective citywide training and data-based suggestions for implementation.
Principal- and network-led professional development sessions on these topics reflect the fact that school leaders themselves don’t know what’s going on with special education in New York.
Isn’t it shameful that the people demanding Universal Design for Learning, scaffolding and differentiation, Danielson-aligned teaching practices and data-driven instruction could not offer any of these cutting-edge teaching techniques themselves.
I’m absolutely sick of being told the importance of visual anchors at presentations without any visual anchors.
So is a new teacher evaluation system — one that helps teachers improve — important.
But let’s not forget that without standards-aligned curricula, robust learning resources and a dramatic improvement in teacher morale, there may not be many teachers left to evaluate.

A disciplined career soldier and a veteran of combat in Florida in the 1830s and in the Mexican War, Joseph Johnston resigned from the U.
Army in 1861 to become a brigadier general, and later a general, in the Confederate States Army.
Though he displayed aggressive leadership at First Bull Run, Johnston's command behavior thereafter was cautious.
Assigned in 1861 to command Confederate forces in northern Virginia, Johnston was wounded at Seven Pines in 1862 and replaced by Robert E.
Transferred to the West, he presided over the loss of Vicksburg, then proceeded to fight a defensive war, trying to keep Confederate forces intact for further use.
Gradually falling back before William T.
Sherman, Johnston was relieved of command in July 1864, but later was reassigned to the Army of Tennessee and fought several engagements in North Carolina.
With the approval of President Davis, he approached Sherman with a bid for armistice but the sweeping provisions that were proposed were quickly disapproved by the U.
Should so many women be taking statins.
Medical guidelines issued late last year may double the number of Americans who are told to take these cholesterol-lowering drugs.
But the recommendations don’t distinguish patients by gender, and a small, increasingly vocal group of cardiologists believe that’s a mistake.
Far too many healthy women are taking statins, they say, though some research indicates the drugs will do them little good and may be more likely to cause serious side effects in women.
“If you’re going to tell a healthy person to take a medicine every day for the rest of their life, you should have really good data that it’s going to make them better off,” said Dr.
Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and the editor of JAMA Internal Medicine.
Lowering cholesterol should not be not an end in itself, she added, and cholesterol may not play the same role in heart disease in women as in men.
“You can have high cholesterol and still be really healthy and have a low risk of heart disease,” she said.
Although women represent slightly more than half of the population, they have been vastly underrepresented in clinical trials of statins.
As a result, evidence on the benefits and risks for women is limited.
Women tend to develop heart disease about 10 years later in life on average than men; women’s risk begins to equal that of men when they reach their mid-70s.
Studies have found that healthy women who took statins to prevent cardiovascular disease did experience fewer episodes of chest pain and had fewer treatments like stents and bypass surgery.
But statins didn’t prevent healthy women from having their first heart attacks and didn’t save lives.
The Jupiter trial, which included 6,801 women age 60 and older, found a significantly lower risk of so-called soft endpoints, like hospitalization for unstable angina, among healthy women taking statins.
But the absolute number of these health setbacks was small, and there was no significant reduction in heart attacks, strokes and deaths among these women.
By contrast, male participants on statins had significantly fewer heart attacks and strokes.
“The data are underwhelming, to say the least,” said Dr.
Barbara Roberts, author of “The Truth About Statins: Risks and Alternatives to Cholesterol-Lowering Drugs” and an associate professor of medicine at Brown University.
“Women who are healthy derive no benefit from statins, and even those women who have established heart disease derive only half the benefit men do.
Noel Bairey Merz, director of the Barbra Streisand Women’s Heart Center at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles, disagreed.
“We haven’t shown that we can prevent deaths, because we just haven’t enrolled enough women, and that’s a crime,” she said.
“But the absence of data is not the same as negative data.
” In the meantime, she said, “we can either sit on our hands or use our best judgment to make an educated guess, and can decide to treat.
Bairey Merz has had financial relationships with drug companies, including Abbott Vascular, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Gilead.
) The debate has taken on added urgency because of the risks associated with statins, which often are supposed to be taken daily for the rest of one’s life.
The drugs have long been known to cause muscle pain in some people and, more rarely, liver and kidney damage, as well as cognitive side effects like memory loss and confusion.
In 2010, Johns Hopkins researchers discovered that statins could, in rare instances, make the body produce antibodies against its own proteins, engendering a painful and debilitating muscle disease that actually gets worse when patients stop taking the drugs.
But the most common side effect is diabetes.
In 2012, researchers published a study showing that postmenopausal women who took part in the Women’s Health Initiative were much more likely to develop diabetes if they took statins, and diabetes itself increases the risk of heart disease considerably.
Despite the concerns, women are heavy users of statins, especially in midlife — when the gap in heart disease risk between men and women happens to be greatest.
Some 16 percent of women ages 45 to 64 take statins, compared with 18 percent of men.
9 percent of men 45 and over take statins, compared with 23.
6 percent of women, though significantly more elderly men than elderly women use statins.
Even critics of statin use in healthy women say they would not hesitate to prescribe the drugs to patients with established heart disease.
But since cholesterol readings are increasingly used as quality indicators to rate physicians and health plans, many younger adult women may feel pressured to take the medicine even though they are in good health, some doctors say.
“I have women come to me who were put on statins in their 30s by their physician because their cholesterol was a point or two above what’s said to be normal,” Dr.
” But some healthy younger women certainly will go on to develop cardiovascular disease, Dr.
Bairey Merz said, and statins may help prevent it.
“I’m driving in my car, I’m perfectly healthy.
To some extent, the differences represent different philosophies.
Although the new treatment guidelines recommend lifestyle changes for lowering cholesterol, Dr.
Bairey Merz said: “I think they should probably go out the window.
We have yet to find any kind of lifestyle change intervention that actually helps people live longer.
Roberts advises women that they can reduce their heart risk by watching their weight, exercising and following a diet rich in fish, fruits and vegetables, nuts and olive oil — and, if they’ve never had heart trouble, forgetting statins.
“We know you can get the benefit and relative risk reduction from adhering to a Mediterranean-style diet,” she said.

The executive editor of The New York Times announced broad changes to the newspaper’s leadership Wednesday, replacing titles that had been used for decades and promoting several senior editors.
The editor, Dean Baquet, will retire the job of managing editor, traditionally the second-most senior newsroom position at The Times, and a job he once held, and promote four senior editors — Susan Chira, Janet Elder, Matt Purdy and Ian Fisher — to the new title of deputy executive editor, he wrote in a memo to the staff on Wednesday.
A fifth editor, Tom Bodkin, will be given the title of creative director, a position equal to the four deputy executive editors.
The changes are intended to make the masthead more nimble and responsive, and strategic in dealing with a shifting industry, Mr.
The masthead titles, he said, which have traditionally been seen as something of a coronation, will now be more fluid.
“I anticipate people moving on and off the masthead as our needs evolve,” Mr.
Baquet said, “and it is important that these moves not be seen as measures of who is up and who is down, but rather as appointments aimed at keeping our journalism and our entire operation as vibrant as possible.
” Each deputy executive editor will have a distinct area of responsibility.
Chira, 56, will lead the news report, Mr.
Chira was made an assistant managing editor in 2011, after 30 years at The Times.
She had previously been a Tokyo correspondent, the editor of the paper’s Week in Review section and its foreign editor.
Elder, 58, will manage talent, operations and budget.
She was appointed a deputy managing editor in late 2013, with similar responsibilities, after a long career at The Times that included a stint running its polling operation.
Purdy, 58, will run investigations and enterprise coverage.
He had been an assistant managing editor, overseeing investigative articles across the newspaper, since July 2013.
He was investigations editor for nine years before that, helping that department win five Pulitzer Prizes during his tenure.
He came to The Times from The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1993.
Fisher, 48, will oversee digital operations.
He became an assistant managing editor in January 2013, overseeing the integration of the digital and print sides of the newspaper.
He had previously been a deputy foreign editor and a foreign correspondent.
Baquet also announced the promotion of Mr.
Bodkin, 61, a deputy managing editor and the paper’s longtime head of design.
In addition, Lawrence Ingrassia, 62, a deputy managing editor and the paper’s former Business Day editor, will retire at the end of the year.
Ingrassia, who also led the recent transformation of The International New York Times, Mr.
Baquet said: “Besides leading some of our best coverage, he brought a generation of young reporters to The Times who have made significant contributions to every aspect of our report.
” Three other editors received promotions.
Joseph Kahn, who oversees the paper’s international coverage, will join the masthead, becoming assistant editor for international.
Steve Duenes, the paper’s graphics director, will also join the masthead, as an assistant editor.
Levy, who runs the mobile news app NYT Now, has been promoted to associate editor.
Baquet was named executive editor of The Times in May, replacing Jill Abramson, who was dismissed from the paper’s top editorial position after less than three years in the job.
He said that he was expanding his leadership team because “we have too much work to do to have all the decisions made by a couple of editors in a corner office.
” He added: “Our goals are to get more readers, to continue to stretch the boundaries of storytelling in a mobile world that allows us to do things we never imagined, to take on ever larger targets with our investigative reporting, and to expand our ability to cover a world in turmoil.
Scott Smith takes us back to the early 1980s, a time when fabulous tranny hookers, crack dealers, and punk-wannabes ruled the Chelsea Hotel.
According to Scott, it was also a time of extreme sadness at the Chelsea, as many of the residents began to succumb to AIDS.
What inspired you to move into the Hotel Chelsea.
What inspired us to move into the Chelsea was that my boyfriend at the time and I were both in our early twenties, I had just gotten out of the Marine Corps and we were dead broke and living in a shooting gallery on 10th and Avenue C in the east village when that part of town was scary beyond belief and we thought the time was right for a move uptown to a "de-luxe apartment in the sky".
We had heard that the Chelsea might have vacancies and that they liked artists which my boyfriend was.
Plus I loved the design of the building.
How'd you score your apartment.
will be excerpted this fall in a collection being published by Kleiss Press.
Bill is actually my blogging partner and oldest friend in New York.
We've known each other for more than 23 years now.
We ran Bill in Exile for just over a year and shut it down a couple months ago.
Bill is in prison for 7 and a quarter years for selling meth and our blog was simply the letters that we exchanged with each other every day and that I put up on the internet.
Were the punks still around lighting candles to Sid.
Our interview with Stanley Bard the longtime manager of the Chelsea was, I thought at the time, pretty straight forward.
Realize that I had just gotten out of the Marine Corps and hailed from Kentucky so I didn't know a damn thing about much of anything, least of all New York real estate.
Mike (the bf) and I walked into Stanley's office with a couple of Mike's paintings and started talking to him about renting an apartment.
Stanley wanted to see the paintings we brought and we were only too happy to show them since we intended to try to use them in lieu of a security deposit.
Stanley looked at them, snorted a couple of times and handed us a set of keys to an apartment on what I recall was the 4th floor.
It was basically a large hotel room with a kitchen but it had a cute little wrought iron balcony outside right next to the Hotel Chelsea sign.
After we saw the apartment we told Stanley we loved it and he said "you can move in tomorrow" and that was that.
No security deposit no rent in advance.
I later learned that Stanley's way of doing business was not in the least the norm for New York landlords.
The early 80's had pretty much seen the demise of punk at the Chelsea by then especially after the Sid Vicious Nancy Spungeon killing.
Mostly you saw a lot of punk-wannabees and those who came around hoping to discover some truth about Sid Vicious, but mainly there were really cool tranny hookers in the hotel at the time.
They all had lived in the building for ages and remembered Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungeon and her killing in '78.
How would you describe the Chelsea vibe in the early 1980s.
The vibe at the Chelsea for me has always been really interesting.
When I lived there it was right before crack hit New York really hard but there were definite hints of things to come within the crew that made up the residents of the hotel.
You saw people starting to succumb to the drug and slowly, or not so slowly, and disappearing from it.
Actually, my drug dealer lived a floor above us while we were there and he continued to live in the same apartment for over ten years until he died of AIDS.
That was the big impact on the hotel and the city at that point.
Chelsea as a neighborhood had a quickly growing gay population since everyone in the village to the south was dying like flies and gays that were still alive wanted to flee the hot zone.
During the early 80's the hotel had a kind of sadness hanging over it since so many residents and friends of residents were dying and the gay boys who lived there, like me and my boyfriend, all were pretty much figuring that we'd be dead in a matter of months too.
So when we lived there I'd say that AIDS hung over everything.
Were celebrities dropping by in the 80s.
What was the best/worst thing that ever happened to you at the Chelsea.
Lets see, I walked up the stairs with a very young, very cute Mathew Modine once.
I think the elevator was out and we started chatting and I didn't realize who he was until later which is typical of me since I'm completely hopeless when it comes to spotting celebs.
I rode the elevator with Ed Koch once.
I think he was heading to one of the big penthouse apartments to visit someone.
I used to see Andy Warhol in the lobby all the time with various members of his Factory entourage and his last protégé, Christopher Makos the photographer.
Chris and I became friends and lived near each other in the village for almost 20 years from the late 80's on.
(Photo: Christopher Makos and Andy Warhol , c.
1981) A later celebrity connection that I had to the Chelsea was that of Ethan Hawke.
Although I had long since moved out of the hotel when Ethan lived there he and my brother Kenneth were friends and went to prep school in New Jersey together and even performed together in school plays.
I saw Ethan perform in The Glass Menagerie when he was 16 years old.
The best and worst thing about living at the hotel was that this pre-op tranny hooker named Simonette used to live in our apartment before we moved in.
She had a boyfriend named Tyler who was this incredibly beautiful 20 year old cadet at the U.
Military Academy at West Point.
(Don't ask me how he got away with it but suffice to say that Simonette could pass for a girl under all but the most extreme scrutiny).
Anyway, Tyler had gotten dumped by Simonette before we moved in and apparently she moved without forwarding information and Tyler being smitten and deeply in love was basically stalking her, or at least trying to stalk her but without too much success.
He would show up at our apartment door at all hours crying for her and begging to be let in.
My boyfriend and I ran him off repeatedly at first and he was really making us nuts but then one night we let him in and after sitting around talking to him for hours we basically became best friends.
We ended up helping him get over Simonette and I remain friends with him to this day.
Do you think the Chelsea has a creative spirit.
Without a doubt the Chelsea has a creative spirit.
All one needs to do to confirm that is to walk the halls and you'll feel it.
Or you can step out of the lobby onto 23rd street and look at the various plaques commemorating who lived there if you're less spiritually inclined.
The list of Chelsea residents is long and storied and includes Bob Dylan and Janis Joplin, Bill Burroughs, Gore Vidal, Allan Ginsberg and Tennessee Williams (tons of homos.
) and I think the hotel attracts people who are creative as well as a bit nuts in part because of its history and in part because Stanley used to make it really easy for artistically talented individuals to find a home there.
I also think that the people who live there, once ensconced in residency, feel that artistic spirit within the buildings walls and develop a sense that they need to live up to it and try hard to do so.

The Fate and Future of Black Athletes: It's On Us One of the causes of the bigotry and discrimination in sports is the stereotyping of young Black males as "athletes or nothing.
" National Domestic Violence Hotline Advocates Are the Unsung (and Underpaid) Heroes of the NFL Scandal While it's not feasible that a hotline advocate will ever make even 1/20 of an NFL player's annual salary, it's imperative advocates are paid closer to a solid middle class wage.

A whole weekend -- plus Monday night -- without football.
No Sunday NFL, no Saturday college (non-pro) football, no Monday night football.
And here I am to tell the tale.
Social media provides us all with the channel, the avenue, and the collective voice, to make these issues heard.
No longer can governments and corporations ignore us or avoid our wrath.
Hey, NFL -- I've Got Your Good News Right Here The biggest example of sociopathic behavior related to the NFL has nothing to do with Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson.
It has to do with us, because we're all content to turn a blind eye to this stuff and watch the next game.
The NFL's Crisis Is Just Beginning: No Easy End in Sight Firing Roger Goodell may feel good.
It may even help in the short run, but firing the coach will not fix what's fundamentally wrong with the team in the long run.
Today, every sport is troubled by violence on and off the field, sexual predators, illegal drug usage, and corrupt practices.
In the United States alone, one need only mention names - Bonds, Sandusky, Armstrong, Rice - but the list is endless.
The NFL's history of protecting thugs and hiding brain injuries is inexcusable.
But the real outrage is that taxpayers are funding the construction of coliseums so that bruisers can smash each other in the mouth and billionaires can get richer.
Author, The Peasant Prince: Thaddeus Kosciuszko and the Age of Revolution As a mother, it is my responsibility and commitment to model for my children not just what I hope for them as they reach adulthood, but HOW to do it.

Colleges Prepare Athletes for Bad Behavior in the NFL The NFL may be the subject of most of the upsetting headlines, but look closely and you'll see that their understudies in college don't shine in comparison.
Many big-sport schools fail to educate student-athletes on proper behavior.
After big wins on Thursday and the early Sunday slate, I was sitting pretty.
There were only three four o'clock games, so I debated just sitting out the afternoon and reveling in my glory.
But that is not what problem gamblers do.
Here's my advice to the NFL and the NCAA: if you really, truly want to end violence against women, hire experts who do the research and implement it in our communities.
Why We Can't Turn Our Backs on the NFL While we (or I guess I should hope most of us) are not advocates of violence, including domestic violence, no changes to punishment of the league's players or re-defining policies will actually cause us to stop watching.
The NFL and Rodger Goodell know that.

Inchieste Palazzo Internazionale Assange: Google should be of concern to people all over the world Alle sette e un quarto di stamattina il condottiero degli indipendentisti, Alex Salmond, ha ammesso la sconfitta davanti ai suoi sostenitori.
Il verdetto del referendum uscito dallo spoglio di questa notte è nettamente a favore del “No”, visto che il fronte unionista rappresentato da tutti i principali partiti del parlamento di Westminster ha ottenuto circa il 55 per cento dei consensi contro il 45 per cento di “Yes Scotland”, guidato dal partito nazionalista scozzese di Salmond (Snp).
Un successo che va anche oltre i sondaggi più recenti e che è il frutto probabilmente dell'ultima settimana di campagna referendaria di conservatori, laburisti e liberaldemocratici, preoccupati e impegnati a tutto campo da quando hanno capito che il “Sì” poteva portarsi a casa una vittoria clamorosa, circa dieci giorni fa.
Un contributo potrebbe averlo portato anche la regina Elisabetta quando ha rotto il silenzio dando il “consiglio” alla gente di “pensare bene al futuro”.
Per questo pomeriggio è previsto un suo intervento.
Il primo effetto sui mercati è stata la ripresa della sterlina.
Dopo aver perso terreno nelle ultime settimane sotto la minaccia di una fuga di capitali dalla Scozia, la moneta inglese ha recuperato già stanotte a New York e sui mercati aperti in Oriente.
Alla riapertura delle piazze finanziarie europee ha toccato addirittura i massimi con l'euro dal 2012.
L'esito quasi definitivo (aggiornate alle 8.
30) attribuisce 1,9 milioni di voti agli unionisti e poco più di un milione e mezzo ai secessionisti.
Il risultato delle urne ha portato parecchie sorprese.
Solo in quattro regioni ha vinto il “Sì” e tra queste spicca Glasgow, una roccaforte laburista dove sarebbe stato più prevedibile il verdetto opposto.
Il partito di Salmond ha vinto facilmente anche a Dundee, cittadina della costa orientale e unica tra le grandi a essere amministrata dal Snp.
A cominciare dalla cocente sconfitta di Aberdeen e della regione (Aberdeenshire), circoscrizione elettorale dello stesso Salmond che, ricordiamolo è il primo ministro della Scozia (nel parlamento di Edimburgo il Snp è il partito di maggioranza).
Aberdeen è la capitale del petrolio britannico e l'oro nero era una delle bandiere della campagna indipendentista in quanto possibile fonte di entrate fiscali decisive per un nuovo stato scozzese.
Ma il fronte del “No” ha trionfato anche nelle isole, dalle Orcadi alle Shetland, dove molti avevano scommesso su un risultato opposto.
Il politologo John Curtice ha fatto un'analisi “a caldo” del voto dimostrandosi piuttosto sorpreso per l'ampiezza dello scarto.
Secondo il professore dell'Università di Glasgow, le aree di classe media hanno votato per il “No”, quelle più a base operaia (la stessa Glasgow) per il “Sì”.
Un secondo aspetto da lui sottolineato è che il fronte unionista ha preso molti consensi nelle zone popolate da cittadini scozzesi nati però o provenienti dal resto del Regno Unito.
Terzo punto, per la verità già rivelato da tutti i sondaggi della vigilia, gli anziani si sono pronunciati in massa per restare con Londra.
Tirano un sospiro di sollievo i mercati finanziari e i paesi dell'Unione europea dove ci sono spinte secessioniste, a partire dalla Catalogna.
Applaudono l'establishment britannico e i grandi partiti.
I laburisti, per tradizione il più forte nel parlamento britannico (voti che avrebbero perso nel caso di un divorzio scozzese), si tolgono dall'imbarazzo.
Il premier conservatore David Cameron salva la poltrona, i dieci punti di scarto lo fanno un po' sorridere in un momento per lui molto difficile, in vista delle elezioni inglesi dell'anno prossimo e con il fiato sul collo dell'estrema destra dell'Ukip di Nigel Farage.
Alle 8 italiane di stamattina è apparso in televisione, davanti al numero 10 di Downing street, dicendosi felice e orgoglioso del risultato, ma aggiungendo che «dobbiamo riunirci e andare avanti».
Nel suo breve discorso Cameron ha messo in pratica sullo stesso piano la Scozia con il Galles e l'Irlanda del Nord chiedendo un accordo equilibrato e annunciando novità entro fine anno per dare una legislazione da gennaio che conceda più poteri alle tre regioni nel welfare e nel fisco.

AVALON - Dangling 300 feet above a cactus-filled canyon isn't the first activity that comes to mind when one thinks of visiting Catalina Island.
But that's precisely what a group of eight tourists were doing Thursday as they strapped into harnesses and prepared to fly at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour over treetops and gorges.
"I've never done anything like this before," said Rachel Rushing, a 23-year-old Louisiana resident, as she teetered on the edge of a wooden platform.
"Not where you just step off into nothing.
Her screams echoed through the canyon.
In the Catalina Zipline Eco-Tour, Avalon's latest attraction, thrill seekers are connected to a pulley sliding along 3,671 feet of steel cables that run from the top of Hogsback Ridge, about 600 feet above sea level, down to Descanso Beach.
At one exhilarating point, riders are suspended 300 feet above Descanso Canyon floor, providing an eagle-eye view of mountains and ocean.
It's not a ride for the faint of heart.
"We've seen everything from crocodile tears to cries of excitement," said zipline guide Donald Findlay.
"Once we get people off that first step, it's all fun from there.
" Residents and local business owners hope the Zipline Eco-Tour will also bring some much-needed zip back into the economy.
Hit by the recession and competition from other Southern California getaways, Catalina, once a popular destination, has seen a steady drop in tourism over the past decade.
From 2007 to 2009, tourism plummeted almost 20 percent.
Longtime resident Doug Lord, who runs a business offering snorkeling tours and ocean-rafting trips, believes part of the problem is that many tourists see Avalon as a city stuck in time.
"For years, everyone thought the only thing to do in Catalina was a bus ride and a glass-bottom boat," Lord said.
"We're still fighting that perception.
" The Santa Catalina Island Co.
, which owns 10 percent of the island, is working to change that perception.
The company has poured $11 million into five new projects designed to boost tourism while still preserving the island's old-world charm.
"Catalina is in the midst of a rejuvenation," said Brad Wilson, a spokesman for Santa Catalina Island Co.
"It is not the same place you visited when you were a child, or even compared to two years ago.
" Among the projects is the newly revamped Pavilion Hotel, which celebrated its grand opening Thursday.
The hotel, formerly the Pavilion Lodge, now boasts 71 renovated rooms, many with private lanais, a wine and cheese bar, gardens and two luxury suites with ocean views.
Weekday rates start at $200 a night.
Avalon's newest restaurant, The Avalon Grille, opened May 24.
The menu features classic American comfort food with a creative twist, such as beef brisket on macaroni and cheese, grilled halibut with fried green tomatoes and a buffalo burger (not made from the buffalos on the island).
The Descanso Beach Club is getting a makeover with a new paint job, new bathrooms, a larger open-air restaurant and 14 private cream-colored cabanas available for rent at $125 a day.
Steps away is the new Sea Trek Undersea Adventure, where visitors can strap on specially engineered undersea helmets and take a stroll on the seafloor.
No diving experience is necessary.
Wilson said Sea Trek is still waiting approval from the Coastal Commission and will hopefully open by the beginning of summer.
For now, Santa Catalina Island Co.
hopes the zipline, the only of its kind in Los Angeles and Orange counties, will attract a new generation of tourists.
Ryan Bloeser, a 37-year-old veterinarian from San Clemente, was on a sailing trip with friends when he heard about the zipline and decided to stop in Avalon for a ride.
"I've been coming here with my father since I was 2, so it's good to see Catalina offering some new activities," he said.
"I think it will be a good thing for the island.
" Zipline employees say the ride has been popular since it opened in April.
And not just with the young adrenaline junkies.
"We even had one couple here on their 60th anniversary," said guide Marques Rubio.
The ride takes about two hours and cost $89.
Each paying customer is required to sign a waiver and weigh between 60 and 245 pounds.
The attraction is insured by Santa Catalina Island Co.
The tour consists of five total "zips," with the longest course being just over 1,000 feet.
Each zip takes about 30 seconds.
After the first zip, which is about 500 feet long, shaky participants can opt out of the rest of the ride by walking up a short dirt path back to the main road.
"We call that path the chicken run," Findlay said.
After that, there's no where to go but down.

(Reuters) - The Vatican on Tuesday arrested a former archbishop accused of paying for sex with children while he was a papal ambassador in the Dominican Republic, the first-ever arrest inside the city state on charges of paedophilia.
Jozef Wesolowski, a Pole who was defrocked by a Vatican tribunal in June, has been placed under house awaiting a criminal trial, the Vatican said in a statement.
The 66-year-old Wesolowski is the most prominent church figure to be arrested since Paolo Gabriele, a former papal butler convicted in 2012 of stealing and leaking private papers of former Pope Benedict XVI.
Unlike Gabriele, Wesolowski has not been detained in the Vatican prison, a couple of rooms attached to a courthouse, but was granted house arrest in a Vatican apartment for medical reasons.
Wesolowski was recalled to Rome by the Vatican last year when he was still a diplomat in Santo Domingo and relieved of his duties after Dominican media accused him of paedophilia.
He had been living freely in Rome, and victims of sexual abuse had called for his arrest, expressing concern he might flee.
The former archbishop could face up to 12 years in jail in what will be the first trial for sexual abuse to be held inside the Vatican City.
Wesolowski is also being investigated in the Dominican Republic over accusations he paid boys to perform sexual acts.
He served in the Dominican Republic as nuncio, or ambassador, but no longer has diplomatic immunity.
The Vatican said the arrest reflected the wishes of Pope Francis "that such a grave and delicate case be handled without delay, with the just and necessary rigour".
Francis, the first non-European pope in 1,300 years, has vowed zero tolerance against Roman Catholic clerics who sexually abuse children.
Last May, he called such abuse an "ugly crime" and likened it to "a Satanic Mass".
In July, he told victims of sexual abuse the Church should "weep and make reparation" for crimes he said had taken on the dimensions of a sacrilegious cult.

LAS VEGAS, NV - SEPTEMBER 13: Former champion Mike Tyson laughs at some boxers in the mini ring during the Box Fan Expo at the Las Vegas Convention Center on September 13, 2014 in Las Vegas, Nevada.
(Photo by Alex Menendez/Getty Images) | Alex Menendez via Getty Images LAS VEGAS (AP) — Retired boxer Mike Tyson may be famous for his aggressiveness, but he showed his compassionate side last week when he came to the rescue of an injured motorcyclist who had crashed on a Las Vegas interstate.
Attorney Stephen Stubbs said his client, 29-year-old Ryan Chesley, was on Interstate 15 in Las Vegas at about 9:30 p.
Tuesday when a taxi cut him off and he went down.
Stubbs said Chesley was lying on the ground when he looked up and recognized Tyson, who was yelling at people not to touch Chesley.
"He thought he was hallucinating," Stubbs said.
"He thought he was in some other world.
" Chesley, who had broken bones and torn ligaments, could still use his right hand and snapped a cellphone picture of the heavyweight boxer.
As soon as paramedics arrived, Tyson "just left, like some kind of superhero," Stubbs said.
Mike Tyson's assistant, Steve Lott, said the fighter received a fruit basket a handwritten thank-you note from Chesley on Friday.
"Thank you so much for looking over me after my accident," said the note, which Lott provided to The Associated Press.
"It has to be the most reassuring thing in the world to have Mike Tyson telling people not to touch me.
" Half the fruit in the basket had been consumed by Monday, Lott said, and the pistachios were a particularly popular item.
Chesley will need surgery but has since been released from the hospital, Stubbs said.
A London based private equity firm with the regrettable name ISIS Equity is changing its name to -- well, anything else.
Life has been pretty tough for the ISIS guys lately and I think there are many reasons why the firm's management came to this extremely difficult decision: 10.

Their employees now refuse to work on any Muslim holidays.
They have 500 branded gym bags that no one wants anymore.

When they were recruiting for an analyst, the only one who showed up for an interview was a former member of Al Qaeda.
They got tired of going to restaurants and having the waiters hide all the knives.
It's become impossible to sell their investments since no one wants to negotiate with ISIS.

The future of eight large Queens high schools — and the hundreds of educators who work there — are in jeopardy as the city plans to overhaul the struggling institutions.
The schools could lose up to half of their staff and receive a new principal and name this fall after the city and teachers union failed to reach an agreement on teacher evaluations.
The move could help the city get up to $60 million in federal funds.
Queens Borough President Helen Marshall has scheduled a Feb.
13 community meeting on the issue.
Thirty-three city schools, all on the state’s Persistently Lowest Achieving schools list, could be affected.
“The school kids are being used as a political football between the mayor and the teachers [union\],” said state Sen.
” Schools on the state PLA list face four options.
The first is to shut them down.
The second is to transform them by rewarding teachers for boosting student performance.
The third is to re-start them, by having a charter or management group run the school.
The fourth is to turn them around.
The last option involves keeping up to 50% of the school’s best teachers — which is the city’s plan.
Teachers who lose their jobs will go into an excess pool where they keep their salaries while they float around the school system.
The city is to submit its school turn-around proposal to the state Department of Education next week, a city official said.
Ricky Davis, an aeronautics instructor and teachers rep at August Martin High School, in Jamaica, said the city’s plan is destroying morale at the school.
“What it has done is interrupt the learning process,” he said.
Kathy Carlson, president of the Parents Association at Grover Cleveland High School, in Ridgewood, blames the school’s poor graduation rate on its large number of students who aren’t fluent in English — and therefore take longer to finish high school.
“Firing teachers is not going to help,” she said.
” United Federation of Teachers Queens High School rep James Vasquez said the plan has put school communities in a “panic.
” “They don’t know what’s going to happen,” he said.
Other Queens schools facing a turn-around include Flushing High School; Long Island City High School; William Cullen Bryant High School, in Long Island City; John Adams High School, in Ozone Park; Newtown High School, in Elmhurst; and Richmond Hill High School.
From the Brooklyn Paper: Community leaders are scrambling to landmark the historic stretch of Bushwick known as “Brewers Row” before the buildings are sold and further altered.
Bushwick high school teacher Adam Schwartz has partnered with Councilwoman Diana Reyna (D–Bushwick) to landmark several iconic buildings on Bushwick Avenue and create a historic district around the blocks near Linden Street, Gates Avenue and Bushwick Avenue.
“Identifying buildings and blocks could … preserve Bushwick’s history and culture as well as encourage neighborhood pride,” said Reyna.
The street was once home to beer makers, doctors, a former mayor and even a famous explorer of the North Pole — but the buildings have deteriorated or been altered.
With the help of his 11th and 12th graders at the Academy of Urban Planning, Schwartz has been identifying and documenting buildings for landmark consideration.

After the success of The Muppet Show and the early Muppet movies, Jim Henson embarked on an ambitious project: a fantasy epic that featured only puppets in its cast.
The result, The Dark Crystal, was released in 1982 and is an ingenious and magical film.
Set in a faraway land filled with strange creatures like Gelflings and Skeksis, The Dark Crystal, co-directed by Muppet performer Frank Oz, is responsible for inducing nightmares among a generation of children who saw it three decades ago.
I somehow managed to miss it (I was always more of a Labyrinth kid, myself), so I thought I’d give it a shot in honor of Jim Henson’s birthday (he’d be turning 78 today.
0:53: We’re not even a minute in and The Dark Crystal is living up to at least half of its title.
Things are going to be pretttttty bleak.
He is a Gelfling, which is like an elf but with a G and a -ling attached.
He is the last remaining Gelfling, after the entire race was wiped out by the evil and ugly Skeksis.
But that doesn’t stop him from giving great wisdom to Jen, and from instructing him to go find the crystal shard.
(This is already getting into Lord of the Rings territory.
Think of this guy as a puppet Gandalf.
) 15:22: I don’t want to sound like I’m Team Skeksis here, but if I looked like that I’d probably be mean and bitter, too.
19:13: After losing the Trial by Stone, Chamberlain, who sadly does not make genius mashups like this one featuring Iggy Azalea and Reba McEntire (because you know Skeksis would love Iggy), is shamed and banished from the castle.
You know, how about we reconfigure our electoral process.
If you lose once, you’re outta here forever.
22:01: Here is the titular dark crystal, which is in the Skeksis’ possession.
It does all kinds of things, like shooting beams of light into their eyes during their weird ritualistic ceremonies and acting as a sort of security camera across all the land.
It reveals to the Skeksis that Jen is on the prowl, which freaks them out.
23:21: Speaking of all-seeing objects that freak me out, here’s an errant eyeball.
26:54: That one eye belongs to Aughra, who is some sort of awful-looking nice lady who explains to Jen some astrology mumbo jumbo.
There’s something to do with the Great Conjunction, which is when the three suns all line up and make everything on this planet totally nuts.
It’s sort of like Mercury going in retrograde, but for puppets.
28:58: Aughra pulls out her Box of Crystals and Jen plays his magic lute to figure out which one came from the Dark Crystal.
This is when I realized what I hate this movie: there is no singing or Bowie, just magic lutes and crystals.
34:30: And here is when I realized that I love this movie: FIZZGIG.
There’s another Gelfling, and it’s a girl.
This is very convenient, considering how procreation works.
Jen and Kira sittin’ in a tree, et cetera.
46:30: While Jen was raised by Mystics, Kira was raised by Podlings, who throw one hell of a party.
Meanwhile, Jen explains his quest to Kira — something about a prophecy that speaks of a Gelfling healing the world with the crystals or something or other.
The plot is getting complicated and I just like watching dancing puppets.
53:21: The Gelflings apparently were into hieroglyphics, and here’s where the prophecy was foretold.
54:31: Chamberlain shows up and is like, “Hey, can we be friends.
” And Kira and Jen are like, “Are you kidding.
” Chamberlain, though, seems to be the only one who realizes that it’s possible for the Gelflings to complete their task without killing the Skeksis.
I think this has become an allegory for geopolitical issues, but I really just wish there were more dancing.
56:16: Apparently these things are friendly creatures, and it’s astounding that even the nice things in this mixed-up world are fucking terrifying.
56:40: Kira tells Fizzgig he can’t come with them to the Skeksis’ castle, and he throws the most adorable temper tantrum I’ve ever seen.
1:02:32: Apparently lady-Gelflings have wings.
” Jen says, all bummed out about it.
“Of course not,” Kira replies, “you’re a boy.
” Whoa, Kira, let’s cool it with the gender binary.
Boys should be able to have wings if they want.
(I mean, “Jen” isn’t the most masculine name.
) 1:09:32: In a creepy Clockwork Orange-style torture device, the Skeksis try to extract Kira’s “essence” (ew) so the Skeksis emperor can drink it and be youthful.
Naturally, as Kira has the ability to communicate with all of the animals (sure), she’s freed by the other nice puppets who are trapped in this Skeksis laboratory of horrors.
1:17:33: The Great Conjunction is happening.
(All of the “buts,” “ands,” and “ors” are aligning together, I think.
) 1:21:48: The Skeksis stab Kira and she’s dead.
This is a children’s movie, btw.
1:22:21: Luckily, Jen manages to get the crystal shard into the Dark Crystal before the Great Conjunction happens.
(I can’t believe that is a sentence I just wrote, seriously.
) Then all sorts of magic happens.
(Not to be confused with Crystal Light, but wouldn’t that be tasty.
) 1:25:21: It turns out that the whole point of the prophecy was for the Mystics and the Skeksis to magically combine (in a two-become-one kinda way, if you know what I mean) and become these supreme glowing tree things, which is kinda messed up when you consider that a whole race of Gelflings were entirely wiped out because the Skeksis didn’t know about it.
But hey, they brought Kira back to life, so I guess it’s OK.
1:27:40: And thus, Jen and Kira can live happily ever after and do that two-become-one thing and repopulate the Gelfling race.
Leave it to Jim Henson to make things absolutely terrifying and encouragingly comforting at the end same time.
Final Thoughts: Thank God I never saw this as a kid, because I think I might still be having nightmares about it.
While I was initially dubious and thought it was quite lame (particularly because of the woeful lack of David Bowie’s codpiece), I came around to The Dark Crystal.
It may have not aged super well, especially in a post-LOTR era, but something must be said for a film made entirely with puppets.
Can we get more of those, please.

From the Times Ledger: While most legislators are busy haggling over pre-kindergarten funding and campaign finance reform in the state budget, state Sen.
(D-Howard Beach) has renewed his bid to secure money for Queens nonprofits.
Andrew Cuomo earlier this month and urged him to institute an alternative framework for distributing state funds to community organizations, schools, senior centers and neighborhood projects after the executive curtailed lawmakers’ access to member items in 2010 amid a spate of scandals involving the so-called member items.
The state budget once included a lump sum for generic aid to schools, corporations, municipalities or nonprofits, which legislators would direct to local initiatives.
“I said, ‘Governor, I don’t mind that you took it away from me.
but you never replaced it and now I have senior centers, veterans posts, after-school programs suffering,” Addabbo said, before listing organizations that he once directed funding to that have since closed due to a lack of money, including the Queens Multi-Service Center in Glendale, which provided case management for seniors, and the Forest Park Senior Center.
The senator has reintroduced a bill he drafted last year that would maintain the money once funneled through member items, but continue barring legislators from controlling it by having the state vet organizations and award financing through grant applications.
No senators have signed onto the bill and it does not have a sponsor in the state Assembly.
What does it mean to pursue something that everyone else think is nuts.
And what does it take to succeed.

A video entitled "What Lesbians Think About Bisexuals" went viral earlier this week and the immediate outraged response amongst many people highlighted what appears to be a divide between some lesbian and bisexual women.
HuffPost Live host Alex Berg was joined by several of those women to chat about the controversial topic, including the creator of the aforementioned video, Arielle Scarcella.
In the clip above, Scarcella explains why she wouldn't want to date a bisexual woman -- and it has nothing to do with stereotypes: "Knowing [bisexual women] like dick is a turn off to me because I don't like that, I don't understand it, I don't want to picture them liking it.
So, to me, it has strictly to do with that and nothing to do with the stereotypes attached to it.
I take that as a preference -- I don't think that's bi-phobic in the slightest because it's the same as if I were to say 'I'm not attracted to women with blonde hair and blue eyes,' which I'm not.

From WPIX: The bank robber dubbed the "Holiday Bandit" has been arrested in Queens, federal authorities announced Tuesday.
According to officials, Marat Mikhavlich, the man they believe is behind at least nine bank robberies in the past three months was arrested Tuesday morning, just a day after he allegedly struck again in Edison, New Jersey.
Mikhavlich fled the Cathay Bank in Edison in a stolen 2007 Camry, police said.
The same vehicle was spotted less than 24 hours later parked along 91st Avenue in Queens.
Police moved in and arrested Mikhavlich without incident.
From the NY Post: The heroin-addict bank robber who became one of the most-wanted men in New York for a spree that began around Christmas had grenades inside his Queens home, sources revealed today.
After his arrest, police and FBI agents conducted a search of his Queens apartment on 84th Drive in Kew Gardens and found several grenades, sources told The Post.
From the NY Post: New Yorkers are fleeing the state and city in alarming numbers -- and costing a fortune in lost tax dollars, a new study shows.
5 million state residents left for other parts of the United States from 2000 to 2008, according to the report from the Empire Center for New York State Policy.
It was the biggest out-of-state migration in the country.
The vast majority of the migrants, 1.
1 million, were former residents of New York City -- meaning one out of seven city taxpayers moved out.
What's worse is that the families fleeing New York are being replaced by lower-income newcomers, who consequently pay less in taxes.
Overall, the ex-New Yorkers earn about 13 percent more than those who moved into the state, the study found.
But they will be replaced with a million more vibrant, diverse, low wage workers by 2030.
Doesn't that count for something.
Hey check this out from the NY Post: If he wins a third term, Mayor Bloomberg promised yesterday to transform the city so it'll have the best public schools in the nation by 2013, a far lower crime rate, better mass transit and more waterfront and park options than ever.
Eight days before Election Day, Bloomberg outlined a vision for the future that focused on key projects and quality-of-life initiatives undertaken during his first two terms, from completing the No.
7 subway train to the Far West Side to opening two miles of new parkland along the Manhattan side of the East River.
Yet more parks for Manhattan, eh.

MICHAEL LETWIN, a lawyer living in Brooklyn, went to sign into his Facebook account, as he does almost daily, and received a surprising — and unpleasant — message.
“Your account has been disabled,” it said.
“If you have any questions or concerns, you can visit our F.
Letwin, who besides his personal page also helps administer a Facebook page for the group Jews for Palestinian Right of Return, clicked onto the F.
page and found a reference to Facebook’s community standards, none of which he felt he violated, along with the option to appeal.
Letwin’s situation is not unusual, or new.
The question of what role social media companies should play — a hands-off observer that steps in only in extreme circumstances, or a curator that decides what goes up and what comes down — has long been debated.
Recently, Twitter refused to allow posts with links to videos of the beheading of the American journalist James Foley.
Facebook is involved in a battle with drag queens whose accounts were disabled because they used their stage names in their profiles.
Using anything but your real name is a violation of the company’s rules.
The furor led this week to a meeting with Facebook representatives and a news conference called by a San Francisco supervisor.
“We don’t realize how ingrained Facebook is in our everyday lives,” a drag queen named Heklina told KNTV in San Jose, Calif.
“I was shut out of Facebook for 24 hours and felt like I had a limb chopped off.
” But few users, until they are faced with a similar situation, are aware of how little control they actually have over something they view as their own — their pages, their posts, their photos.
“When Facebook makes a termination decision, it’s potentially life-altering for some people,” said Eric Goldman, a professor of law at Santa Clara University in California and co-director of the High Tech Law Institute there.
“They’re cut off to access to their communities” and possibly to their clients.
That is not to say that Professor Goldman thinks social media platforms should be completely unregulated.
And, he said, Facebook and other social media companies largely do a good job of monitoring so many users and posts.
His and others’ main criticism focuses on transparency.
“The average person’s soapbox is now digital, and we’re now in a world where the large social media companies have a governmentlike ability to set social norms,” said Lee Rowland, a staff lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union.
“It’s a massive power and it comes with a responsibility.
” These questions arise with all social media, but the relationship users have with Facebook is particularly passionate, Professor Goldman said.
Even as some say its impact is waning, it still provides 1.
3 billion people — compared, say, to Twitter’s 271 million active monthly users — with access to news about their friends and to community groups.
“Our goal has always been to strike an appropriate balance between the interests of people who want to express themselves and the interests of others who may not want to see certain kinds of content,” Monika Bickert, head of Facebook’s global policy management, wrote in an email.
Social media companies have every legal right to take down content or kick someone off, said Danielle Citron, a professor of law at the University of Maryland School of Law.
Facebook, like other social media companies, has a list of standards that users agree to abide by when they set up their accounts, even if they never read the standards.
Among other things, they prohibit posting of hate speech (which means individuals or groups cannot attack others based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability or medical condition), encouragements of self-harm, graphic content or threats of violence.
And the user’s real name must be used.
Anyone can easily file a report against a user.
And Facebook has hundreds of people working globally, around the clock and in 30 languages, reading and responding to reports of violations.
Obviously, many of these categories are open to interpretation.
Breast-feeding, for example, is something Facebook has grappled with in the past — essentially, how much of the breast can you show before it becomes graphic.
If Facebook decides to remove content, it sends a warning to the user about the action.
People can also be locked out temporarily for a few days or a week.
Grounds for immediately disabling an account include using a fake name or promoting child exploitation.
But Heather Dorsey, who lives in Milwaukee, had not done any of those things when she found herself barred from logging onto Facebook three years ago.
“My profile didn’t break any rules.
I hadn’t done anything out of the ordinary prior to getting temporarily kicked off,” she wrote in an email.
“It was frustrating not knowing how long it was going to take to get the issue resolved, as I do use Facebook to stay connected, particularly with friends and relatives who live out of town.
I am a freelance writer and social media consultant, so it was also an issue for my work.
” She tried to call, but ended up in an endless circle of recordings.
She found an email address for advertisers and contacted it, asking what she had done wrong.
And as suddenly as she was taken off, she was allowed back on.
In 2012, the website Gawker published a far more detailed list of Facebook’s Abuse Standards Violations used by the company’s regulators.
Facebook refused to confirm that the list was valid.
While the community standards are global, the company does obey a country’s laws.
For example, visually or verbally insulting Turkey’s first president, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, is illegal in Turkey.
If Facebook is notified of such a post, it limits the visibility of that post in Turkey.
The same with Holocaust denial in countries where that is against the law.
Facebook would not release the number of reports it receives nor how much content it takes down.
But it does not take more than a quick search on the Internet to see that many users are confounded when they try to log in and find they cannot.
That includes the American Civil Liberties Union.
The organization last year posted a photo of a bare-chested bronze female statue in an article on its Facebook page about controversial public art in Kansas.
Facebook took the post down, telling the organization that it had violated Facebook’s community standards.
from posting for 24 hours, contending it had posted again, which it had not.
contacted Facebook’s public policy manager, apologies were given and the post was allowed back up.
Rowland said, “Our ultimate success is cold comfort for anyone who has a harder time getting their emails returned than does the A.
” Professor Citron, author of “Hate Crimes in Cyberspace,” said of Facebook, “I think it’s a positive thing that they’re allowed to set community norms.
” The problem is a lack of “technological due process,” she said.
Bickert of Facebook acknowledged that “one area where we’re focusing is improving the information we share with people about our community standards and when we take action on reported content.
Letwin, that can’t come soon enough.
A month after his account was disabled, he received an email apologizing, saying it had all been a mistake on Facebook’s part.
A Facebook spokesman said a report was filed against Mr.
Letwin for using a fake name, which he had not done, and a reviewer looking at his account then mistakenly thought it violated Facebook’s standards regarding promotion of violence and terrorism.
But the process took far longer than it should have, he acknowledged, saying that typically, an appeal should be responded to within a few days.
“It was a Kafkaesque thing,” Mr.
“You don’t know if you did too many posts, too many likes.
The rules are constantly changing.
National support for legalized marijuana has slipped by seven percentage points in the past year, from 51 percent in 2013 to 44 percent today, according to the Public Religion Research Institute.
PRRI asked 4,500 Americans about the intensity of their support for or opposition to legalizing marijuana.
The year-over-year drop in overall support was concentrated among those who favored marijuana legalization last year, but not strongly.
Opposition increased greatest among those who strongly opposed legal marijuana.
These numbers suggest that people who only slightly supported legalization last year have changed their minds, and that people who slightly opposed legalization now feel more strongly about it.
They could augur difficulties for marijuana legalization measures on the ballot this year in Alaska and Oregon.
An August PPP poll found Alaska voters closely divided on the marijuana question, with 44 percent in favor of legalization and 49 percent opposed.
A June SurveyUSA poll found more robust support for legalization in Oregon, at 51 to 41.
An October 2013 Gallup poll found strong support for marijuana legalization nationally, with 58 percent in favor and 39 percent opposed.
The PRRI and Gallup numbers are not directly comparable, since the questions were worded differently in each survey.
Moreover, survey responses on marijuana legalization tend to be highly sensitive to particular question wording.
Still, the year-over-year drop within this one poll is significant and well outside the poll's 1.
If other surveys show similar findings, it could mean that Americans generally don't like the news coming out of Colorado and Washington - even if that news has been largely positive.

Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson (28) talks with reporters at the end of an NFL organized team activity at the Vikings football practice facility in Eden Prairie, Minn.
(AP Photo/Andy Clayton-King) | ASSOCIATED PRESS Programs benefiting from Adrian Peterson's charity are suffering because of the recent accusations of child abuse against the NFL star.
The All Day Foundation, the football player's charitable organization that supports various causes, went offline Tuesday citing an influx of "media inquiries.
" The foundation's Facebook page was also deactivated, ESPN reported.
On Wednesday, the Minnesota Vikings placed Peterson on the Exempt/Commissioner's Permission list -- which bars him from all team activities -- until his legal proceedings have been resolved.
The star running back had been indicted by a grand jury on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child regarding his own son, ESPN reported.
On Saturday, Peterson had turned himself in to Texas authorities.
The Adrian Peterson All Day Foundation website is temporarily offline to allow its charity partners to continue focusing on their outstanding community efforts rather than responding to the numerous media inquiries.
The Foundation will continue to support the various philanthropic causes that Adrian and his family care so deeply about.
The foundation supports various programs that benefit at-risk children, according to promotional material for a summer event supporting the organization.
It places particular focus on programs that empower young girls, as well as on the communities and institutions that supported Peterson earlier in his career.
Darren Rovell, ESPN Sports Business reporter, said the charity has done all it can to protect itself and that what happens next is dependent on legal and NFL proceedings.
"When a namesake on a charity doesn't have a positive connection, people simply aren't going to donate," Rovell said.
"And then it's up to the athlete himself to pump money into it, and often that doesn't happen.

Eight workers were seriously injured in a construction accident while working on a decrepit Brooklyn building Wednesday afternoon, officials and witnesses said.
The men fell from the third floor to the first floor of 1916 Prospect Place about 1 p.
, Fire Department officials said.
Some of the injured were taken to Kings County Hospital, a department spokesman said.
None of the injuries appeared to be life-threatening.
One neighbor said he warned the men that the structure was unsound on their way in.
"I saw a few guys go in, and I remember telling them, 'Be careful because the building is unstable," said Emanuel Kerns, 49, who lives next-door.
"Later, I saw a guy running out to get his cellphone from his car to call 911.
" Rescuers were searching the rubble for any additional victims, officials said.
Leslie Barker, 46, another next-door neighbor, saw the injured being treated by paramedics.
"A lot of men were laying on the ground," she said.
They were taken out of the building.
The camouflage military truck parked idly on 78th Street in Howard Beach belongs to resident Paul Marcel, a volunteer EMS worker, who used the large vehicle to rescue 120 neighbors from their homes that were rapidly filling with water during Hurricane Sandy.
The Forum Newsgroup ran a story in the July 10 issue detailing residents’ concerns with an abandoned army truck parked on 78th Street for several months without being moved.
The owner reached out soon after to tell his story.
After buying the vehicle just days before the storm from a friend who had it shipped over from Afghanistan, Marcel said he started listening to his police scanner and preparing for the worst as the storm began barreling up the east coast.
When Sandy struck, the first emergency situation he responded to included an ambulance that became stuck in the water and needed to be pulled out.
When he heard the call for help on the police scanner, Marcel said he rushed to the vehicle and had the medical personnel get into the truck.
On 92nd Street, a man swam up to the vehicle and asked Marcel if he could save his family because they were standing on furniture inside their home as water was rushing in.
Marcel got the family, including their pet bird, onto the truck safely and brought them to a shelter on Cross Bay Boulevard.
“We went back [into the storm] nine times, and every time we went in, we got about 10 people out,” Marcel said.
“Usually when we were rescuing people, their neighbors wanted to be pulled out too.
” Despite an appearance on Anderson Cooper Live shortly after the storm, Marcel said he received little recognition in the community for his efforts.
The truck was hit repeatedly by large waves during his Hurricane Sandy rescue missions, causing damage to the radiator and the central tire inflation system, which keeps air in the truck’s tires.
He said the truck is properly registered and hopes it will not be towed while he works on getting it up and running again.
“I have used it since Sandy, but it has been acting up like crazy,” Marcel said.
“That is why it has been sitting there on the block like that.
I was trying to fix it every week.
” But Marcel’s efforts have not been forgotten by some of the residents he brought to safety during the hurricane.
Biago Fortunato, 32, lives on 99th Street and jumped into the truck with his family when he saw Marcel driving down the street.
Fortunato, his girlfriend and their dog were present for a couple of Marcel’s rescues before being taken to a shelter on 155th Street.
People were screaming, babies crying, helicopters overhead, it was like something out of a movie,” Fortunato said.
Angela Lanzieri, 25, said by the time Marcel got to her home, the entire first floor was already flooded.
He trudged through five feet of water with down power lines nearby to bring her and her family to safety, Lanzieri said.
“He was tremendously helpful, it was a very scary situation,” Lanzieri said.
“It seemed like he was doing everything he can to help anyone.

From the NY Times: The City University of New York School of Law trains students to be public interest lawyers — the kind who battle bureaucracies and fight injustice.
The CUNY School of Law is to buy space at 2 Court Square in Long Island City, Queens.
But now, some of its teachers and students are taking aim at their own administration.
At issue is the school’s plan to move from its current home, a former junior high school in Flushing, Queens, to a newer, sleeker building in Long Island City that Citigroup completed in 2007.
Last year, CUNY announced plans to buy six floors of the building, with about 260,000 square feet, for $155 million, or about $600 per square foot.
That is more than the price paid for some office space in Manhattan last year, where 11 large buildings were sold.
Their prices averaged $397 per square foot, said Robert Knakal of Massey Knakal Realty Services, a brokerage firm.
The law school deal, which has not yet closed, has aroused the ire of some students and faculty members.
The student government passed a resolution last month demanding that the CUNY administration explain how the price was determined.
In their resolution, they demanded that CUNY explain the purchase “in a manner other than by mere comparison with the $250 million projected cost of construction of a new building.
Weinshall, a former city transportation commissioner, declined to be interviewed.
Asked for a copy of the draft appraisal, Michael Arena, a CUNY spokesman, said it would be released “upon completion of the sale.
” A spokesperson for Citigroup would not answer questions about the deal with CUNY other than to say the company was “working toward an April close.
” In addition to the cost, some at the law school are worried that the deal will change the nature of the only publicly financed law school in New York City, a school known for its dedication to social justice and its rejection of corporate culture.
Sounds like another developer bailout to me.
In their latest book, Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner cite several examples of people who trick guilty parties (i.
those who prey upon people who are ignorant and/or gullible) into unwittingly revealing their guilt through their own behavior.
Here are three examples: o Two women appealed to King Solomon, both claiming to be the mother of a newborn.
Unable to decide, he ordered the child to be cut in half and divided equally.
He knew immediately that the other woman who begged him to let the other have the child was in fact its mother.
o Rock star David Lee Roth of the Van Halen group has a 53-page list of technical and security requirements.
One in the Munchies section specifies "M&Ms (WARNING: ABSOLUTELY NO BROWN ONES).
" Immediately upon arrival, he checks the jar.
"If he saw brown ones, he knew the promoter hadn't read the rider [to the otherwise standard contract) -- and that 'we had to do a serious line check' to make sure that the most important details hadn't been botched either.
" o So-called "Nigerian scammers" send millions of email messages each month to millions of people throughout the world.
(It's called the "Nigerian scam" because more than half of the messages invoke Nigeria than all of the other emails combined.
) I have received 3-5 each week in recent years.
The "Beloved friend" message is always illiterate and ludicrous.
According to Levitt and Dubner, the Nigerian scammers know that almost everyone who receives a message will ignore it.
But if only one in a hundred recipients provides the requested bank information.
"The ridiculous-sounding Nigerian emails seem to be quite good at getting the scammers' massive garden to weed itself.
" Those who think like a freak have mastered that skill.
Some people use it to prey upon people who are ignorant and/or gullible.
Others use it to identify predators.
In Think Like a Freak, Levitt and Dubner develop in much greater depth -- and with a few unexpected wrinkles -- some of the core concepts examined in Freakonomics and SuperFreakonomics: 1.
Incentives are the cornerstones of modern life.
Knowing what to measure, and how to measure it, can make a complicated world less so.
The conventional wisdom is often wrong.
Correlation does not equal causality.
Here's another: One of the keys to success in life (however defined) is knowing what is worth leaving behind, and what is not.
This probably what Don Schlitz had in mind when compositing the lyrics for his song, The Gambler: "You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away, know when to run.
" And another, referred to earlier: "Teach your garden to weed itself.
" Be sure to check out the discussion of the $2,000 bonus that Zappos offers to everyone who completes (and is paid to complete) a rigorous training program.
(See Pages 128-130 and 150-152.
) These are among dozens of other observations by Levitt and Dubner (and one by Isaac Newton) that also caught my eye: o When attempting a penalty kick in soccer -- "protecting your own reputation by not doing something foolish -- you are more likely to kick toward a corner.
Sometimes in life, [however], going straight up the middle is the boldest move of all.
" Although "the percentage of success for a shot at the middle is significantly more likely to succeed, only 17 percent of kicks are aimed there.
" The Freak mindset knows and acts upon such percentages.
(Page 7) o "It has long been said that the three hardest words to say in the English language are [begin italics] I love you [end italics].
For most people, it is much harder to say [begin italics] I don't know [end italics].
That's a shame, for until you can admit what you don't yet know, it's virtually impossible to learn what you need to.
" (20) o "Thinking like a Freak means you should work terribly hard to identify and attack the root cause of problems" rather than waste time and effort responding to symptoms of those problems.
(66) o Isaac Newton: "To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age.
Tis much better to do a little with certainty and leave the rest for others than come after than to explain all things by conjecture without making sure of anything.
" (89) "Have fun, think small, don't fear the obvious -- these are all childlike behaviors that, according to us at least, an adult would do well to hang on to.
" (100) Note: Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) once observed that he spent all of his adult life struggling to see the world again like a child.
I am also reminded of advice provided by Robert Fulghum in All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten: Share everything, Play fair, Don't hit people, Put things back where you found them, Clean up your own mess, Don't take things that aren't yours, Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody; When you go out in the world, watch out for traffic, hold hands, and stick together; and Be aware of wonder.
o On the Smile Train's "once-and-done" option to donors: "There is one more factor that made one-and-done successful, a factor so important -- subtle and powerful at the same time -- that we believe it is the secret ingredient to make any incentive work, or at least work better.
The most radical accomplishment of once-and-done is that it [begin italics] changed the frame of the relationship between the charity and the donor [end italics].
" (124-125) When concluding their book, Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner observe, "Now that we've arrived at these last pages, it's pretty obvious: quitting is at the very core of thinking like a Freak.
Or, if that word still frightens you, let's think of it as 'letting go.
' Letting go of the conventional wisdoms that torment us.
Letting go of the artificial limits that hold us back -- and of the fear of admitting what we don't know.
Letting go of the habits of mind that tell us to kick into the corner of the goal even though we stand a better chance by going up the middle.
" As I read and then re-read these concluding remarks, I was again reminded of observations by Alan Watts in The Book: "We need a new experience -- a new feeling of what it is to be 'I.
' The lowdown (which is, of course, the secret and profound view) on life is that our normal sensation of self is a hoax, or, at best, a temporary role that we are playing, or have been conned into playing -- with our own tacit consent, just as every hypnotized person is basically willing to be hypnotized.
The most strongly enforced of all known taboos is the taboo against knowing who or what you really are behind the mask of your apparently separate, independent, and isolated ego.
" Decades ago, I realized that most human limits are self-imposed, and, that it takes great courage to learn who we are (who we REALLY are) and accept it, then summon the courage needed to become the best person we can possibly be.

Considered to be the personification of the folk rock genre, James Taylor has been writing songs and singing tunes since the late 1960s.
Breaking into the scene with his hit single “Fire and Rain,” Taylor has been the recipient of numerous awards in the folk, pop and country music arenas.
Since his recording of a classic Carole King song rose to number one on the charts in 1971, James Taylor tickets have been a hot commodity.
With a music career that spans more than a quarter of a decade and is dotted with one Grammy Award after another, Taylor is truly a folk rock legend.
Having collaborated with legendary household names George Harrison, Paul McCartney, Carole King, Bonnie Raitt and Stevie Wonder it is apparent that Taylor has reached that indelible legendary status himself.
As well as being a music talent, Taylor has also proven his worth on the Broadway scene.
Two songs from his 1979 album Flag were incorporated into a musical in which Taylor belted out his own tunes on stage.
The peaks and valleys of Taylor’s career have seen him pull out ahead with a massive comeback in the late 1990s that continues to present day.
The best thing about a live James Taylor concert is that the show is great for the whole family.

HIGHLIGHT is pleased to present “new paintings and not so new” by the American poet and painter Rene Ricard.
In this exhibition, numerous works created over the past decade by Ricard are presented.
The paintings consist of oil on linen with hand-painted poems in Ricard’s signature font over “poison green” canvasses and over figurative paintings taking inspiraton from various photographic sources.
Many of the paintings are stylistically neoclassical and, when combined with the poetry, they are at once humorous, witty, historical, confessional and evocative.
Ricard has served as mentor, muse, inspiration and critic for the New York City art scene for the past four decades.
He has been one of America’s most controversial arbiters of taste.
He was a leading figure of Andy Warhol’s Factory, appearing in such Warhol classics as the “The Kitchen” and “Chelsea Girls.
” He is also an accomplished poet, with several volumes in his name including the DIA Art Foundations inaugural publishing, “Rene Ricard 1979-1980.
” In 1981, he wrote the cover article “Radiant Child” in Art Forum magazine, and he since then has been credited in helping Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring transform from underground figures to art stars.
Since the 1980′s, Ricard has been the subject of paintings, photographs and films by Francesco Clemente, Julian Schnabel, Nan Goldin, David Armstrong and Dash Snow.

-- Years ago, it was private homes that began flying flags to mark almost anything -- a change in season, a family member's birthday, a tribute to a hobby.
These days, businesses on Staten Island are getting into the act.
And nowhere is this more obvious than in Stapleton on a stretch of Bay Street that extends roughly from Wave Street to Canal Street.
In fact, Wave Street itself is all a-flutter -- from the billiards parlor at the intersection of Front Street and Wave, to the car wash at the corner of Bay and Wave streets.
Merchants say the street-side banners, which are placed outside when businesses open and taken down when they close for the night, are a way to distinguish themselves and grab a passerby's attention.
"Here in New York, people don't see displays.
You have to tell them," said Ali Akram, an employee at Easy Mart, 586 Bay St.
Akram, originally from Pakistan, admitted that the streetside banners have become "a trend.
Sam Bari, owner of Bari Pizza, at 596 Bay St.
In fact, he claims he was the first in the area to post banners outside his shop.
"People see it when they're driving; they see the flag," he said, noting that without that extra cue, the awning that bears the pizzeria's name might not be enough in today's competitive environment.
Other stores that have bought into the trend in this neck of the Staten Island include Canal Alarm & Security on Canal Street, which specializes in wireless electronics and mobile equipment and Elite Wireless Electronics at 540 Bay St.
On a windy day, this stretch of roadway literally seems to billow.
And that has Akram wondering a bit at how great an advertising advantage these banners really are since so many shops have them.
"It's very minor," in his opinion, he said, looking out at Easy Mart's flags, which advertise mattress and furniture sales.
The shop does sell these items, but it also carries much more -- everything from school supplies to kitchen appliances and electronics.
"All I know is it's my duty to put the flags out in the morning and bring them in at night," he said with a smile.

LEAD: Following is the transcript of President Bush's news conference here today as provided by the Federal News Service: OPENING STATEMENT.
As it has for decades, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week released its annual National Health Interview Survey on the health of Americans.
But this year, there was a difference: For the first time, the respondents were asked about their sexual orientation.
Of 34,557 adults ages 18 and older, the survey reported, 1.
6 percent said they were gay or lesbian.
Some critics say the numbers are low, but they fall in the range of other surveys.
In the new survey, however, only 0.
7 percent of respondents described themselves as bisexual; other studies have reported higher numbers.
Adults who identified themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual reported some different behaviors and concerns — for example, more alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking — than those who said they were straight.
But it can be difficult to elicit information that many people consider private.
The New York Times spoke about such challenges with Gary J.
Gates, a demographer at the Williams Institute at the U.
School of Law, which focuses on law and policy issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity.
Gates’s findings were echoed in the new survey.
This interview was edited and condensed.
Survey takers had a computer that guided them through questions which they asked the respondent in person, and they used flash cards to show them potential answers.
Why do you think the figure for bisexuality was lower than in other surveys.
There is evidence that bisexuals perceive more stigma and discrimination than gay and lesbian people.
They are much less likely to tell important people around them that they are bisexual.
The way this survey was conducted, the stigma experienced by bisexuals may have mattered more in their reluctance to tell the survey takers than it did for gay and lesbian people.
If it were an anonymous interaction by phone or Internet, the stigma might not be as important.
did report that bisexuals reported high levels of psychological distress.
Were there other weaknesses in the survey.
They measured sexual orientation: straight, gay, lesbian or bisexual.
But they didn’t measure gender identity.
They didn’t ask, “Are you transgender.
” or “Do you present your gender differently than the sex that was recorded on your birth certificate.
You have written about best practices for surveying L.
It depends on what question you want answered.
When we ask about sexual orientation, we say, “Do you think of yourself as gay, straight or bisexual.
” But you might want to focus on sexual behavior and health risk.
Then you get a very different group than when you measure people’s sexual identity.
In some surveys, two-thirds of those who say that they have had some same-sex sexual encounters would identify as heterosexual.
I don’t take a stand on whether they are, just that they reported same-sex behavior.
So how people identify themselves to survey takers reflects just that.
, a little over 2 percent identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual.
That’s different than saying a little over 2 percent of the population is lesbian, gay or bisexual.
Some critics say that such efforts do not capture minority communities, where there may be resistance to complying with government survey takers.
There isn’t much difference in the racial and ethnic characteristics of the straight population and the L.
There is a popular conception that there is a lower willingness to report L.
identities among minorities, but very few surveys find that to be the case.
I don’t want my words to ever be construed that I don’t believe there is some portion of the population who is unwilling to disclose their identities to survey takers.
But that’s a largely unknowable number, because you’re asking how many didn’t do something.
Conversely, are there some groups who will disclose more readily than others.
In the Gallup data I’ve worked with, if you’re under 30, 6 percent identify as L.
If you’re older, it’s closer to 3 percent.
But it’s not that proportionally there are more L.
people among the young, but that young people are more likely to disclose.
Said responded, “I don’t know the answer” or something else.
Thirty percent said they hadn’t figured out their sexual orientation.
Another 30 percent said they didn’t understand the words gay, straight or lesbian.
And 30 percent just refused to answer the question or reiterated, “Don’t know.
” How can survey takers obtain more reliable numbers.
We get accurate responses from people who are willing to identify.
Is that accurate in terms of this almost existential thing we call sexual orientation.
There are people who internally think of themselves that way who are not willing to tell the survey taker.
But some surveys then ask, “Who have you told about your sexual orientation.
” And a small number respond, “No one.
” So there are people who will just identify themselves to a survey taker but to no one else in their life.
My argument is that these surveys are accurate portraits of who is willing to disclose in that setting, but it’s not an accurate assessment of, for lack of a better word, the closet.
From the Daily News: The race for the borough's top elected office has become a battle over who is more in touch with the 99%.
Front-running Democrat Melinda Katz and Republican challenger Tony Arcabascio are seizing the imagery and ideology of the Occupy Wall Street movement in hopes of winning a seat that has little to do with fixing America's ongoing imbalance between rich and poor.
The odd debate started earlier this month when Katz sent out a campaign fundraising letter saying “as long as there's a Republican running to be the next Queens Borough President, fighting to make life easier for the 1% while working families struggle, our work is not yet finished.
” That set the mild-mannered Arcabascio, whose parents were immigrants from Italy, into a fury first unleashed during a Facebook rant.
“How dare you sit in your lily white castle in Forest Hills, that you are always sure to mention, while many residents of Queens struggle not just to live and eat but to survive the corruption of people that have defied their will such as you,” he said.
100 days not withstanding, I guess we have crossed a threshold of sorts as the journalists and pundits have had time to digest and produce reportage and analysis on the 2008 election.
The irrepressible Richard Wolffe, of Newsweek and MSNBC, has a new book on the campaign coming out shortly that includes some choice nuggets.
No matter where you were early in the primary period, if you were a Dem, by the fall, everyone was boarding the Hope Express.
Wolffe's book shows, that was not always the case.
One choice nugget from the book that should bring back memories from the primary campaign: Rendell Drinks The Obama Kool-Aid — Literally After Obama locked up the nomination, Pennsylvania Gov.
and ardent Clinton supporter Ed Rendell got a note from an Obama supporter attached to a can of Kool-Aid telling him to drink up.
So the next day at a Philadephla fundraiser for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, the ever-demonstrative governor poured it into a glass of water and proclaimed: "Now I feel that Senator Obama is the most wonderful person ever to have lived in the United States of America.
The smartest, most sensitive most decent and honorable man.
Now I understand what you guys have been feeling for the last six months.

Their first game against the Toronto Maple Leafs was a glimpse into the team’s future as they lost 4-2.
Two years was all that the team had in Missouri due to mounting debt and the inability to sell tickets in an economic downturn.
In 1976 the team got a new start as the Colorado Rockies, though several losing seasons and managerial instability continued to impact the team’s performance.
After six years the team was sold and relocated to the East coast where they would be playing against powerhouses like the New York Islanders and the New York Rangers.
The team was named after the tale of the Jersey Devil, a creature that inhabits and haunts the Pine Barrens of South Jersey.
Their first game in their new East coast home was played against the Pittsburgh Penguins, resulting in a 3-3 draw.
While it may have taken a few years for the Devils to find their footing, once they got it they were relentless.
The team has garnered over a dozen conference and division championship titles combined as well as several Stanley Cup Finals victories.
With the only honor eluding the team being the Presidents' Trophy, New Jersey Devils tickets are a must for hockey aficionados and nonfans alike.
From the NY Times: Most New York City residents do not lack for access to some form of public transit.
And advocates are always extolling the virtues of subway, bus, rail or ferry over sitting — and stewing — in gridlock inside a car.
But while public transit might be preferable when it comes to controlling stress, driving is still the fastest way to get to and from work.
At least that’s what a recent Census Bureau survey found.
The mean travel time for public transportation riders was more than 47 minutes, compared with under 32 minutes for people who drove themselves and 37 minutes for people who car-pooled.
One-third of mass transit riders spent an hour or more commuting, according to the 2011 American Community Survey released by the census this month.
Driving has been a quicker way to get to work for New Yorkers than public transit for several years.

When the ebola crisis first struck West Africa, China was among the only major powers to not only keep its personnel in the affected countries but to also send tens of millions of dollars in badly needed aid.
, by contrast, was visibly absent.
That is, until President Barack Obama announced the deployment of 3,000 U.
military personnel on top of $175 million in other assistance.
Now, critics are accusing China of not doing enough given its outsized economic presence in West Africa.
Sure, China is now Africa’s largest trading partner but given its own status as a developing country, is it fair to compare the U.
and Chinese responses to the ebola crisis.
CINCINNATI — The psychologist Lynda Crane found that of the many injuries inflicted by schizophrenia, the greatest could be the pain of being forgotten.
Just naming the illness somehow erased the person, something she learned when her 18-year-old son’s doctors said he had schizophrenia.
Six years later, he committed suicide.
“It took me a long time to come to terms with it,” Dr.
“Even I had a hard time understanding it, how this bright man, with a brilliant future, could suffer like this.
One thing I learned was that as soon as you mentioned the word, people stopped seeing the person.
They just saw the diagnosis and a collection of symptoms.
Crane, a professor at the College of Mount St.
Joseph in the western hills of Cincinnati, sought a way to enlighten her students and others about the ordinary people who live with schizophrenia despite its extraordinary burdens – the confused thinking, the delusions, the hallucinations, the anxiety and fear.
Then she discovered a tool more commonly used among sociologists and anthropologists: oral history.
Employing the device to examine schizophrenia has shifted her own perspective about a disease she thought she knew well.
“People with schizophrenia do not lose their individuality, even when the illness is very severe,” Dr.
“What I discovered through oral history is that it’s not about schizophrenia.
It’s about a complexity of life that is very hard to get at any other way.
” For the past three years, on their own time and with no outside money, Dr.
Joseph psychologist, Tracy McDonough, have built the Schizophrenia Oral History Project.
Other oral history collections have focused on diseases like AIDS or leprosy, but this is the first to focus on schizophrenia, they say.
So far they have recruited two dozen people to sit down with them and a voice recorder, asking their “narrators” simply: What’s it like to be you.
“The real beauty of this project,” says Dr.
McDonough, “comes out of the fact that Lynda and I really try not to ask a lot of questions.
The narrators want to tell their stories.
Many of them have told us that no one has ever asked them about their lives before.
” The psychologists began the project by alerting local mental-health organizations that they were looking for participants willing to volunteer directly.
“We didn’t want the providers to make the call because that can create a sense of, ‘I have to do this because my therapist wants me to,’” Dr.
“So each of the narrators had to take the initiative.
” One participant, Shirley Austin, 47, lives by herself on the west side of Cincinnati with her terrier, Fluffy.
After a nightmarish childhood of violence and sexual abuse, Ms.
Austin learned as a teenager that she had schizophrenia, and she says that even though she takes her medication, has relatives nearby and attends a church, she wrestles with loneliness.
When her therapist told her about the oral history project, she was curious.
“Not even my therapists have ever asked me about my life that much,” Ms.
“I felt like I got strength and courage talking about what happened to me.
I want to tell all the teenaged girls to be strong, that I’m a survivor, and they can be, too.
McDonough have delivered more than 30 talks about the project in the Cincinnati area, visiting schools and local groups and collecting responses.
“I like to think of myself as open-minded, but the Schizophrenia Oral History Project helped me see that I was stigmatizing patients,” said Vicki Cheng, a nursing student at Miami University who heard one of the talks.
“I would not have been surprised to learn that a patient with cancer or heart disease loved organic gardening or painting.
Why in the world should I be surprised that someone with schizophrenia has hobbies, too.
” The project has benefited participants, too, like Alice Fischer, 43, who has schizoaffective disorder, a variant of schizophrenia, and lives with her mother and brother in her childhood home in Cincinnati’s Price Hill neighborhood.
Fischer said she had been teased since grade school well into adulthood.
“Even right now, sometimes on the bus, people say mean things to me,” she said.
She jumped at the chance to join the oral history project as one of its first narrators because she says newspapers and television too often communicate the wrong idea about people with mental illness.
Fischer also prodded her brother, who has schizophrenia, to participate in the oral history project, but he resisted, fearful of repercussions from going public with his illness.
The project’s website features Ms.
Fischer’s vivid paintings of owls or hearts or handprints with upbeat messages for world peace.
“I want people to know I’m not dangerous,” she says.
“They don’t know what a nice person I am.
” One of the narrators most gravely affected by schizophrenia is Paul Drake, 49, who for 14 years has lived with a tabby cat named Tiger in a small cluttered apartment on Cincinnati’s west side.
Through his reading, he learned organic gardening to supplement his meager food budget.
He starts tomatoes and other vegetables on his windowsill and grows them on a small plot behind his building.
He has taught his neighbors how to garden.
McDonough have shared with the narrators some of the written responses they’ve received from listeners to the oral history project; one comment for Mr.
Drake said, “I respect Paul’s insights and appreciate his straightforward sharing of how he copes.
Drake says the positive reactions “make me feel good.
” Amid the disorder of his mind, he frames a sentence to describe the impact that his participation has had on him.
“It gives me,” he says, “some immortality.
Crane is retiring from teaching this spring and turning over leadership of the Schizophrenia Oral History Project to Dr.
McDonough, who has been applying for grants to support the work and searching for more narrators.
A few weeks ago, they got a call from Alice Fischer’s brother.
He said he was ready now to tell his story.

BEIRUT, Lebanon — The commander of the Free Syrian Army, whose forces claim to be leading the insurgency but have been overshadowed by the gains of their tactical jihadist allies, has visited the coastal province that is home to President Bashar al-Assad, according to a video circulated by activists on Monday.
Antigovernment fighters who are not part of the Free Syrian Army, many of them from extremist brigades that are linked to Al Qaeda, have recently seized a number of villages in the mountains on the eastern side of Mr.
Assad’s home province, Latakia.
The visit by the Free Syrian Army commander, Gen.
Salim Idris, appeared intended to show that he and his fighters were also involved in the Latakia seizures as part of a new front in the civil war.
In the video, General Idris said that he was visiting the area to see the “accomplishments” of rebels and to rebut accusations that he had ordered fighters to leave the area.
“There were no orders to anyone to withdraw from the battlefield,” General Idris said, wearing a black polo shirt and dark cap, with a pistol holstered under his left arm.
The video did not indicate his precise whereabouts in the province, specify when he was there or provide any other information about the visit.
General Idris’s group was intended to be the moderate pathway for military aid to the Syrian opposition, but he has been increasingly marginalized as aid has remained limited and more radical fighters have grown stronger on the battlefield.
Jihadist groups fighting in Syria now include more than 6,000 foreigners, and they have been pouring into the country at an accelerated pace, according to counterterrorism officials.
Breast cancer is cancer that starts in the tissues of the breast.
There are two main types of breast cancer: In rare cases, breast cancer can start in other areas of the breast.
Breast cancer can be invasive or noninvasive.
Invasive means it has spread from the milk duct or lobule to other tissues in the breast.
Noninvasive means it has not yet invaded other breast tissue.
Noninvasive breast cancer is called "in situ.
" Many breast cancers are sensitive to the hormone estrogen.
This means that estrogen causes the breast cancer tumor to grow.
Such cancers have estrogen receptors on the surface of their cells.
They are called estrogen receptor-positive cancer or ER-positive cancer.
Some women have HER2-positive breast cancer.
HER2 refers to a gene that helps cells grow, divide, and repair themselves.
When cells (including cancer cells) have too many copies of this gene, they grow faster.
In the past, women with HER2-positive breast cancer have a more aggressive disease.
They have a higher risk that the disease will return (recur) than in women who do not have this type.
This may be changing with specifically targeted treatments against HER2.
What We Know The Local Coordination Committee, a network of activist groups in towns across Syria, drew attention to this video on Twitter.
It is one of several posted on Thursday that showed fighting in Inkhel.
The Syrian conflict began as a protest movement sparked by police brutality in Dara'a in March 2011.
What We Don't Know We do not know how many people may have been injured or killed during this battle in Inkhel.
We do not know if any of the residents of the homes seen in this video were present at the time of the fighting.
None of the buildings appeared to be damaged, but we do not know the state of the town now.
This video was one of almost two dozen uploaded to YouTube on Thursday by an account associated with activists in Inkhel that showed different scenes of fighting in the town.
Some appeared to show the same men firing antiaircraft canons from inside a residential neighborhood.
I'm my own person, not just your kid.
Sometimes I might have opinions that differ from yours.
Sometimes I just want to be your baby.
I still want to have fun with you, and feel like home is safe and happy.
I need to make some of my own choices, and maybe some of my own mistakes.
Don't do my work for me or get me out of every jam.
You don't need to be better than me at everything.
Don't condescend; you don't need to impart your elderly wisdom on me if I have a problem.
Please wait for me to ask for your help.
If I don't ask for it, I might want to work it out for myself.
Let me rant without offering advice.
Sometimes that's all I really need, just to talk my way through something and for you to just listen to me.
Sometimes I'm going to be moody and annoyed and frustrated.
You need to just let that happen (though you shouldn't let me be rude to you; that's weird and embarrassing).
It might just be a mood or something might be going on that I'm not ready to talk about yet.
If you hang around doing stuff near me and don't interrupt or try to solve it as soon as I start, I might feel comfortable talking with you about things.
If I don't, you can help me manage my time, but wait until I'm not taking care of responsibilities to think I can't.
Don't just assume I can't handle responsibility because of my age.
It feels really good when you ask me to teach you about what I'm learning or what I'm good at.
You don't have to be awesome at computer programming to let me teach you some cool stuff, for instance.
I have to be a beginner constantly.
Show me it's OK to stay relaxed and present when you are struggling to learn something.
I don't like the drama either, and it surprises me as much as it does you.
You think it's rough having this alien lunatic in your house.
Try having it in your body, and you can't even get away.
If you don't like my friends, it feels like you don't trust my judgment or like I am stupid about choosing friends.
Ask me what I like about them, or what we have fun doing together, or just to tell you about a new friend.
Still, if you think my friends are being bad to me, I need you on my side that much more.
Sometimes I am completely overwhelmed and need to zone out for a while.
I am not becoming a slug and will not stay in my room staring at a screen for the rest of my life.
Maybe just for the rest of the afternoon.
I will fight you every step of the way if you make me do stuff I don't want to do (get some exercise, do my homework, write a thank-you note, practice piano, apologize to my sister, take a shower, wear deodorant.
so many things), but you should probably make me do them anyway.
I know I will feel better if I sweat and shower each day, and develop my study skills, and show up tomorrow prepared, and, and, and.
I might not be able to do what I should right away.
I might need reminders, later, which will annoy me completely.
Explain why I'm being criticized or punished.
It feels scary if I don't understand anything beyond that you are mad at me.
And sometimes what I need more than a scolding is a hug or a cuddle.
Especially when I am more porcupine than puppy.
I need to have private jokes with my friends and not explain them to you.
You don't need to be involved in every aspect of my life to still be loved and needed by me.
If my social life gets to be too much, I may need you to force a little vacation from it on me.
But most of time what I need is to work through how to navigate life online and with peers.
Now is my chance to learn how to deal, with your help.
Just shutting it down keeps me from learning how to build my life online with scaffolding provided by you.
Stay calm and cool, let me explain what's going on, and talk things through with me.
Especially if I've been feeling stressed, maybe you could just hang out with me.
Go to the park or get an ice cream or have a catch, whatever; it feels good to just do something together without discussing or solving or teaching anything.
I like it when you think I'm funny.
I actually do care what you think about me.
Please find something specific you actually like about me because sometimes I can't find anything in myself to like at all.
I might roll my eyes, but your words and judgments do matter to me, and I will remember them, the good and the bad.
I will keep them with me like treasures even when I lose my keys and wallet and ID.
And bonus extra important thing you should know: The fact that my opinions on this and anything else might change tomorrow does not mean I don't feel them fiercely today.
Remind me you still love me, too.

He displays the memento in the yard of his Forest Hills Gardens home.
"The tombstones of fraternal organizations lie throughout Queens, which I suppose is appropriate given the number of graveyards we have," said Haddad, 46.

We don't really blink these days at an actress going the whole mile when it comes to nude scenes.
But something occured to us recently: That beautiful lady baring it on screen is someone's mom.
That notion is both empowering to fellow moms out there, and a little worrisome, when we imagine, say, Halle Berry's kids or Angelina Jolie's brood happening upon their mom's movies.
Here's hoping that when these celebrities' kids are old enough to understand, their mamas give them advance warning of what to watch, and when to shield their eyes.
If you were an actress, would you do a nude scene.
Drug reform advocates hoped that New York Mayor Bill de Blasio would end the city's practice of throwing people in jail for low-level drug offenses.
| Andrew Burton via Getty Images Three years ago, police officers in Seattle took a chance on a radical and unprecedented approach to the city's drug problem: They stopped automatically locking up everyone arrested for drugs and, instead, began referring addicted people to social workers, who provided them with free apartments, referrals to psychiatrists and anything else they needed to get off the streets and off drugs.
This week, New York City announced a plan to adopt a similar strategy -- a change that could have huge reverberations around the country, proponents of Seattle's approach say.
New York, after all, is the nation's media capital and home to more than 10 times as many people as Seattle.
But after news of the plan broke on Monday, supporters of the Seattle program noticed that the New York plan lacks many of the key attributes that made the original experiment so innovative.
Gabriel Sayegh, director of the New York state office of the national Drug Policy Alliance, said that if the city program turns out to be as limited as it appears, "that would not be a step forward for New York.
It would be an incredible step backward.
" The main difference is that Seattle offers its program to people arrested for heroin, crack and all other drugs, while New York will apparently offer its version only to those facing what are known as "violation infractions.
" Hanging out in a park after closing time qualifies as a violation infraction.
So does drinking beer on a stoop or grilling on a sidewalk.
Heroin possession does not, however.
Neither does crack possession, smoking marijuana in public or any other crime involving illegal drugs, with one exception -- possessing pot "in private," an act that, by its very nature, rarely attracts the attention of the authorities.
"You can get arrested for it, but it takes a lot of work and planning," said New York defense attorney Ron Kuby of the latter crime.
"You pretty much have to light up a joint inside of the bar that's hosting the inspector's retirement party.
" A spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which is overseeing the plan, said no one was available for an interview, but she confirmed that New York is only "targeting individuals facing violation infractions.
" That's sure to disappoint anyone who hopes that Mayor Bill de Blasio, a progressive leader with a national profile, will finally end the city's practice of throwing people in jail for low-level drug offenses.
More than 50,000 people were arrested for drugs in New York last year, most of them for acts involving marijuana.
"The de Blasio folks have these interesting ideas about how to try to move away from get-tough law enforcement, but this is a pretty weak step," said Alex Vitale, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College who studies the city's police practices.
Critics point to another key difference between the New York and Seattle programs: In Seattle, drug offenders face a harsh alternative if they don't sign up for the program -- three weeks in jail on average, according to an analysis by the county government.
By contrast, New Yorkers arrested for drinking on the stoop and other violation infractions currently face only about a day in jail -- and that's if they lack ID or provide the police with some other justification for keeping them off the streets.
In fact, the police don't have to arrest people for these offenses at all.
As long as someone isn't causing a public disturbance, the cops will often just write up a ticket.
"There's an easy way for police to keep these people out of jail," said Sayegh, "and that's not to make that arrest.
" Although there's no conclusive data yet on the Seattle program's effectiveness, the effort has helped dozens gain access to services that can temper the effects of addiction, according to records provided by the program for an in-depth Huffington Post investigation.
Santa Fe, New Mexico, now offers a version to people arrested for opiates, and many other cities, from Houston to Denver, have sent representatives to Seattle to take notes.
It's unclear whether New York plans to start small and expand its own version later.
Such a move could do much to quiet the critics, but for now, reformers are scratching their heads over why the city doesn't intend to offer this "incarceration alternative" to people actually facing incarceration, especially those arrested for drug crimes.
"None of this actually makes any sense," Kuby said.

Just ask trumpeter-bandleader-educator Khalil Shaheed, whose informal session work with one of his musical mentors, Jimi Hendrix, was finally heard in 2003 on the PBS program Martin Scorsese Presents the Blues.
The Jimi Hendrix episode features an early recording of a budding Shaheed jamming with the guitar god.
"It was a really, really educational part of my life, to be hanging with Jimi," Shaheed says, by phone from his home in Oakland.
"I was really young at the time, like 19 or 20.
" Shaheed was in Buddy Miles' jazz band for six years and befriended Hendrix through Miles—then drummer for Hendrix's Band of Gypsies.
Buddy's band was living in New York at the Chelsea Hotel right around the time of Electric Ladyland.
"Jimi used to just call me up and say, 'Hey, man, bring a horn section over.
' We'd go over and might be over there for two or three days.
" With the passing earlier this month of Oakland-based jazz pianist Ed Kelly, all three of Shaheed's main musical mentors, including drum master Billy Higgins, are no longer alive.
Shaheed has become a teacher and mentor to countless others.
As the founder and director of the 11-year-old Oaktown Jazz Workshop (OJW), he has brought the world of jazz into many lives and schools.
Performance Workshops are tailored to players 12 to 18 years old, while 45-minute Jazz in the Schools programs introduce music students to the world of jazz and its relationship to the European classical tradition.
Jazz fans will get to hear Shaheed on March 6 as the San Jose Jazz Society presents his quintet as part of its Sunday Jazz Series.
Featuring tenor saxophonist Richard Howell, pianist Glen Pearson, bassist Ron Belcher and drummer Darrell Green, the group is the core of Shaheed's 13-piece Big Belly Blues Band.
"It's like a family thing," he says of one group anchoring the other.
While he's still determining the exact program, he does know it will be of a straight-ahead, post-bop nature.
Another certainty is that lessons he teaches in the classroom are likely to make their way onto the bandstand.
"The one thing I've learned about teaching in 20 and 30 years is that you never quit learning.
By teaching, you learn," he reflects.
"So I may be teaching something to my band and come up with a great idea to use for my professional band.
They interlap, and it's a really great thing, because it keeps it fresh.
" Born in Pittsburgh and raised in Chicago, Shaheed began gigging in high school.
His jazz-nut father would chaperone him to bar dates with established musicians.
He also dressed up with big floppy hats and big coats to sneak into bars to hear groups and meet musicians.
Neither of his parents were musical, but his father took Khalil to concerts by Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Gene Ammons.
After graduating from high school, he attended Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, where he studied composition and performance.
He taught music on the side before moving to the Bay Area, to be near his mother, who had transferred out here for her job with United Airlines.
Attending San Francisco State, he started to gig locally before taking up his gig with Miles.
After the six years of touring with him, he returned to the Bay Area and continued to live and play and teach here.
"I majored in performance and composition.
That tells you right there that my goal wasn't to be a teacher.
And it turns out if I wasn't a teacher right now, I'd be starving to death," he concludes.
" The Khalil Shaheed Quintet performs March 6 at the Palm Room at the Hyatt St.
Claire as part of the Sunday Jazz Series 2005.
The show starts at 3pm and tickets are $17.

Banned Books Week is an annual event celebrating the freedom to read.
Typically held during the last week of September, it highlights the value of free and open access to information.
Banned Books Week brings together the entire book community –- librarians, booksellers, publishers, journalists, teachers, and readers of all types –- in shared support of the freedom to seek and to express ideas, even those some consider unorthodox or unpopular.
By focusing on efforts across the country to remove or restrict access to books, Banned Books Week draws national attention to the harms of censorship.
Check out the frequently challenged books section to explore the issues and controversies around book challenges and book banning.
The books featured during Banned Books Week have all been targeted with removal or restrictions in libraries and schools.
While books have been and continue to be banned, part of the Banned Books Week celebration is the fact that, in a majority of cases, the books have remained available.
This happens only thanks to the efforts of librarians, teachers, students, and community members who stand up and speak out for the freedom to read.
For more information on getting involved with Banned Books Week: Celebrating the Freedom to Read, please see Ideas and Resources, Calendar of Events, and the new Banned Books Week site.
You can also contact the ALA Office for Intellectual Freedom at 1-800-545-2433, ext.
For media inquiries related to Banned Books Week, please contact: Heather Cho, Media Relations Specialist, 312-280-4020, hcho@ala.
Banned Books Week is sponsored by the American Booksellers Association; American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression; the American Library Association; American Society of Journalists and Authors; Association of American Publishers; Comic Book Legal Defense Fund; the Freedom to Read Foundation; National Coalition Against Censorship; National Council of Teachers of English; National Association of College Stores; PEN American Center and and Project Censored.
It is endorsed by the Center for the Book in the Library of Congress.

The official CVS/pharmacy iPhone App puts CVS/pharmacy, MinuteClinic and CVSphoto in the palm of your hand.
Just download our app to “visit” your CVS/pharmacy on the go.
Features include:• Refill, transfer and manage prescriptions• Pill Identifier - easy to use feature helps identify pills based on imprint, shapes and color information• Access your prescription history• Scan to refill and refill without signing in• Find a CVS/pharmacy store and check hours• Shop your weekly ad for deals and create a shopping list• Access your CVS.
com and ExtraCare accounts• Send savings and rewards to card • Create a mobile ExtraCare “card” that can be scanned at most registers and ExtraCare Coupon Centers• Sign up to receive offer-filled emails• Shop CVS.
com on your app• Scan QR codes in store for information and savings• See MinuteClinic locations, services and accepted insurance• Order photos for express pick up• And much more.
Would have given it five but It's incredibly convenient for prescriptions however instead of getting email or mail coupons, the coupons should already be preloaded onto the extra care card/mobile app.
Also, same deal with the coupons given at the end of the receipt.
I get at least 10-15 every time I shop and I never remember to use them (which may be the strategy for CVS-give coupons knowing that nobody will hang on to them and use them) but think about the amount of money that could be saved just by cutting down on extraneous paper usage.
I would venture to say that the money used for receipt paper (which isn't cheap) and paper mailings is a lot more than what CVS would lose if I actually got to use my 20% off coupon or my $2 off a $5 deodorant purchase.
Make this happen ASAP and you guys get my 5 stars.
I removed this app months ago because it was such a hassle to open and then get the app to show my barcode to scan.
I tried it again now after recent updates and very disappointed that there is no Passbook support.
I can just give CVS my phone number in less time it takes to get to the ExtraCare barcode which is the #1 thing I want from this app.
I'll give it another try to see if I get any other benefits of allowing the app to eat up valuable space but I am less likely to use it just because I am annoyed that they can't use an OS feature that is of most use to me.
Handy and useful to always have on hand Reliable and handy, especially to quickly look at the weekly ad.
As for the mobile card, it's usually just quicker to give your phone number to the cashier rather then open up the app get to the mobile card and have your phone scanned.
unless getting it ready was what kept me busy if I had to wait in line lol.
Could use a fresh look, overall it looks outdated and just boring.
but def does the job as convenient all access to your cvs online needs.
From the Queens Courier: Thanks to a 42 to 7 vote by the City Council – and a construction contract that has already been awarded – it seems that the new police academy in College Point is on track.
In fact, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on Tuesday, November 17 that, “the city [can] move forward on constructing a 21st century police academy to train the next generation of New York’s Finest.
we can now break ground on the new building.
” Located at College Point Boulevard and 28th Avenue, the academy is a $1.
5 billion project that will consolidate all of the instruction facilities for new police, school safety and traffic enforcement officers, as well as the continuing education of veterans, on its 30-acre campus.
It will have 250 classrooms, firing ranges, indoor and outdoor tracks and a tactical training village including a simulated subway station.

The Hollywood Reporter addresses the question we've all been wondering since the days of Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica: why do hot, young, rich, famous people live in Calabasas and neighboring Hidden Hills.
Calabasas has just 23,000 residents and a full 84 percent of them (totally made up number) are international pop stars or have had a show on Bravo.
Here's how former Hidden Hills mayor (and producer/entertainment lawyer, of course) David Stanley describes the appeal: "We have no sidewalks or street lights.
People are out walking, the kids gather at the community center to swim and BBQ, and once a year we put on a parade to celebrate the founding of our city -- marching bands and all.
" Which doesn't really explain Justin Bieber's attraction, does it.
(He just bought a house in Calabasas for $6.
THR thinks it might be "the privacy, the safety (even if an inordinate number of houses boast panic rooms anyway) and the value of property vis-a-vis the Westside," not to mention the "well-regarded public Las Virgenes Unified School District.
" And then there's the self-perpetuation factor, or as a Ewing & Associates partner says: "They think, if it's good enough for [those celebrities] to live here.
then it must be good enough for us.
" To that point, we've rarely seen so many bold faced names in a single article (even in The Hollywood Reporter), so for funsies, we thought we'd list them all out.

The treatment you choose will be based on how bad your symptoms are and how much they bother you.
Your doctor will also take into account other medical problems you may have.
If you are over 60, you are more likely to have symptoms.
But many men with an enlarged prostate have only minor symptoms.
Self-care steps are often enough to make you feel better.
If you have BPH, you should have a yearly exam to monitor your symptoms and see if you need changes in treatment.
Alpha 1-blockers are a class of drugs that are also used to treat high blood pressure.
These medicines relax the muscles of the bladder neck and prostate.
Most people who take alpha 1-blockers notice improvement in their symptoms.
Finasteride and dutasteride lower levels of hormones produced by the prostate.
These drugs also reduce the size of the gland, increase urine flow rate, and decrease symptoms of BPH.
You may need to take these medicines for 3 to 6 months before you notice symptoms getting better.
Possible side effects include decreased sex drive and impotence.
Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat chronic prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), which may occur with BPH.
BPH symptoms improve in some men after a course of antibiotics.
Many herbs have been tried for treating an enlarged prostate.
Many men use saw palmetto to ease symptoms.
Some studies have shown that it may help with symptoms, but results are mixed and more research is needed.
If you use saw palmetto and think it works, ask your doctor if you should still take it.
Prostate surgery may be recommended if you have: The choice of a specific surgical procedure is usually based on the severity of your symptoms and the size and shape of your prostate gland.
Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): This is the most common and most proven surgical treatment for BPH.
TURP is performed by inserting a scope through the penis and removing the prostate piece by piece.
Simple prostatectomy: An open prostatectomy is usually performed using general or spinal anesthesia.
An incision is made through the abdomen or perineum (the area behind the scrotum).
Only the inner part of the prostate gland is removed.
The outer portion is left behind.
Most people need to stay in the hospital for 5 to 10 days.
This treatment is most often done on men who have very large prostate glands.
Most men who have prostate surgery have improvement in urine flow rates and symptoms.
Other, less-invasive procedures use heat to destroy prostate tissue.
None have been proven to be better than TURP.
Patients who receive these procedures are more likely to need surgery again after 5 or 10 years.
However, these procedures may be a choice for: In-Depth Treatment ».

With the rumored bombshell NY Times story about the Governor's personal life Missing In Action the Governor is standing tall, calling the rumors "Absolutely false" and stating he has no intention to resign.
Link According to the Associated Press, a spokeswoman for New York Gov.
David Paterson is calling rumors about his personal behavior "absolutely false" and says he will not resign.
Paterson spokeswoman Marissa Shorenstein made the statement Monday.
Rumors around the Capitol and anonymous reports in some media outlets about Paterson's personal conduct come as he considers seeking election later this year.
Many in the Democrat's own party prefer Andrew Cuomo, the more popular and better-financed attorney general.
Paterson became governor in 2008 after former Gov.
Eliot Spitzer resigned amid a prostitution scandal.
When he became governor, Paterson admitted that he and his wife had been unfaithful to each other.
Albany Times Union - No sign" of the Times Article But still the questions swirl around Albany.
The Albany Times Union "Capitol Confidential" column reports that 10 State Troopers asdsigned to the Govenror's security detail have been reassigned, although denials have already been issued that they have anything to do with leaks surrounding the Governor.
Republican Rick Lazio has criticized the Fred Dicker in the NY Post reports that by sitting on their supposed blockbuster of a story for nearly two weeks, the Times' scribes have created a paralytic frenzy in state government the likes of which have never been seen before.
Perhaps they're bucking for the first Pulitzer Prize ever awarded for buzz.
It was left to Paterson's newest chief political ally to offer a, uh, reasoned defense of the embattled Democratic governor, one free of conspiracy theories and bogus enemies.
"If The New York Times is working on or has a story, then you should confirm or print it," Rick Lazio, the all-but-certain Republican candidate for governor, demanded of Times Executive Editor Bill Keller.
"If you do not, then you have a moral obligation to stop the drama and the psychological warfare on Gov.

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are on track to own a $20-million Hidden Hills mansion on land that once belonged to Lisa Marie Presley, according to reports out Wednesday.
With luck, they'll actually make it into this place; an $11-million home purchase in Bel-Air more than 18 months ago turned into a massive build-over project.
The couple, who've been holed up with Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner in Calabasas for more than a year, decided in July that they would flip the Bel-Air place.
Photos of the Hidden Hills estate first went up on TMZ on Wednesday afternoon, with E.
News following moments later with its own confirmation of the in-escrow news.
Kardashian later confirmed that she and her husband were planning to get the heck out of Jenner's place soon, telling People that her move-in date "might be a few months, but I'm not sure.
"We just found a new, amazing place," the reality TV star said, keeping any details to herself.
"They wanted more land than the Bel-Air home, so they are flipping that and will have the two homes now," a source told E.
"But they will sell that and move into Hidden Hills.
" With their daughter North West, the couple will move into the place as-is, a source told Us Weekly.
"They have no plans to tear it down or anything like that.
" Well of course there's no need for a build-over on this joint, because that's already been done.
When Presley owned the property, Hot Property noted, it had about 8,000 square feet of living space, with only five bedrooms and 5.
There was also a one-bedroom guesthouse, an annex/studio with a sound booth and a second-story guest unit, and a three-stall barn with a bedroom and a half-bath on just over 3 acres.
The current residence, completed in 2012 after a doctor had the place razed in 2011, boasts eight bedrooms and 10 bathrooms in 15,667 square feet of living space, according to a listing on Zillow.
The kitchen is big enough for three islands, and the family room, dining room and master suite all feature fireplaces.
Plus there's a 1,050-square-foot "entertaining pavilion," which presumably is a thing used for entertaining.
Because really, one is never enough.
A Google Earth view shows that one of the pools, an irregularly shaped one with a slide, has been retained from the Presley era.
Something old, something new, and all that.
Kardashian had gone on a wordy Twitter tear Tuesday about needing to lose 15 to 20 pounds.
She'll soon have enough rooms at her disposal to make losing just about anything very, very easy.

When you flip open a cookbook called “Fancy Desserts,” you don’t expect to find a photograph of two elephants mating.
You don’t expect to find expletive-peppered punk-rock fliers.
Or an image of sugar being heated up on a spoon like heroin.
Or a recipe for candied carrots in which purple, yellow and orange greenmarket delights are shown lying side by side with a roll of Life Savers and a Zagnut bar.
“This recipe is inspired in part by the Looney Tunes episode where Bugs Bunny buys carrots out of a vending machine,” writes Brooks Headley, the author of “Fancy Desserts,” which will be published in October.
Headley is the pastry chef at Del Posto in Manhattan, the most formal of the restaurants in the Mario Batali empire.
So it might come as a surprise when readers turn to Page 29 and dip into a tribute to the scabrous punk band the Dead Kennedys, followed by a disquisition on the influence of the New Nordic cuisine of Noma in Copenhagen, capped off by a snapshot of two cute green Gummi Bears who seem to be gearing up for hand-to-hand combat.
Oh, and the header at the top of that page.
“Sugared Green Strawberries With Toasted Fennel Cake, Candied Fennel and Mint Gelato.
” Pretty soon a few questions come to mind: Who is this Brooks Headley person, and how did he ever get a job at a four-star restaurant.
(And is he the same fellow who’s behind Superiority Burger, that veggie-burger pop-up that had hungry customers clogging a New York sidewalk.
Headley, who is 42 and having something of a moment in New York food circles, might be even more taken aback by his circumstances than you are.
Although he won a national James Beard award last year for Outstanding Pastry Chef, he doesn’t think of himself as a pastry chef.
“He doesn’t even like that term,” said Mark Ladner, the executive chef at Del Posto.
Those rococo, spun-sugar, Mousetrap-style sculptures that look like candied swans and vampire castles and space stations.
The ones that shatter into thousands of heartbreaking pieces in the documentary “Kings of Pastry”.
“I don’t know how to do that,” Mr.
Thus the winking irony of his book title: His desserts at Del Posto are the very antithesis of fancy.
Much of the time he specializes in exploring the old-school, birthday-party partnership between cake and ice cream.
His handiwork often involves a cake with grainy, nutty or savory elements (pecorino cheese, polenta, peas, carrots, almonds) that might nuzzle up on a plate next to a gelato or a sorbet with a bracingly herbal, nutty or vegetal base (basil, parsley, celery, olive oil, corn, cashews).
Theatrical gestures are kept to a minimum.
“I don’t necessarily want conversation to stop when it hits the table,” Mr.
Headley said, paraphrasing Claudia Fleming, the pioneering Gramercy Tavern pastry chef whom he cites as a major influence.
Headley played the drums in a series of wild, obscure punk bands.
(When he can, he still lets off steam at the skins.
) This is odd because on the surface Del Posto might look like the least punk place in New York.
It has sweeping staircases, candles everywhere, a wine list longer than “The Decameron” and a piano player serenading guests with “Over the Rainbow” and “Time in a Bottle.
” That said, the core aesthetic of punk rock shines through Mr.
Acts like the Ramones, Black Flag and Minor Threat believed in stripping a song down to its raw essence.
Allergic to fussiness and intensely fixated on the purity of fresh fruit and vegetables, Mr.
Headley aims to accomplish a similar feat with sweets.
He prefers to use the ripe products of nature and get out of their way.
Think of his roasted nectarine as an edible version of “I Wanna Be Sedated.
” “In the past, the dominant trend was the ornate, baroque style of dessert, and now it’s this hybrid gimmickry that seems to be dumbing down the world into an ‘Idiocracy'-like stupor,” Mr.
Headley said, referring to the 2006 movie.
“So by making desserts that are simple and of the season, and ignoring the powders, pastes, purées and compounds that mark the larder of many pastry chefs, simple food sort of becomes an act of defiance.
” In fact, that mantra represents the main reason Mr.
Ladner needed Del Posto to serve desserts that embody the rootsy soulfulness of Italian cooking.
He didn’t want the last course to be paraded to each table like a work of abstract art that, as he said, “doesn’t really taste or feel like food.
” He also needed a pastry chef who understood that it would be unproductive to take an oppositional stance toward the vision of Mario Batali, Joe Bastianich and Lidia Bastianich, Del Posto’s owners.
“We wanted someone who was willing to assimilate,” Mr.
More precisely, the pastry chef had to be open to learning at the elbow of Ms.
“Brooks was very warm to the idea of being influenced by her,” Mr.
“The two previous pastry chefs were not into that dialogue at all, which made it really hard.
Bastianich’s philosophy hinges on simplicity, she and Mr.
Headley “dance well together,” as she puts it.
“As a chef, you can exalt nature,” she said.
“When nature gives me the perfect apricot and I have not smothered it with something else, I feel the best.
Headley reminds readers countless times in “Fancy Desserts,” the punk-rock shtick is sort of a cover-up for his real identity.
Underneath it all, he views himself as an Italian grandmother, and he credits women with teaching him everything he knows.
“I am a femininity embracer,” he said.
Headley’s macho-avoidance that Kerry Diamond, one of the founders of the food-and-femmes-focused Cherry Bombe magazine, identified him as “the first guy we ever let write a piece for Cherry Bombe.
” She sees “Fancy Desserts” as a game-changer.
“Cookbooks have gotten so boring and formulaic,” Ms.
“Brooks’s cookbook is like no other cookbook.
” In spite of a full name — Brooks Oliver Headley — that seems like something plucked from an Edith Wharton novel, he was raised in the suburbs of Baltimore by a mother with roots in Calabria.
“Italian — that’s what I know,” he said.
He never went to culinary school.
When his musical pursuits hit a speed bump in 1999, he bumbled into a job at Galileo, a restaurant in Washington.
“It wasn’t like I wanted to be some fine-dining pastry chef, because I had no idea what that was,” he said.
“I had no idea what a tuile was.
I didn’t know how to spell tuile.
” (It’s a fragile decorative wafer.
) What hooked him, though, was the obsession of his boss and mentor, Laurie Alleman Weber.
“She was just so into it,” he said.
“I’m coming from a subculture of being obsessed with bands, and I instantly fell into this thing where Laurie was obsessed.
” Later, obsession hustled him to the West Coast, where, at Campanile in Los Angeles, he studied under another woman with a laserlike focus on detail: Nancy Silverton.
“Many of the recipes in this book are rip-offs masquerading as homage,” he writes in “Fancy Desserts.
” Even though “the only kitchen experience he had was making sandwiches,” Mrs.
Headley got the job at Galileo because of a letter he sent to the restaurant.
“It was so passionate and so touching,” she recalled.
“He talked about his grandmother.
” Once there, he sopped up Mrs.
Weber’s doctrine of dessert (“There were always the elements of hot and cold, and creamy and crunchy,” she said), and managed to thrive in a kitchen full of women.
“He would just ask the most sincere questions, where most guys would never show that they didn’t know something,” she said.
“They always had this macho thing.
He would open up all his vulnerability to you.
Headley has a knack for irony, but he’s dead serious about the name of his veggie-burger pop-up: Superiority Burger.
“I like to say I’m a fairly humble person, except with veggie burgers,” he said.
At a Taste Talks gathering of chefs and eaters in Brooklyn on Sunday, he and his crew served up about a thousand of them.
The burger, which was influenced by the Clean Slate sandwich in the “Saltie” cookbook, represents a capsule of the lessons he has absorbed from both fast food and haute cuisine.
In fact, all of his creations can be seen as clashes of delicious contradictions, and he’s fine with that.
“Perfect is definitely not my jam,” he said.
He’s the guy who winces at the prospect of putting a fig dessert on the printed menu because figs can be unreliable.
But he’s also the guy who wants his chocolate gelato to carry a slight memory-trace of American junk food.
“I toss in two types of cocoa powder to make it feel a little chalky — the way a Fudgsicle tastes a little chalky,” he writes in the book.
“Except this is the mean ‘Rosemary’s Baby’ Fudgsicle made by the weird neighbors.

An NYPD chopper made an emergency landing early Saturday, flying low over some homes in Queens before safely setting down in a soccer field, a witness said.
The helicopter landed on the Metropolitan Oval Soccer Field in Maspeth just before 3 a.
"I was taking out the trash when I heard it," said Mike Chambers, 49, who lives nearby.
"It cleared the houses by like 30 feet, and the fence by maybe 10.
"It came down fast, but smooth," Chambers added.
" It's unclear why the helicopter pilot felt the need to make an emergency landing.
The aircraft had no no mechanical problems, police said.
"They just figured it was safest to land," said a police source.
" Another NYPD helicopter carrying mechanics was brought in to check on the chopper before it was flown back to Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn.

A writer celebrates her aunt, a famous Italian socialite of great privilege, exquisite taste — and surprising good sense.
In the 60 years since her marriage to Gianni Agnelli, scion and chairman of the Fiat empire, my aunt Marella has created 15 homes located at varying altitudes on both sides of the Atlantic and north and south of the Mediterranean.
She has planted four gardens so large and articulate they are best described as parks, and designed her own line of fabrics.
She has worked with some of the great architects, decorators and landscape designers of her time.
And yet, when she first moved into the grand Agnelli house in Villar Perosa in the mountains southwest of Turin, the 26-year-old beauty felt at a loss.
She had recently returned from New York, where she had worked as an assistant to the photographer Erwin Blumenfeld.
“I spent the first months of my marriage on the sofa reading French novels and wondering what I could possibly do with all that time on my hands,” she told me in May.
Gianni, noticing his young wife’s hesitation to adopt the role of lady of the house, phoned up Countess Lily Volpi — a “dragoness,” according to Marella.
Volpi was the owner of Palazzo Volpi in Venice and known for her savoir faire as a hostess.
She gave the young bride a crash course in how to manage the kind of home Gianni expected: how to find the best chefs, where to get initials embroidered on bed linens or printed on notepads and matchboxes, how to seat guests at a formal dinner.
The Countess’s motto, Marella told me, laughing, was: “To catch a man all one needs is a bed, but it takes a well-run home to keep him.
” Marella would not find her vocation as a talented homemaker and gardener for another year.
When she did, it was in part thanks to the Paris decorator Stéphane Boudin (whom Jackie Kennedy had consulted on the décor of the White House) and the English gardener Russell Page, who guided her in the estate’s transformation.
“In retrospect,” she told me, “my central preoccupation was Gianni, and creating an environment for our art collection that he could relate to.
” Love is a concept to which Marella is finely attuned, and “amore” (with an exclamation mark) her preferred term of endearment for younger relatives.
When I was young and going through my first romantic troubles — and later, after meeting my future husband, the artist Sandro Chia — “zia Marella” was the person I turned to for advice.
After all, her own marriage to Gianni, though long and based on a mutual devotion, did have its share of heartache.
“So,” she’d ask with her ironic smile, “can you imagine your life without this person.
” Love, according to her, came in two guises: “amitié amoureuse” and “amour passionné.
” The first she described as an easy, loving friendship based on elective affinities.
“L’amour passionné,” on the other hand, took over one’s life.
An uncompromising participant in the second category, she broke off her engagement in her early 20s to Charles de Ganay, a French aristocrat endowed with a castle, after he asked to postpone the date of their marriage by one week in order to go grouse hunting.
“In my view, marriage was never an obligation,” Marella recalls.
In Gianni — restless, adventurous, charismatic and six years her elder — Marella found what she had been looking for.
“Many women have chosen motherhood over marriage,” she once told me with a note of regret in her voice.
” I became aware of the effect of Gianni’s presence on Marella when I was 8 or 9 and spending the last weeks of summer, as I always did, with my parents at Villar Perosa.
The days would pass by with hiking in nearby mountains, exploring ancient villages and buying cheese from farmers along the way.
Back home, we would spend the afternoons chatting over games of Scrabble or chess.
Marella, at those times, was her relaxed, playful self.
The change would occur around seven in the evening, just before the helicopter announcing Gianni’s return from the Fiat headquarters in Turin would burst into the domestic calm of the day.
By the time he strode up the lawn, his valet Brunetto always by his side, Marella was in full splendor.
With the disorderly piles of books and newspapers swept away, drinks were waiting in the candle-lit loggia.
Everyone, from the help to the guests, was in full attire.
Whereas Marella never did care for refined meals, preferring fresh vegetables or pasta al pomodoro, Gianni spent time every morning at the crack of dawn with the chef Giulio, discussing the evening’s menu: the catch of the day from the nearest sea, wild game cooked with wine and herbs, polenta with porcini mushrooms.
Once, in their Saint Moritz chalet, I had the not-much-appreciated privilege of tasting a piece of bull’s testicles, flown in from Pamplona, a matador’s gift to the “avvocato,” as Gianni was called in tribute to his law degree.
After my marriage to Sandro 20 years ago, the Brunello di Montalcino he makes became the wine to be served chez the Agnellis in the evening.
Gianni had chosen it for its label, a painting of a naked satyr, as much as for its taste.
Gianni was allergic to boredom.
His closest friends were all passionate sailors and, like him, full of stories.
Marella’s friends were more intellectual.
There was the artist Niki de Saint Phalle, the designer Federico Forquet, the historian Benedetta Craveri and, of course, her two Caracciolo brothers: my father, Nicola, an environmentalist and journalist, and Carlo, who founded the left-wing national daily, La Repubblica.
Gianni and Marella met many of their closest friends — the de la Rentas, the Paleys, the Kissingers — in the United States.
Both of them had American mothers and felt, I think, free in that country, where they were not perceived as surrogate royalty.
Marella, endowed with a good memory, a sharp sense of humor and a skill for anecdotes, kept the conversation fast-paced, intense and well informed.
Although as a child I would not sit at their dinner table — children in the Agnelli household at that time were to be seen but not heard — I knew that the art of conversation was expected.
One day, as an adolescent, I naïvely thought I could entertain a small group of guests with the description of a bizarre dream I had the night before.
Marella quipped that it was time I learned the “three-S rule”: “sogni,” “salute” and “soldi” (dreams, health and money).
These were the subjects, she explained, one should never discuss in public.
In private, of course, Marella and I did discuss health and dreams.
She has always been an advocate of exercise in the open air — skiing, walking and swimming — and we were both interested in Jungian psychoanalysis and Buddhist philosophy.
As for money, that never was an issue — or at least not until the day she changed my life.
My childhood was spent in my parents’ three-bedroom flat in Rome.
It was a simple ménage without uniformed butlers, chefs or grand soirees.
Unlike my cousins, her children Edoardo and Margherita, who went to private schools abroad, I had gone to a state school in Rome, where I did extremely poorly.
The summer I was 16, having to retake most of my exams, I was sent off to my aunt’s remote villa in Corsica to study.
Instead, I decided to imitate my painter cousin Margherita, who by then was in her early 20s and a mother of three, and took up watercolors.
“Marellina,” she said, for that’s what I was always called in the family, “you have to get a grip on yourself.
” In her characteristic no-nonsense style, she told me to get on with it because I, unlike her children, could not fall back on a conspicuous fortune.
The realization, I hate to admit, came as a shock.
By September I had persuaded my parents to send me to school in London.
I worked as a salesclerk in a men’s shirt shop before starting my first job as a stringer while studying at Oxford University.
Perhaps her niece living in la-la land triggered my aunt’s own memories of being a young girl.
Marella and her siblings had spent their childhood in a 16th-century villa on the hill of Florence that their mother, an heiress of a whiskey distillery, Clarke Bros.
, had bought shortly before her own marriage to Filippo, my Italian grandfather.
The whiskey inheritance ensured the family a carefree existence until the depression of the 1930s, when Filippo, a novelist and poet from an aristocratic Neapolitan family, enrolled in the diplomatic service, becoming the first member of his family to actually work for a living.
When he was posted to Turkey, they moved there.
This turn of fortune, greatly amplified by the war years that followed, laid the foundations of Marella’s own self-reliance.
Once the war ended, she went to study art and set design at the Académie Julian in Paris before moving to New York.
Years later, I still remember the glee with which she announced she had cashed her first check from her line of fabric.
Sometimes I cannot help but think that the only thing Marella and I have in common is our names.
How different her world is from mine, and how ineffably beautiful hers now appears.
Her times were characterized by a formality that infused an aura of myth into each personality that emerged.
Now I see that much beauty was borne out of Gianni and Marella’s exceptional life together.
This life did not spare Marella unspeakable losses.
Edoardo leaped to his death in 2000 aged 46, and, after Gianni’s demise in 2003, she became embroiled in a legal conflict with Margherita, her only daughter.
But even the deepest sorrow does not last forever.
In June this year, a new Marella was born.
The daughter of Ginevra Elkann Gaetani was named after her great-grandmother.
Big Marella, who is now 87, goes to visit her namesake whenever she can.
She finds it thrilling, she tells me, to hold this bundle of fresh energy, a new chapter in a complex but vibrant history, in her arms.

Train Rider is out of town on a business trip, so I do not have any commuter rail updates.
As both WHDH-TV Channel 7 and The Daily News reported this morning, the new parking fees are a reality at MBTA station lots.
Did you see yesterday's Boston Sunday Globe front page article.
It was all about how the Big Dig enhancement's have only pushed traffic bottlenecks farther outside of downtown Boston.
As many of us unscientifically expected, the $15 billion spent on the Big Dig didn't eliminate traffic jams.
Sure, while there may not be a lot of traffic jams in the downtown core, getting to and from Boston is just as difficult as ever.
The Big Dig is at the core of the funding problems plaguing mass transit in Massachusetts.
In an editorial from today's Telegram & Gazette the different views of eliminating the Pike are presented.
The Pike was also the focus of yesterday's "Starts & Stops" in the Globe.
I encourage anyone who commutes on the commuter rail to read yesterday's "Starts & Stops.
" It really details the issues at hand that commuters face and it contains some fantastic comments.
In other news, according to this article from Saturday's Boston Globe, the Federal Transit Authority shot down the T's request to purchase commuter rail locomotives from a European company.
Finally, some Boston residents are trying to get the No.

Just a short time ago, I received a press release to talk about how the MTA Bus Company received an award from the Federal Transit Administration.
Here are the complete details: Earlier this spring, the Federal Transit Administration singled out the MTA Bus Company for its dramatically increased ridership from 2006 to 2007.
Since that time, the MTA Bus Company has seen additional ridership gains.
Deputy FTA Regional Administrator Anthony Carr was on hand to present MTA Bus Company President Joe Smith with an award at this week’s MTA Board meeting.
The MTA Bus Company was created in September 2004, consolidating the operations of seven bus companies that operated under independent franchises granted by the New York City Department of Transportation.
The merging of the private companies into the MTA Bus Company began in January 2005 and was completed in February 2006, creating the tenth-largest bus company in the country.
Dale Hemmerdinger said: “While the award highlights gains during its first two years of service, it’s important to note that MTA Bus provided 20 million more rides in 2008 than its predecessors provided in 2004.
It goes to show that improved service and new equipment can go a long way toward increasing customer demand.
” MTA Interim Executive Director and CEO Helena E.
Williams said: “Ridership gains of nearly 20 percent in less than four years are a true testament to the successful and seamless integration of seven bus companies into an efficient and much-improved operation.
Smith, Senior Vice President of the New York City Transit Department of Buses and President of the MTA Bus Company and Long Island Bus said: “I’m delighted to receive this award on behalf of all of the hard-working employees of the MTA Bus Company, who strive to provide safe and efficient service to our customers every day.
Their dedication and commitment to improving service were instrumental to the ridership gains we achieved.
” MTA Bus committed to aggressively upgrading the overall service delivery of its bus operations by purchasing new buses to replace an aging fleet and adjusting schedules and routes to better match travel demand.
MTA Bus now operates 45 local bus routes in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, and 35 express bus routes between Manhattan and the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens.
It has a fleet of 1,323 buses serving approximately 400,000 riders daily.
Last year, the Nigerian government embarked on an anti-slum campaign, determined to destroy the blighted shanty towns in Makoko, a fishing village in the country's capital.
Here, most residents live on stilted structures atop the lagoon itself, so it's rather easy for the government to rid the city of the slum conditions on its façade: it just chops the supports down and the homes fall apart.
This is obviously a pretty horrible solution.
Architect Kunlé Adeyemi proposes something else: a brigade of solar-powered floating buildings pretty enough to quell the government's purge.
Adeyemi, who was born in Nigeria and is now based out of the Netherlands, began with a three-story school built to withstand earthquakes, floods, and climate change.
"Makoko is a settlement that people often drive by.
I've driven by it myself for many years," he told Co.
"But I started to visit and I was inspired, shocked, and motivated by the environment.
I asked if there was anything I could do, and they said the school was always flooding, and they needed an extension.
" Makoko Floating School, large enough to accommodate 100 students ages 4 to 12, is made from local timber and 256 plastic drums, and is outfitted with solar panels, rainwater harvesting facilities, and a toilet.
At the prism's pinnacle is an open-air classroom, the middle floor is made of enclosed rooms, and the bottom platform has a water slide and play space.
Exist that he hoped his prototype will "be a catalyst and that a lot of other people will adopt similar systems to address climate change and flooding.

The NYPD is taking aim at Rockaways beachgoers — cracking down on minor infractions such as drinking beer, walking dogs and climbing on rock jetties, The Post has learned.
During the Memorial Day weekend, cops issued 152 “quality-of-life violation” summonses — three times more than the same period last year.
They’re targeting families who are just trying to enjoy themselves at the beach — people who might drink one or two beers in a red cup,” said the manager of a popular Rockaways restaurant, who asked that her name and establishment not be revealed.
“We’ve had cops drive past us on the beach and ask to see what’s in our coolers.
” She added that cops recently ticketed her husband for walking his dog on the beach, against the rules.
“There are a lot of areas around here, where there is real crime.
They should put more time into that.
” On the beach, cops have fanned out — some in plain clothes, others on four-wheelers — to catch rule breakers.
They’re slapping swimmers and sunbathers with tickets that include open-container laws, failing to obey park signs, public urination and littering.
In one recent case, a Post reporter saw a man snapping photos on a jetty near Beach 90th Street ticketed for walking on the rocks.
He supposedly failed to obey a park sign — even though vandals changed the sign to read, “Keep…Jetty…Diving.
” Fifteen minutes later, a pair of lovebirds were ticketed for the same offense.
Some people drinking beer nearby were also ticketed during the same 20-minute period on Sunday.
Most of the summonses yield fines in the $50 range — but beachgoers said they would prefer a warning first.
“It’s not fair … I will talk to someone about it,” said the jetty-climbing man.
A police source claimed the spike in tickets was in part due to a much warmer holiday weekend this year than 2013, when there were 50 tickets issued.
89 of 95 people found the following review helpful Are you willing to start thinking like a freak.
A great book for approaching life in a creative way.
, Think Like a Freak: The Authors of Freakonomics Offer to Retrain Your Brain (Hardcover) Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed reading this book.
The way that the writers can intertwine different stories to make valid points is remarkable.
It really does a good job of proving by observation how some things in life seem irrational, but ultimately make a lot of sense.
The only problems that I have with the book are the length, just over 200 pages, and it rehashes a lot of stuff that they go over in other works.
This book is easy enough that you can probably read in one or two sittings and it is very captivating throughout.
I really enjoyed the anecdotes they use to bring across the point of the book that everyone can benefit by thinking differently about the world (i.
One of the main things that I liked is how they describe the way children ask questions and are so curious about everything.
Children don't have a set worldview and are eager to learn by asking a lot of questions.
Parents often dismiss these questions when it might be valuable to see the world through a child's eyes and challenge set it stone opinions or thoughts.
The writers also make a good point about how the three hardest words in the English language are "I don't know" and how it should be okay to say these words.
By applying these words to our lives, we will first of all lie a lot less and more importantly be able to demonstrate a willingness to find out answers to questions we simply don't know.
As I stated before, I wish that this book was longer, but I really did enjoy all that was written and would recommend "Think like a Freak" for those interested in challenging their current worldview and seeking to approach life in a creative way.

I have the HDX, so I'm not sure if what I'm about to say WHOLY applies, but on that Kindle Fire, you can allow apps from other sources in the settings, so I just downloaded the 1Mobile Market store and have been able to use several apps not in the Amazon store, including SnapChat and Instagram.

The starting point and most important element of CalPERS successful return on investment is our asset allocation - our diversification among stocks, bonds, cash and other investments.
Asset allocation is not an asset-only or liability-only decision.
All factors, including liabilities, benefit payments, operating expenses, and employer and member contributions are taken into account in determining the appropriate asset allocation mix.
Our goal is to maximize returns at a prudent level of risk - an ever-changing balancing act between market volatility and long-term goals.
CalPERS follows a strategic asset allocation policy that identifies the percentage of funds to be invested in each asset class.
Policy targets are typically implemented over a period of several years on market declines and through dollar cost averaging.
Listed below is CalPERS current asset allocation mix by market value and policy target percentages as of June 30, 2014.

From CBS 2: Residents living in a landmarked building in Greenwich Village are unsure of when they’ll be able to return to their homes, and it appears the property owner could have prevented the issue from occurring in the first place.
On Wednesday, an evacuation order was issued for 20 apartments and two commercial spaces at 85 Christopher St.
The Department of Buildings had been called in to investigate after it appeared the facade of the building, which was built around 1900, was buckling.
Following an initial investigation, officials said on Thursday that the supports between the roof level and sixth floor failed, causing the wall of the building to buckle outward.
Department of Buildings officials added that cracking was observed throughout the exterior of the building.
The incident should not have come as a surprise to the property owner, who was issued an Environmental Control Board violation in March, 2013 regarding the failure to maintain the building’s facade.
The property owner owes a $1,000 fine on the violation, the buildings department said.
In January the Department of Buildings issued a DOB violation with a $1,500 civil penalty to the property owner for failure to correct the previous violation relating to the building’s facade.
The penalty has yet to be paid, officials said.

We all love living vicariously through the lives of the rich and famous, don't we.
The huge houses, the bling, the far-flung vacations, the champagne flowing from pure gold kitchen faucets.
But that's not the reality for most wealthy families.
For every loaded celebrity who spends money extravagantly until it's all gone, there are dozens of rich people quietly building their personal fortunes.
You'd never know how much money they have because they live so simply.
True, most wealthy people are born into affluence and are taught how to keep their assets growing.
But what about the ordinary folks who build their prosperity themselves.
Lucky for you, we got to the bottom of it and boiled it down to 8 money secrets of wealthy families we should all steal -- starting now.

I'm not sure where to start with this mess.
It sounds as if the server gave herself a *lot* of leeway after you stated you weren't in a rush.
Issue 1: Did 50 minutes really elapse before she came to take your dinner order.
(Time passes faster for a server than it does for diners.
I know this from having been a waiter in another life.
) Issue 2: While you had no idea how long it would take for the server to deliver whatever to another party, you could have requested that she finish taking your order.
She (or you) could have enlisted another waiter to do so after 5 minutes of the server being away.
3: Managers should try to refrain from chastising staff while they're in the middle of a shift.
It just causes bad energy all the way around.
I have to wonder why the boss didn't cut to the chase and jot down your order himself.
Issue 4: As ticked off as she obviously was, the server did herself no favors by bringing up the fact she had been reprimanded.
And continuing with the digs for the rest of the meal is just immature.
Issue 5: Did you try to seek out the owner.
Or had you endured enough for one night.
Regardless, shame on him for the lack of follow-up.
Do you have a history with this restaurant that suggests your night was a fluke.
If so, I'd consider going back.
If not --- there are lots of other places that would be happy to feed you and treat you well.
I'd like to open by reaching out to a couple of posters from last week.
If the person who went to the new DGBG on H St.
NW (and wondered what the fuss is about) is reading this, please reach out to me with an email contact.
Also, Patrick O'Connell from the Inn at Little Washington sent me the following yesterday: We are attempting to reach out to the poster who’s experience at The Inn was marred by neighboring guests a few weeks ago even though the food was, in their words, “great as always”.
While it can be a juggling act balancing overly festive and casually dressed patrons with the expectations of more formal guests, we embrace the responsibility of ensuring that everyone leaves our place happy.
Therefore, we would very much like to speak to the posters in question in order to find a satisfactory resolution.
Please suggest that they contact our Director of Dining Services Neil O’Heir at 540-675-5242 or noheir@theinnatlittlewashington.
Thank you for providing this valuable forum for communication.
With appreciation and warmest regards, On with the show, folks.
City Councilman Peter Koo (D-Flushing) has requested that the Department of City Planning take a look at overdevelopment in his district.
The councilman has asked the agency to conduct a study to determine areas that have “out-of-context” developments and to then make zoning amendments based on the study’s findings.
“My constituents deserve the best possible protections against overdevelopment in their neighborhoods, and I want to make sure no block is left behind,” Koo said.
The councilman’s appeal came after a group of Queensboro Hill neighbors became irate about a new two-story house on their block, at 146-15 56th Road, which they said dwarfed the small, single-story homes around it.
Don Capalbi, president of the Queensboro Hill Civic Association, forwarded the residents’ complaints to Koo’s office in February.
The new 2,290-square-foot house, which has been built legally under current zoning regulations, will replace an 899-square-foot home that was built in 1935 in a line of rowhouses, according to city Department of Buildings records.
“With Councilman Koo’s strong support, we anticipate City Planning will consider in a fair manner the zoning revisions necessary to deter extreme cases of neighborhood-destructive construction while we continue to support expansion of affordable housing,” Capalbi said.
A spokesman for City Planning said the agency has received Koo’s letter and is reviewing it.
Since the early 2000s, a coalition of civic leaders called the Queens Civic Congress has successfully worked to rezone a number of neighborhoods in northeast Queens to prevent out-of-scale houses from being built.
A rezoning of Bayside was finalized in 2005, along with downzonings of Whitestone and College Point that same year.
A rezoning of Waldheim was adopted in 2008 and North Flushing was rezoned in 2010.
“We have fought long and hard to downzone many residential neighborhoods to prevent over-devleopment,” said Richard Hellenbrecht, the president of the Queens Civic Congress.
“The residential areas of Queens are mostly inhabited by middle-class taxpayers who are critical for the future of the city.
” The group has also been pushing the city over the years to create a separate zoning district for single-family attached houses, such as the townhouses on 56th Road, as they currently fit into designations for multi-family units.
Urban planner Paul Graziano, who has worked on rezonings in much of northeast Queens, said that because the new house on 56th road is only 19 feet high and the row of houses is attached, the only thing that could be done to prevent houses of a similar size being built on that block would be to rezone it from its current R4 designation, to R3-2.
“If they were to rezone that half block to an R3-2, then properties would not be able to expand because it would not give them additional floor area,” he said.
R3-2 is the lowest density designation that allows multi-unit dwellings.
Graziano said the Queens Civic Congress previously pushed for a zoning change in other parts of Queensboro Hill that would prevent over-sized development, but City Planning failed to finalize its request.

One of the highlights of a daily walk from the DeKalb Avenue station at Flatbush Avenue Extension and Willoughby Street up to Court Street is the lobby of a Metrotech Building that features the late video artist Nam June Paik's videowall.
Paik (July 20, 1932 – January 29, 2006) was a Korean American artist who worked with a variety of media and is considered to be the first video artist.
He is credited with an early usage (1974) of the term "electronic super highway" in application to telecommunications.
He was an early member of the Fluxus art movement and among many other works, projects and experiments was known for his collaboration with cellist Charlotte Moorman, known for topless performances, and Paik's construciotn of a TV monitor bra for the avant garde artist.
Paik: "Our life is half natural and half technological.
You cannot deny that high-tech is progress.
Yet if you make only high-tech, you make war.
So we must have a strong human element to keep modesty and natural life.
" "Skin has become inadequate in interfacing with reality.
Technology has become the body's new membrane of existence.
" "The only way to win a race is to run alone.
" "There is no rewind button for life.
" "When too perfect, lieber Gott böse.
Irish musician Ciaran Dwyer writes to the blog, "Recently i wrote a ballad that we will be including as a b-side on a 7" single that will be released in April (The song Back Disco from our record will be the A-side), Its an acoustic tune called "Chelsea Bards" and i have included a verse in the tune about the Chelsea and Stanley.
We spent the guts of that day in front of the window drinking beer in the Whitehorse tavern.
Then after a short visit to Village wines, we made our way back to Room 325 and laid this down in one take.
" You can listen here: http://www.

And then In Doc Hollidays, we put Hank Williams on the jukebox and drank the rest of the night away.

Sadly, we have learned that Stormé Delarverié, a long-time Chelsea Hotel resident and icon of the LGBT community passed away yesterday.
Stormé had been living at the CABS Nursing Home in Brooklyn since October 2010.
UPDATE - The funeral service for Storme will be held Thursday, May 29 at the Greenwich Village Funeral Home from 7 - 9 pm.
Despite health issues in recent years, Stormé continued to remain active in the gay and lesbian community.
She could be seen proudly waving from the Stonewall Veteran Association’s Cadillac during the Gay Pride Parade held each June in Manhattan.
In 2006, Stormé participated as a speaker in "Kings and Queens of New York City: A Drag Summit".
On June 7, 2012, Brooklyn Pride, Inc.
honored Stormé at the Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture, citing her ground breaking work as a drag performer in the Jewel Box Revue an early racially integrated traveling gay drag show.
And just last month she was honored, along with Edie Windsor, by the Brooklyn Pride Community.
Born on Christmas Eve, 1920, in New Orleans, Stormé worked professionally as a drag king and torch singer.
Pictures of her in drag show her to be suave and handsome; uncompromisingly androgynous.
In the forties through the sixties she was the emcee—or, better yet, the ringmaster--for the Jewel Box Revue, a traveling gay drag show, the first in America to be integrated.
Playing to mixed race, as well as mixed gay and straight, audiences, the revue gained mainstream acceptance in larger cities around the country.
In this context, Stormé was the subject of the 1987 film, Stormé: The Lady of the Jewel Box.
Produced by DC filmmaker Michelle Parkerson, the movie emphasized Stormé’s appropriation of male symbols of power, such as suits and ties, in furtherance of the gay rights struggle.
[And, as Stormé once told me, “I’ve got a story, I chopped off my hair, put on men’s clothes, and joined the Jewel Box Review.
” ] But Stormé’s real claim to fame is that she’s the person who threw the first punch at Stonewall, the rebellion (named for the bar) on Christopher Street that gave birth to the gay rights movement.
Prior to Stonewall, gay people were subject to arrest, pretty much arbitrarily, for such offenses as kissing or holding hands in public, or for dressing in the clothes of the opposite sex.
The police staged raids on gay bars at unpredictable times, arresting whoever they pleased.
The night of June 27, 1969, was seemingly like any other, with one exception: earlier that evening the city had mourned the passing of gay icon Judy Garland in a funeral attended by twenty-two thousand people.
Whether this had anything to do with what happened next is open to speculation, but this time, when the police raided the Stonewall Bar in the early hours of June 28th, they soon found that the gay people had had enough and were ready to fight back—in particular one formidable drag king.
I doubt that Stormé went there that night looking for trouble, but she wasn’t going to run from it either.
When a plain-clothed policeman punched her outside the bar, she retaliated, slugging him in the jaw.
When asked what the policeman did next, Stormé, in an interview for the gay TV news magazine, In The Life, replied, with characteristic terseness, “He was on the ground.
” -- (Excerpt From Legends of the Chelsea Hotel.
) In later years Stormé worked as a bouncer at the Henrietta Hudson bar.
She also acted as an informal security guard at the Chelsea Hotel making sure the lobby was cleared of riff raff late at night.
And, she enjoyed spending evenings with good friends at the nearby restaurant East of Eighth.
When the hotel was taken over by developers in 2007, Stormé, though nearly 90 years of age, still understood exactly what was happening and never wavered from her opposition to the people who were trying to evict us from our beloved Chelsea Hotel.
Stormé was a real original, a true Chelsea Hotel artist who was always willing to lend a helping hand to others.
She was one of the sweetest people you’d ever meet, although you didn’t want to get on her bad side.
There won’t be another like Stormé.

Following the latest heightened, bellicose threats from North Korea, the UN Security Council unanimously passed a new round of sanctions on the already isolated country, aimed primarily at starving their growing missile program.
However, increased sanctions are unlikely to create a positive change in North Korean conduct.

WASHINGTON — At the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual spring meetings, concerns about crisis have given way to concerns about complacency.
The euro zone has re-emerged from recession.
Emerging-market jitters have quieted.
The fiscal battles in the United States have abated.
But the recovery remains fragile and in many cases, growth remains sluggish, leaving a jobs gap of 62 million.
“The overriding topic for discussion will be the topic of growth, quest for higher growth, better quality growth, more inclusive growth and sustainable growth,” said Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the fund, speaking with reporters on the eve of the weekend conference.
” Underlying the discussions of inflation, interest rates, fiscal balance and trade policy among the assembled ministers were concerns about Ukraine, as news of pro-Russian activists seizing official buildings in the eastern part of the former Soviet republic sent jitters through the meetings.
Officials said they hoped that the situation would not escalate.
But if it did, it might pose serious consequences to Europe’s fragile recovery.
“We are monitoring the economic situation in Ukraine, mindful of any risks to economic and financial stability, and welcome the I.
’s recent engagement with Ukraine,” said a communiqué from the Group of 20, which consists of the world’s biggest economies.
The fund is preparing a financial rescue package for Kiev that would come with stringent conditions, including tax increases and cuts in government spending.
The package would be worth $14 billion to $18 billion, Ms.
The World Bank, the fund’s sister organization, is also offering Ukraine billions in aid, with individual countries preparing bilateral packages, as well.
Finance ministers and central bankers also discussed the possibility of new penalties for Russia, said Jacob J.
“There is broad and strong unity within the G-7 on increasing the sanctions and costs in response to escalating action from Russia,” he said, referring to the Group of 7, meaning Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.
“There was no dissent in the room that it was essential that there be unity in taking action if necessary.
Lew plans to sign a declaration “moving forward” $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine.
At the meetings, the United States also took heated criticism for Congress’s failure to agree to a 2010 reform package that would give emerging-market countries more say within the fund.
The Obama administration has repeatedly urged leaders on Capitol Hill to ratify the package, which requires no new money from the United States, to no avail.
“The end of the year for me is the final limit,” said Guido Mantega, Brazil’s finance minister, according to Reuters.
“Four years waiting for me is just too much.
” The Group of 20 gave a year-end deadline for Congress to act — saying that at that point, the monetary fund might move on without the United States’ assent.
“If the 2010 reforms are not ratified by year-end, we will call on the I.
to build on its existing work and develop options for next steps,” a communiqué said.
Much of the rest of the talks focused on creating jobs and strengthening growth now that the world has made its way out of crisis.
“Short-term risks to the global economy have eased,” said Dr.
Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank.
“Increasingly, our worries are focused on the medium term.
Our concern is that the pace of reform could be slowing in this postcrisis period.
The focus must return urgently to the structural reform agenda.
Even a small setback can result in leaving millions of families in destitution rather than escaping poverty.
” With that, the conversation among the world’s finance ministers and central bankers generally atomized into individual prescriptions for individual countries.
Growth has picked up in many rich countries, especially in the United States, and Europe has started growing again, too.
But the Continent seems to have settled into a period of low inflation and low growth, with widespread concern that the will to make the major economic changes necessary for a stronger recovery might have faded along with the crisis.
“We remain concerned by inflation rates consistently below target and weak demand,” Mr.
“More needs to be done to support growth and guard against further disinflation in the euro area.
” The effect of Japan’s major stimulus package — called “Abenomics,” after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe — might also be waning.
cut its estimates of the country’s growth shortly before the meetings.
It has urged Tokyo to make structural reforms to bolster its labor market, by, for instance, bringing women into the work force.
At a meeting in Sydney at the end of February, members of the Group of 20 major economies — which include rich countries like Canada and developing economies like Brazil and China — agreed to commit to policies to increase growth.
The specific target is to lift economic output 2 percent beyond its current trajectory over the coming five years.
Without policies to enhance growth and create jobs, inequality might intensify and tens of millions of workers might remain jobless.
“A massive global jobs gap which opened at the height of the financial crisis continues to widen and will do so in the years ahead unless growth both accelerates and is also job-rich,” said Guy Ryder, the director general of the International Labor Organization.
“Creating jobs and narrowing inequalities are essential.

Paik met Charlotte Moorman in New York in 1964, where she was organizing the performance of Karlheinz Stockhausen's 'Originale' (‘Originals’), a piece in which Paik had been cast in Cologne in 1961.
From that time on, they appeared together in numerous performances for which Paik developed his first video objects.
'TV-Bra for Living Sculpture' – the photo was taken in 1970 during a performance in the 'Happening & Fluxus' exhibition in Cologne – is composed of two miniature cathode ray tubes which Charlotte Moorman wears instead of a bra.
Paik's intention is "to humanize electronics and technology.
By using TV as bra, the most intimate belonging of human being, we will demonstrate the human use of technology, and so stimulate the viewers NOT for something mean but stimulate their phantasy to look for the new imaginative and humanistic ways of using technology.
From the NY Times: The new complex, estimated to cost $750 million for the first phase, will sit on a city-owned, 30-acre lot in College Point, near Ulmer Street and 28th Avenue.
Classrooms, offices and a gym, constructed to simulate the kinds of conditions officers face on the street, will be built first.
Later, when the economy improves, a firing range, driver training area and a “tactical training village” will be built as police facilities scattered around the city will be consolidated at the Queens location.
Officials said the building would have a 3,000-car parking garage.
The mayor, in a statement, said the location in northeast Queens “is also well-served by existing mass transportation options.
” But the nearest subway stop, the Main Street, Flushing, terminus of the No.
7 line, is more than a mile from the new academy, and is itself a block from a Long Island Rail Road stop.
Both train stops are adjacent to city bus routes that serve the academy site.
In response to questions about the location, Edward Skyler, the deputy mayor for operations, said the city was sensitive to that point and noted that the Fire Department’s academy, on Randalls Island, is not served by the subway.

com Tons of beautiful images, I was really surprised I'm not one to rush to review apps (I know I should do it more), but this one deserves it.
I've checked out several wallpaper apps over the years and most were either total disappointments or at best somewhat helpful.
One of the apps I looked at this week had about ten pictures, it was such a waste.
So I was really surprised to find this one.
It has dozens of really stunning high quality images just in the nature and floral categories alone.
Really nice pics that look terrific on my iPad.
My only complaint is that there's no search or tags.
It doesn't have annoying pop-up ads, they're just on a banner at the bottom.
I downloaded this app a couple of times before & was disappointed when I would download a photo & it would not be in my photo album.
I finally figured it out today, if you go into settings & then to privacy there should be a photos section & if you click on that you will see that the setting for that app will be off.
Once you turn it on, it allows the app to access your photo album.
I'll admit I haven't used the app a ton yet as I've just downloaded it a few minutes ago and so haven't noticed any glaring problems.
The pictures are big and beautiful.
There's a nice mix of nature, urban, and abstract.
I haven't run across themed backgrounds yet but I like the idea.
I also like the option to download fitted or full sized images.
I only wish there was a favorites function so I could go through and fav all the ones I like most so they're not crowding up my phone and so I can look through them faster.
(I download them in full size so it takes a bit per pic and there are so many nice ones.
) A comments section would be nice, too.
EDIT: I see what people are talking about now with only seeing a zoomed in square on the full size version of the pics vs the complete image on the quadrant view.
From the NY Times: In District 24, the heavily crowded area around Corona, Queens, the city’s capital plan last year budgeted new space for 4,300 students; that number has been cut to 2,200.
Among the projects that would be delayed are a new gymnasium and classrooms for 120 students at Public School 87 in Middle Village, Queens.
87, students have gym classes in a basement lunchroom, and there are only two bathrooms each for the 600 boys and girls in the school, causing long lines, said Councilwoman Elizabeth Crowley, who represents the district.
“The community has waited more than 10 years for this, and it’s pennies in the scope of things,” Ms.
But she said she was hopeful that the State Legislature would restore some of the financing in the budget negotiations in the coming weeks.

All'interno dei rapporti che Eni coltiva con l'Africa e proprio in omaggio a una tradizione di sostegno alle battaglie per l'emancipazione dei popoli e per il rispetto della dignità della persona, si dovrebbero garantire a quell'area del mondo adeguati livelli di protezione dei diritti fondamentali dell'uomo.

Piccole cose, piccole conquiste, piccoli contributi che producono grandi sorrisi e grandi abbracci, che scaldano il cuore, che sciolgono in un lampo amarezze e frustrazioni.
Per quei bimbi il "niente" e il "qualcosa" hanno una precisa dimensione.

CHICAGO — On the first day of “boot camp,” Dr.
Wayne asked the Northwestern Memorial Hospital class of new interns for a show of hands if any were nervous.
“Those of you who did not raise your hand,” Dr.
Wayne told them, “are not being honest.
” It is not just the new interns, thrust into settings of real-life health care, who naturally feel some anxiety this time of year.
Patients, too, might be a bit skittish.
The so-called July Effect, though disputed by some, holds that medical errors spike when beginners arrive at hospitals.
The boot camp, conducted under the watch of Dr.
Wayne, the vice chairwoman of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, provides the interns with a three-day session in June to prepare them for bedside assignments.
Wayne and others, it seems prudent for interns to practice on artificial patients before going to work on those who actually bleed.
A study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2011 reported that “mortality increases and efficiency decreases” when a new crew of interns comes aboard.
The 81 interns at Northwestern are graduates of some of the nation’s most prestigious medical schools.
But they find themselves in an unfamiliar setting.
During the first hour of the boot camp, one intern was reported lost in the building.
Northwestern officials say the program is the most rigorous of its kind in the nation, with a requirement that interns pass graded tests in procedures and communication skills before being allowed to move ahead.
In one life-or-death situation, a robotic patient lay motionless on a bed, tubes sticking into the throat, in an intensive care unit filled with flashing lights and ominous beeping.
Michael Donnan, 26, who hours earlier donned a badge that read, “M.
,” was in charge of the crisis.
“This is tricky,” he muttered, sounding apprehensive, as he stared at the respiratory screen, weighing his options.
Seeming a bit tentative, he punched in a series of numbers.
His colleagues studied his moves, some of them taking notes.
In a few moments, the beeping ceased.
The interns waited for a verdict.
Matthew Nitzberg, the chief medical resident, who had been watching and assessing from behind the glass.
” he said, eliciting a peal of giggles from the interns.
What he meant, he explained, was that it was a virtuoso performance.
As complicated as the medical procedures can be, Dr.
Wayne said, students typically have a harder time with communication skills at the bedside.
In a boot camp session titled “Difficult Conversations,” residents talk to a dying patient, played by a Chicago actor, Ed Dzialo.
Suneel Kamath, a graduate of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, stepped to the bedside of Mr.
Dzialo, who said he was “looking forward to the summer” and “going back to work.
” The intern needed to explain that a bowel obstruction had made it impossible to do any further chemotherapy or surgery for the man’s colon cancer.
The patient likely had only weeks to live.
“I hate to be the bearer of bad news,” the intern said.
Dzialo, his eyes fixed with fear, listened to the grim prognosis, then turned his head to the side.
“I’m dying,” said the actor, lamenting that he was in his 40s and had “wasted my life.
Kamath tried to reassure the patient otherwise, telling him that he had “worked hard every day” and done his best.
As the patient looked away in dejection, the intern said he wanted to raise end-of-life issues, like who would be designated to make a decision to remove him from life support.
The intern conceded that these were “not fun topics.
” After the session, the actor asked Dr.
Kamath to assess his bedside manner.
The intern gave himself good marks, saying he believed he had appropriately “stayed on task.
Dzialo, who has been trained by palliative experts about such discussions, was a bit more critical.
He noted the “not fun” phrase, rather an understatement in the context.
He also suggested that the young doctor focus on “exploring my feelings,” instead of “telling me” how he had lived his life.
Kamath acknowledged that having a discussion with a dying patient, albeit an actor playing a role, was quite different from learning from a textbook.
As the boot camp officials see it, this was a lesson that will prove useful in the future, when a scared, dying patient is not pretending.

Award-winning, bestselling writer Sarah Waters visits L.
The event will include an interview, reading and Q&A.
Actor David Schwimmer may have a tough time making friends when he moves into his new East Village town house.
Instead of rolling out the welcome mat, neighbors have taken to leaving the “Friends” star not-so-subtle notes about his nearly completed, six-story digs on East Sixth Street.
“Ross is not cool,” read one message emblazoned across a construction board this week — referring to the name of his quirky sitcom character.
The graffiti work — which was scrubbed away by workers soon after photos were posted on the East Village blog evgrieve.
com Monday — is the latest in a series of local protests against Schwimmer and his luxe, 9,000-square-foot manse.
Schwimmer bought the property, a five-story 1852 town house described as “one of the finest homes in the East Village,” for $4.
1 million in 2010 — and then reduced it to rubble just months after the city notified him that the building could get landmark status by the end of 2012.
The actor’s architect then produced plans for a massive new home to rise in its place, replete with elevator and roof terrace.
Some scrawled messages to him on boards and signs near the site.
“The destruction of an irreplaceable historic building for what.
” The former 7,750-square-foot town house had been one of the oldest on the block, just two doors down from the Community Synagogue, a National Historic Landmark.
“It’s really giving the middle finger to the neighborhood,” said Pete, a 43-year-old artist who lives nearby.
A worker at the new house yesterday confirmed that it’s being built for Schwimmer.
“It is what it is,” the worker said.
“Because he’s got a lot of money, I’ve got a job.
” Greg Bahdanowycz, 34, the manager of nearby coffee shop Elsewhere Espresso, said: “Personally I’m for it.
I just thank God it’s not [becoming] a towering condominium.
As many political experts have pointed out, the questions surrounding the long-standing dominance and subsequent effects of party politics have never been easy to answer – perhaps because they are as varied and complex as Queens itself.
Some in the borough contended that dominant parties make it more difficult for political neophytes to enter the fray while others said that the traditional political machines have made strides to better represent Queens’ diverse and ever-growing population.
“Newcomers to politics often find it challenging to mount competitive campaigns for state elections due to the difficulty of raising funds without institutional support,” said Rachael Fauss, director of public policy for Citizens Union (CU).
“The backing of the party continues to play a large role in elections, often making or breaking campaigns for office.
And absent reforms to the state’s campaign finance system, voters will continue to have few choices at the polls.
” In 2011, a 22-year-old Queens student’s quest to run as an independent for retiring Assemblywoman Nettie Mayersohn’s seat was dashed when the city’s board of elections ruled that a technicality invalidated more than 1,500 signatures the student had collected.
The party nomination was ultimately given to Michael Simanowitz, a former aide to Mayersohn.
In fact, statistics from CU underscored that when comparing state elections with city elections, voters have fewer choices, due to the strength of the city’s public matching system.
Some of the troubling stats showed that 21 percent of all state legislative contests in New York City went uncontested in both the primary and general elections in four cycles between 2006 and 2012 while only 8 percent of races were uncontested for the City Council during the three cycles between 2005 and 2013.
And, in primaries with incumbents, fewer than 20 percent of state legislative primaries in the city had three or more candidates from 2006 to 2012, while 59 percent of city council primaries had three or more candidates from 2005 to 2013.
“Party bosses and powerbrokers rule and the citizens of Queens are always left out of the equation,” Whelan said in an emailed statement.
Whelan, in agreement with Fauss, also noted that many primary challenges in the borough end up stalled, mainly due to new candidates’ inability to fundraise with party-backed incumbents as well as “pressure” from the political organizations themselves.
She also pointed out that State Sen.
Tony Avella (D-Bayside) had “defected” to the Independent Democrats, who help to jointly run the State Senate with the GOP.
“Avella’s defection has angered Chairman and U.
Joseph Crowley (D-Jackson Heights), who recruited former City Comptroller John Liu to challenge him in the upcoming primary,” Whelan noted.
A spokesperson for Crowley as well as Avella did not respond by press time to requests for comment.
Whelan also said that while these political dramas are unfolding, “ordinary voters are left out of the process.
” She also lamented the dearth of Republican representation in the borough.
“Out of 53 elected officials in Queens only one Republican.
The unbalance and misrepresentation of the people’s voices of Queens is a disgrace.
” But, some said that party politics isn’t necessarily a bad thing.
“I would say that any party organization has to balance two competing goals—to protect its incumbents and to incorporate new and growing groups,” said Professor Michael Krasner, who teaches political science at Queens College.
Krasner said that while the Queens Democratic Party has struggled to integrate new and growing groups in the borough, they are making some progress, such as with some Asian groups and the rise of one of the borough’s newest members of Congress U.
He also pointed out that, to its credit, the party has added a new set of district leaders in an attempt to provide representation and satisfaction to new groups, but the “question of whether or not these groups have been sufficiently represented will always be a subjective one.
” Queens’ attorney and former Mark Weprin staffer Ali Najmi had been rumored in the media to be mulling a primary challenge to state Assemblyman David Weprin (D-Fresh Meadows), but Najmi never did announce any type of political campaign.
However, Najmi, noting that candidates need a “wide base of support,” has said that many people have encouraged him to run for office.
But he said he is “committed” to helping get other Democrats elected this year.
Still other Queens political insiders said that the Queens County Democratic Party is reluctant to embrace candidates with questionable reputations, such as was the case with former Democratic District Leader Albert Baldeo, who was arrested in 2012 on federal fraud charges accusing him of using fake donors to fatten his campaign coffers.
Moreover, political operatives also said they believed both parties have problems promoting candidates who reflect the racial diversity of the borough.
Some even said that may be the reason why Meng was given support over Elizabeth Crowley or Rory Lancman for a Congressional seat.
Another political insider pointed out that elected offices, routinely covered in the media, are actually not the problem but rather the way judicial positions are selected.
The insider cited a NY Times letter from 1982 calling out Democrats for how un-democratic the process by which Queens Democrats pick judges.
They also added that this system is still how the county elects its judicial candidates who always win.
“The reason this is a bigger problem is because nobody knows anything about these offices or the nomination process…,” the insider said.

Edwize readers may find the name of the legal firm providing union-busting advice — Jackson, Lewis — familiar.
Back in November 2005, we attended incognito a similar seminar for “union prevention” in New York State charter schools, and wrote about it here.
Jackson, Lewis and its Atlantic Legal Foundation organized the day and provided the legal counsel, and Rod Paige of the “NEA is a terrorist organization” fame provided the luncheon talk.
Previously, the New York Charter School Association — also in attendance at the seminar — had introduced Jackson, Lewis and the Atlantic Legal Foundation to the New York charter world through a workshop at its annual convention.
Amazingly enough, there are still a blogger or two who claims that NYCSA is not controlled by right wing, dyed in the wool anti-union ideologues, despite its relationship with Jackson, Lewis and its financial support from far right foundations.
This morning’s NAEP scores for 4th and 8th grade reading and math just tangled the picture as far as New York State’s achievement tests are concerned.
NAEP is the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the achievement tests that are widely viewed as the best indicators available of student achievement across the 50 states.
This morning the 2007 results were announced and compared to 2005, the last time these tests were given.
The NAEP results call into question just how valid the New York State tests are.
Well, you can’t compare scores directly on these two tests.
The scales of the NAEP tests (0-500) and our own state standardized achievement tests (200-800) are different, and how the feds and the state set proficiency levels also differs.
BUT the direction of the results should be roughly the same.

] It is disturbing to learn that the Independent Budget Office’s analysis shows that fully 61% of New York City’s public school kindergarten to third-grade classrooms exceeded the state’s early grade class size standard of 20 students per class last year.
That target is part and parcel of the early grade class size reduction initiatives approved by the state 10 years ago and was based on what many researchers and educational experts consider best for effectively teaching children.
There is universal agreement on class size reduction in the early grades; the question is why is it not happening for all the city’s students in kindergarten through third grade and how do we make it happen.
More » Math and reading scores on the 2007 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) are set for release Tuesday (9/25), and should function as a revealing “audit” of the New York State ELA and math tests following two years of increasing controversy over the state assessments.
When the state reading scores rose dramatically in 2005, the N.
Times featured City Council hearings in which experts testified about their concerns over the possible gaming or misuse of state tests in an increasingly high-stakes, driven education environment.
More recently, the Daily News called into question the comparability of math tests from year to year.
Sun, citing an internal UFT research report, noted just recently that there were questions about the comparability of 4th grade ELA tests from 2004 to 2005 after the city’s 10-point gain.
In schools, there has been widespread skepticism about the validity and reliability of state tests, especially as they become more and more the sole measure of student, teacher and school performance.
It seemed to many teachers that the 2005 ELA test was easier.
The state does not release the details of how it scores the tests so there isn’t any surefire proof.
But the fact is that a 10-point gain in one year is suspect.
Tests are not perfect instruments, and they cannot always be perfectly adjusted in the scoring.
What will we learn when the 2007 results come out Tuesday.

Five Things People Do to Hurt Their Careers -- And How to Stop Doing Them These days, the barrier to advancing is more likely to be self-constructed.
That's right: Your own worst workplace nemesis is you.
The first day of school is adorably confusing for freshmen high school students.
One earnest young man had already come to my class twice before stumbling in five minutes late to his actual, scheduled English block, and two young ladies tumbled breathlessly into my room at the end of the day, explaining that they aren’t sure what had happened, but that they had somehow missed English.
“It’s fine, it’s fine,” I tell them over and over, “everything is going to be fine.
” When it comes to the sophomores, the first day of school is a day for fronting.
Last year, we wrote, read, made meaning, cried, hollered and sweated together, and we forged a beautiful community.
This year, they swagger into school, walking bigger, talking bigger.
I still catch them, though, sneaking into the seats at the back of my room, seeking comfort and familiarity in the little space we shared so much in last year.
They’ll build new classroom communities this year, with different teachers and different classmates, but I hope they’ll still seek me out for a hug between classes or an early morning check-in.
Do they know that I need it as much as they do.
Don’t tell the kids, but the first day of school is a day of fronting for me too, of putting up a façade that covers all manner of concerns.
How quickly can I learn the names of my 120 new students, and can I do it without any of them feeling the hurt I used to feel when a teacher just didn’t seem to find me memorable.
Will these students be kind to each other.
Will I be able to push each to their capacity, or more importantly, convince them to push themselves to their capacity.
Will I have the energy to constantly modify for each class as they need.
I am certain of how I will begin the first week, what I will bring to our class, but beyond that, as the classroom shifts from my space to ours, the uncertainties loom large.
Still, with a smile on my face: “It’s fine, it’s fine; everything is going to be fine.
” More » You don’t understand, Miss.
I’m peeeeeiiiing,” Samantha says on the third day of school.
Her request reminds me of Nora, a student from last year.
Both Samantha and Nora chose to loudly request to go to the bathroom as they entered the classroom just the day after I explained to my high school students the process for silently asking to go only after the first 10 minutes of class had passed.
When Nora tried that move last year, I remember being caught without a proper response.
I did not know who I was as a teacher yet.
I wanted to appear nice, but also unyielding.
I wanted Nora to know that I cared about her but also that I was the boss of my math classroom.
I wanted to show the whole class that I was reasonable, but I also wanted to show them that the expectations I had put in place for them were real.
The semblance of confidence in myself as a teacher that I had mustered together for those first few days of school withered in the face of this seemingly minor challenge.
After about 17 too many seconds of thought, I meekly asked her if she really needed to go right that second.
She nodded with conviction, grabbed the bathroom pass from my hands and skipped out the door with a triumphant smile on her face, taking my dignity and authority as a teacher with her.
More » A lot of middle schools have closed these past ten years in New York City and a whole lot more have opened up.
In fact, nearly a third of our middle schools are new, and when we look at the higher need schools, the proportion jumps to 43%.
These new schools opened as part of a reform agenda whose ideas are simple and familiar to all of us: empower principals to pick their staff and then focus “like a laser” on achievement.
Hold the staff accountable; threaten schools with closure if they fail.
And if you do that, the theory goes, they will be far more likely to succeed.
The state has designated 100 middle schools in NYC as Focus schools.
New schools are over-represented: One third of the middle schools are new schools, but they represent 40% of the Focus list.
43% of the higher need middle schools are new, but they represent 58% of the higher-need schools on the Focus list Details follow, but what this means is that, at least according to the state, once new schools reach high concentrations of high-need kids, they are overwhelmed by the same challenges as the old schools down the block.
More » Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson gets it.
He’s has enough of the teacher bashing that passes for education reform in some quarters.
It has become fashionable to blame all of society’s manifold sins and wickedness on “teachers unions,” as if it were possible to separate these supposedly evil organizations from the dedicated public servants who belong to them.
News flash: Collective bargaining is not the problem, and taking that right away from teachers will not fix the schools.
The fact is that teachers are being saddled with absurdly high expectations.
Some studies have shown a correlation between student performance and teacher “effectiveness,” depending how this elusive quality is measured.
But there is a whole body of academic literature proving the stronger correlation between student performance and a much more important variable: family income.
Yes, I’m talking about poverty.
Sorry to be so gauche, but when teachers point out the relationship between income and achievement, they’re not shirking responsibility.
They’re just stating an inconvenient truth.
The whole thing is worth a read » For the 27 years I have worked in New York City public schools, the best part of my day has been the time spent in the classroom, teaching my students.
When I engaged young people in the dialogue and discussion that is the heart and soul of learning and intellectual awakening, I felt a sense of meaning and purpose unlike anything I experienced in other work I have done.
That’s why teachers are so passionate about the work we do with our students.
In an age when the denigration of public service and teaching by the wealthy and powerful has reached a fever pitch unimaginable only a few short years ago, the time we spend teaching our students provides us with a daily reminder of the amazing grace that is our teaching vocation.
Every day, we create and nurture significant educational relationships with our students and with each other.
Every day, these relationships save lives that would be otherwise lost.
Every day, these relationships allow our students to realize untapped potential and explore new possibilities.
The redemptive power of these educational relationships gives us the fortitude and the wisdom we need to overcome the vicious assaults on our labor and our schools.
We know the truth of our work as teachers in ways that no vain and self-involved politician, no shallow Hollywood movie and no campaign of disparagement and demoralization can ever undo.
In the five years I have served as a vice president of the UFT, my time in the classroom has become even more important to me.
In the negotiations and meetings that have taken up much of my time as a union officer, the denizens of City Hall and Tweed have invariably approached the issues before us from a political — not an educational — perspective.
From the mayor and his deputy mayors to the chancellor and his deputy chancellors, they have focused on a political agenda, a brand of “education reform” that seeks to remake public schools in the image and likeness of private, for-profit corporations.
In their dystopian vision of an educational future ruled by monetary incentives and profit-making enterprises, there is no place for authentic teacher voice rooted in our classes and our schools.
My own daily experience in the classroom provided me with a moral authority to challenge those who want to silence teacher voice.
And my students provided a welcome haven from the so-called reformers’ cynical politics.
The wonderful thing about teenagers is that there is little artifice and guile in their communication: They let adults know very quickly and directly how they feel and why they feel that way.
The life of a teacher has its own distinctive rhythms, its own calendar.
The most important season, our time of hope and expectation, comes in those first days of September when we begin anew the process of teaching and learning with new classes of students.
For 27 years, I have lived this season of hope in New York City public schools, from Clara Barton HS to Bard HS Early College.
But in the coming year, I will be leaving New York City schools and my position as UFT vice president for academic high schools to take on new work as executive director of the Albert Shanker Institute at the American Federation of Teachers.
This is not a change that I make easily, or that I make without regret — most important, the regret of beginning this school year without standing in front of a new class.
But the prospect of leading the AFT’s policy think tank is a unique opportunity to promote teacher voice and union voice in educational policy debates.
Today, our impoverished public discourse on American education is dominated by those who never taught an actual class or led a real school and those whose brief journeys through the world of teaching did not last long enough to even discover what they did not know.
Proud in their ignorance, they pass uninformed judgment on our work and advocate policies that can only do harm to the students we teach and care for.
The voice of teachers needs to be heard in that educational policy world, and that will now be my work.
The UFT is an extraordinary community of educators, dedicated to public service and acting in solidarity with each other.
It has been an honor to represent that community as an officer of this union.
And I will be proud to be your tribune in the debates over the future of the nation’s public schools.
Thank you to all of those who have reached out on behalf of New York City Charter High School for Architecture, Engineering and Construction Industries (AECI) teachers.

ICHNYA, Ukraine - The ammunition is stacked in mounds in a clearing, exposed to rain and sun.
The crates that hold it are rotting.
After more than a decade in the elements, many have ruptured, exposing high-explosive rockets and mortar fins.
This is the overstuffed ammunition depot behind the security fences at Military Unit A1479, a small base in the Ukrainian forest under military guard.
At least 5,700 tons of ammunition, grenades and explosive powder have come to rest here, according to an unclassified NATO inventory.
Much of it has expired, and some is considered too unreliable or too unsafe to use.
The scenes at Unit A1479 provide a glimpse of a dangerous legacy of the militarized Soviet state, one that has emerged as a risk to post-Soviet states and to nations far away, endangering local environments and communities and providing a reservoir of lethal materials for terrorists and armed groups.
[Though recent history has shown how fluid and dangerous the arms can be, there has been no indication or allegation that munitions from Ukraine were used in the bombings last week in London.
] Huge depots of conventional weapons and ammunition remain in much of the former Soviet borderlands, many of them vulnerable to the elements, inadequately secured or watched over by security agencies with histories of corruption and suspicious arms sales.
Largely unaddressed while Western nations and post-Soviet states have worked to secure and dispose of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, the conventional stockpiles pose problems as yet unsolved.
Nowhere are these problems known to be more pronounced than in Ukraine.
NATO and the Ukrainian military estimate that the Soviet military left 2.
5 million tons of conventional munitions here as it withdrew soldiers and arms from Europe, as well as more than 7 million rifles, pistols, mortars and machine guns.
The imbalance is deeply disproportionate; the Ukrainian military now numbers roughly 300,000.
The surplus weapons and ammunition, some dating to World War I and stored in at least 184 military posts around the country, is packed in bunkers, locked in salt mines and sitting in the open air.
Shipments of the more modern mat�riel have left Ukraine in suspicious arms deals and reappeared in conflicts in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
Western governments worry that some stocks, including explosives and portable antiaircraft missiles that can down civilian aircraft, may end up with terrorist groups.
In one deal alone, extensively documented by the United Nations and human rights organizations, the Ukrainian state arms export agency transferred 68 tons of munitions in 1999 to Burkina Faso, in West Africa.
From there, they were shipped to Liberia, ending up in the hands of the Revolutionary United Front, which sacked Sierra Leone.
[Ukraine has not been alone in such circuitous deals.
Amnesty International released a report on July 5 that 400 tons of surplus ammunition was shipped from Albania and Serbia to Rwanda in 2002 and 2003, and then channeled to armed groups in Congo.
] Allegations of illegal arms dealing have also surrounded Trans-Dneister, the breakaway region of Moldova that according to estimates provided by Russia to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has 42,000 small arms and 20,000 tons of munitions, including aircraft bombs, rockets and 39,000 landmines.
Belarus, Georgia and the Central Asian states were similarly left with unwanted depots, although their stocks are believed to be much smaller than Ukraine's because they did not become depositories for munitions being withdrawn from Eastern Europe.
Russia, where depot explosions are reported each year, is thought to have the largest stockpiles of all, but it has been less forthcoming about them than Ukraine.
One concentration is in the small Russian enclave in Kaliningrad, between Poland and Lithuania, said Aaron Karp, a consultant at the Small Arms Survey, a private research organization in Geneva.
"The usual assumption is that Kaliningrad is explosive," he said.
Such stockpiles endanger global security not only because they may arm rebel groups, but also because military munitions can readily be disassembled and their explosives used to make powerful bombs.
This risk is among the prospective worries in Ukraine.
"Based on the record of the Ukrainian military over the last several years, in diverse settings, there is a certain probability that it might sell explosives to terrorists," said Andreas Heinemann-Gruder, a senior researcher at the Bonn International Center for Conversion, a private organization working on demilitarization and military conversion that has studied the Ukrainian stockpiles.
"Sectors of the Ukrainian military have cooperated with whoever offered them money, and there have been no moral considerations.
" The dangers are not limited to the munitions' travels and use.
Ukrainian officials and military analysts have warned that as Soviet-era munitions have aged, environmental and safety risks have mounted.
This was made clear last year when a depot exploded near Melitopol, in the south, scattering tons of ammunition in the surrounding countryside.
The blasts killed five people and forced the evacuation of at least 5,000 more.
The concerns over accidental explosions were evident here in Ichnya, where firefighting equipment was neatly arranged near the gate and laborers hacked at saplings and thigh-high grass, removing material that might kindle flame or block the passage of the depot's armored fire trucks.
Throughout the depot, which consists of 47 warehouses and 47 house-size stacks of ammunition, the military has erected 80-feet-high lightning rods to divert lightning from ammunition stores.
At least two of the rods have been struck, said the depot commander, Col.
Amid the mounting safety and security concerns, Western sponsors are trying to accelerate the disposal of Ukraine's arms burden.
The efforts include a $30 million NATO program expected to start this fall that plans to destroy 133,000 tons of munitions, 1.
5 million guns and 1,000 portable antiaircraft missiles known as manpads, which could be used to disrupt air traffic worldwide.
The program will last 12 years.
It will be the largest effort in the world to destroy surplus munitions, according to Michel Duray, a NATO spokesman in Ukraine.
The United States is a principal sponsor, donating more than $1.
Donors and Ukrainian military officials caution that it is only a start.
Ukraine has been trying to destroy its surplus inventory since 1993, but at the current pace the disposal will last another 50 years or more.
"We will have to spend some decades to reach a level of moderate safety," said Leonid Polyakov, Ukraine's first deputy minister of defense, who assumed his post this year in the new government of President Viktor A.
Before joining the government, Mr.
Polyakov was director of military programs at the Oleksandr Razumkov Center in Kiev, a nonprofit organization that studies politics, economics and security.
While there, he wrote a report for the Bonn center that recommended collective international action to reduce Ukraine's burden.
Ukraine's munitions centers are filled beyond capacity, he wrote, leaving at least 60 percent of the ammunition exposed to the elements.
Most of the ammunition has exceeded its shelf life.
At least 15 percent is also unstable enough that it risks exploding from handling, electricity, heat or chemical reaction.
Moreover, Soviet soldiers packed much of it with inadequate spacing between stacks, which has made it more difficult and dangerous to fight or contain fires.
Volodymyr Tereschenko, a deputy minister of defense charged with munitions disposal, also said Ukraine's budget constraints had prevented the installation of better security features, including adequate lighting, fencing and walls, electronic sensors, video surveillance and water reservoirs around important caches.
Ukrainian officials suspect the existing security has been thwarted, as recently as last winter, when two manpads are thought to have been stolen from a depot in the Crimea.
"We have had several cases when manpads disappeared," Mr.
He added that these missiles, because of the dangers they pose, were guarded more closely than most other munitions.
He also noted that the government did not disclose which depots had stockpiles, or how many missiles Ukraine possessed in all, other than to say there are at least 10,000.
"We want not to provoke too much interest," he said.
Polyakov also noted that in Ukraine, a nation sullied by its reputation for public corruption, security was only as good as the integrity of those watching over the far-flung depots.
"We cannot exclude that there were corrupt schemes between criminal businesses and officials in the previous government," he said.
Details of a few schemes have surfaced in the past, most notably the transfer of Ukrainian arms in 1999 through Burkina Faso to Liberia to the Revolutionary United Front.
When the United Nations investigated, Ukraine claimed that it had properly issued the certificates intended to ensure the arms had a legal destination.
But the deal was suspicious on its face.
The military in Burkina Faso principally uses NATO-standard arms, and would not be expected to buy large quantities of post-Soviet equipment.
The weapons were promptly shuttled to Liberia on a plane owned by a well-known international crime figure, Leonid Minin, the United Nations found.
Minin's partners was also involved in 2000 in the transfer of 103 tons of Ukrainian munitions to the Ivory Coast where, the United Nations later reported, the ammunition was split between the Ivory Coast and Liberia, which was under an international arms embargo.
These deals, made through false declarations and obscure companies and involving linked networks of criminals, governments and insurgents, showed how mobile post-Soviet arms stockpiles could be, and how Ukraine, unwittingly or no, helped arm rebel bands for war.
Even disposing of old munitions poses severe technical challenges.
Tereschenko said, involves stocks of PFM land mines, small antipersonnel devices that the Soviet Union deployed extensively in Afghanistan by simply scattering them on the ground.
The mines, which contain a liquid explosive, are now too unstable to handle, raising a baffling question: how do you dispose of munitions you cannot touch.
Ukraine has about six million such mines.
There are other logistical and safety issues as well.
The few facilities in Ukraine now capable of disposing of munitions are far from most depots, meaning that unless special arrangements were made, ammunition would have to be moved through Ukraine on public roads and rail lines.
"There is a whole complex of problems, many of which cause a great threat and danger," Mr.
"The tragedy of Ukraine is not our own only.
" Correction: Monday, July 18: A credit on Saturday for a front-page picture of rotting boxes of mortar rounds at a Ukraine arms depot misspelled the photographer's surname.
He was Nikolai Khalip, not Khalap.
If you try to visit the website for Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson’s All Day Foundation today, you will instead be greeted by this message, explaining why the charity has decided to take the site offline: Following Peterson’s indictment on charges of reckless or negligent injury of a child, the foundation’s partners have allegedly been receiving “harassment” from those who oppose the NFL star’s discipline techniques.
In its statement, the foundation takes aim at the media for paying “little attention to our nonprofit partners” when there was positive news about the charity, but turning against them in light of the latest news.
The All Day foundation has previously raised funds for the Special Olympics, but on Monday that organization decided to sever ties with Peterson.
In addition, multiple major sporting goods stores, including the Nike store at the Mall of America, have pulled Peterson’s jersey and other merchandise from shelves.
In Long Island Rail Road East Side Access Project news, the MTA just announced it has completed the 3rd Queens tunnel ahead of schedule.
More via press release: Last night, crews working on the MTA’s East Side Access project brought a 642-ton tunnel boring machine to a halt underneath Sunnyside Yard in Queens seven weeks […] Earlier today New York Senators Charles Schumer & Hillary Clinton announced the official approval of funding for the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) East Side Access project.
The funding will come in the form of a $210 million dollar grant from the U.
Steve Ritea of Newsday filed this brief report: Sens.
[…] The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) has many projects that are important to its operations.
While many would say the East Side Access project is the most important, I will respectfully disagree.
I feel the most important project for the Long Island Rail Road is the creation of a third track on the main line.
[…] 13 days ago the MTA issued a press release to announce that the first tunnel boring machine reached Grand Central Terminal as part of the Long Island Rail Road’s East Side Access project.
Now they are inviting photographers & reporters to tour the recently dug tunnel.
Here is all the information courtesy of MTA Headquarters: […] The MTA has issued a press release to highlight the first East Side Access tunnel boring machine reached Grand Central Terminal.

Am not able to enter food into lunch, dinner, or snack without it kicking me out.
Only breakfast and indulgences.
Also, we get 7 pts for indulgences so what if I wanted TWO spoons of honey in my tea.
There is no way to enter more than one of any item.
The app won't flip horizontal with my iPad and will not even turn right side up unless it is in ONE certain position which is a bother in the kitchen when I'm looking up a part of a recipe, stirring with one hand and reaching out for the iPad with the other.
Seemed like a dumb thing to overlook.
Oh, and the BEST part is that MAYBE customer service will call me back in a week.
The program only LASTS a week, people.
So let's recap: not only is it NOT user friendly, but it doesn't even let you do the ONE thing it was designed for.
TO ENTER FOOD INTO THE DESIGNATED TIME SLOTS.
(and in the appropriate amounts.
) This is such a shame because the app is a wonderful idea and the pictures and information are top notch.
Just another example of people not taking pride in their work :/ The point is to lose weight I agree with many that there are some small issues that would WW change, would get the app 5 stars, but overall, did it work.
Is it helping me lose weight and stay on track.
A running total of indulgence points would be cool and not being able to enter the same indulgence is a bit mind boggling.
did they not think someone would have 30 or 45 small pretzels in a day.
Right now, you just have to remember or click on something else you didn't eat that had the same points.
Overall, a good and helpful app, with some adjustments listed in all these reviews, it would be excellent.
This app is missing two features for me.
First, it is missing list of power foods for me to view and access when I create my own meal.
Second, a running record of my indulgences for the day and the week would be nice so to know how many indulgence points I have left.
No matter what you call it, this is really the simply filling plan with no way to track my "indulges.
" It is just too hard to keep track of these points in my head.
I have too many other important things to think about.
Third, why doesn't it sync between my iPad and phone.
Really this app could be so much better.
If it was not for the recipe ideas this app would be a ware.
I do love the recipes in this app.
They are the only reason I am giving the app two stars.
The veil covering makes this even more creepy.

Miriam Leslie (June 5, 1836 – September 18, 1914) was an American publisher and author.
She was the wife of Frank Leslie and the heir to his publishing business which she developed into a paying concern from a state of precarious indebtedness.
She was born Miriam Florence Folline in New Orleans, Louisiana.
She was the descendant of a noble Huguenot family.
After a trip to France, in 1901, she claimed the title Baroness de Bazus.
She apparently grew up in New York City, and was well educated in the French, Spanish and Italian languages.
[1] She was married four times.
Her first marriage, March 25, 1854, was to David Charles Peacock.
[1] That marriage was annulled two years later, and she married her second husband, the anthropologist Ephraim Squier.
[2] When the editor of Frank Leslie's Lady's Magazine had fallen ill, probably in the late 1860s, she volunteered to fill in while the ill editor still received the salary.
The editor died, and she took on the position permanently,[3] the November 18, 1871, issue of the magazine appearing with the notation “conducted by Miriam F.
”[1] She divorced Ephraim Squier on May 31, 1873, to marry publisher Frank Leslie.
[1] During their honeymoon, the couple met Western poet and author Joaquin Miller.
Leslie and Miller began an affair and the main character in his book The One Fair Woman was modeled after her.
[4] The Leslies' summer home was in Saratoga Springs, New York, where they entertained many notables, and she was a leader in society.
[3] In 1877, they took a lavish train trip with a numerous retinue from New York City to San Francisco.
She wrote her recollections of this trip in her book From Gotham to the Golden Gate.
The expense of the trip, and a business depression left Leslie's business badly in debt.
[1] When Frank Leslie died in 1880, the debts amounted to $300,000, and his will was contested.
Miriam Leslie took the business in hand and put it on a paying basis, even going so far as to having her name legally changed to Frank Leslie in June 1881.
[3] She later effected a reorganization of the business, and became its president.
The circulation of the Popular Monthly increased 200,000 in four months under her management.
While abroad in 1891, Miriam Leslie married Willie Wilde, the older brother of Oscar Wilde, but two years later was divorced from him.
In 1902 she sold out all her publishing interests.
By her will she made Carrie Chapman Catt residuary legatee, in the expectation that most of her fortune would be devoted to women's suffrage.
Her remains are buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.

Queens Borough President Melinda Katz cooed to boyfriend Curtis Sliwa about his bedroom prowess in racy phone messages while the Guardian Angels founder was still married, his ex-wife claims in court papers.
“Last night was not about you going home,” Katz said in a July 2010 message on Sliwa’s voicemail — over six months before he left wife Mary Sliwa.
“Last night was about the fact that you are capable of making love to me twice,” Katz allegedly said.
Transcripts of 19 steamy phone messages and incriminating emails that allegedly reveal intimate details of the borough president’s years-long affair with radio personality Sliwa were filed in Manhattan Supreme Court Wednesday by lawyers for his jilted ex.
“You should remember that when you married Mary, you were with me the night before you left for the wedding,” Katz allegedly said in another July 2010 message.
The hot and heavy conversations were filed in support of Mary’s $1 million Manhattan lawsuit against the duo, who now live together in Forest Hills with their two sons.
Sliwa admitted in a separate Family Court proceeding in December that he had given Mary access to his email and phone so she could handle calls for the Guardian Angels, where she worked as an executive director during their 12-year marriage.
In another July 2010 message, Katz castigates Sliwa for not calling her even though her sheets were “still…wet” and she “still [had him] dripping out of me.
” The allegedly two-timed Mary said Curtis “devastated” their special needs son when he left to live with Katz in 2011.
She calls Katz a “money-loving homewrecker who relentlessly plotted for years to destroy my marriage, my family and me.
” In her suit, filed in May, Mary Sliwa accuses Katz and her then-husband of siphoning off over $400,000 in tax-free child support payments from their marital assets.
Katz revealed in an exclusive interview with The Post in 2012, that the secret sperm donor who was the daddy of the two boys she claims to have had through in-vitro fertilization, was her longtime “friend” Curtis Sliwa.
But Mary calls the frozen sperm story “a fairy tale,” adding, “no sane person would believe that Katz used ancient sperm when she was frequently and repeatedly receiving my husband’s fresh sperm during sexual intercourse.
” She claims that her ex and his new girlfriend committed perjury by telling the court in June that they were not having an affair.
Katz spokesman Nathan Smith said, “We have not had the opportunity to review the materials and, therefore, can’t speak specifically to their contents,” adding, “Curtis’ ex-wife is furious about recently losing her $13,000 a month payment from that settlement and this is her reaction.
” Sliwa and his attorney did not return messages seeking comment.
A grand jury this week handed up indictments against more than 30 alleged borough gang members on charges of conspiring to murder two rival gang members and conspiring to commit robberies in order to raise bail money for an alleged gang leader on Rikers Island.
The 31 defendants, who range in age from 15 to 22, are reputed members of SNOW, Loyalty Over Everything and Young Bosses street gangs.
Seventeen defendants have been charged in the retaliation-murder plot; while the other 16 defendants were charged with conspiring to commit robbery.
“In thwarting their plans, police, it is alleged, recovered a loaded defaced handgun and a vehicle that had been stolen and was being used by gang members,” Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said.
“Under the second indictment, an alleged leader of the SNOW gang is accused of brazenly assuming that he could continue to run criminal activities from his jail cell—specifically, order other gang members to commit robberies so that they could raise bail monies to secure his release from jail.
Unfortunately for him his plan failed and his associates, if convicted, will join him behind bars.
” According to the DA’s office, the long-term investigation—which was spearheaded by the city Police Department’s Queens Gang Squad, the NYPD’s 113th Precinct’s Strategic Enforcement Team and District Attorney Brown’s Career Criminal Major Crimes Bureau—utilized various investigative techniques, including the monitoring of conversations spread out on more than 1.
1 million Facebook pages belonging to gang members in which gang members allegedly discussed reputed gang leader Daquan Monroe’s orders to commit robberies and how to go about achieving the goal; and by listening to recorded telephone conversation made from Rikers Island by Monroe to his cousin and co-defendant, Michael Paradise.
“The arrests and indictments of these SNOW gang members and their affiliates sends a clear message that the New York City Police Department, along with our partners from the Queens District Attorney’s Office, will continue to rid our communities of gang activity and gun violence,” Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said.
The defendants allegedly operated generally in Rosedale, Laurelton and Rochdale Village, Brown said.
“These indictments are another example of police and prosecutors working together to eliminate gang violence that too often plagues our neighborhoods,” Brown noted, “and strikes at the heart of a unified and criminally active group of young people who threaten the lives and safety of innocent bystanders.
Whether you are hitting your quarter life crisis, midlife crisis, or no crisis at all, deciding what you should be doing with the rest of your life can be terrifying.
But sometimes, the unknown can open up more opportunities than you once thought.
Believe it or not, it might lead you to a job in IT.
If you just read this and thought, “that doesn’t sound like me,” you might want to think again.
Take Rebecca Baca, who was not exactly the cookie-cutter image of an IT professional.
At 27 years old, the single mother mostly had experience in the food industry, and was not what people would call a computer whiz.
But in order to better provide for her child, Baca decided it was time for a fresh start.
She enrolled in a Cisco Networking Academy class in 2003 and never looked back.
“When I started, I couldn’t even attach an email,” she said.
“It was ridiculous; I didn’t know how to work Excel.
” Now, Baca is the first woman in her organization to be promoted to project consulting engineer.
Ty James, on the other hand, knew he loved computers ever since he was a little kid.
After working as a computer technician for a few years, he is now a Cisco Networking Academy instructor for 11th and 12th grade students.
“I’ve always loved working with computers,” he said.
“Back in the '90s when home computers were evolving, I got into that in high school.
It's really just been a part of my life since then.
” So, do you have what it takes to make this kind of career move.
Presented by Cisco and in tandem with CEO John Chambers' speech at the Clinton Global Initiative, we're bringing you the qualities that you REALLY need in order to succeed in an IT job.
And believe it or not, calculator watches and a love of all things 1 and 0 are nowhere to be found.
Or, You Have No Idea How To Use One.
Angel Gavidia This story is told time and again by people in the IT realm.
“During my studies and when I was at my job, I met people from all walks of life,” said Angel Gavidia, a previous Cisco Networking Academy student.
“Some people were English majors and irrigation specialists.
[and] all these people came from previous careers that had little or nothing to do with technology in general.
” However, Gavidia himself has always been a bit of a tech fanatic.
“Ever since I was young, I was always playing around with electronic systems.
Back when computers were just as simple as word processing with the green screens, I’ve always wanted to tinker around with that.
” Whether you go gaga over gadgets or have barely even touched a computer mouse, people with all kinds of backgrounds can find themselves in IT.
You Are Creative Rebecca Baca Creativity and problem-solving are not mutually exclusive skill sets.
As Baca says, “Every robot has a manual.
" In other words, solving technical problems -- and thinking ahead to predict potential challenges -- requires creative thinking.
This truly means that artistry and technology can exist in the same world.
Gavidia, for instance, is the only IT personnel in his family; with an accountant for a father and a seamstress for a mother, it may seem like an unlikely familial connection.
However, his sister is a multimedia artist, and the two find some common ground in their lack of commonalities.
Leaders in IT have long known that hiring creative people -- and providing them with a collaborative, flexible work environment where they can unlock their creativity -- is essential to true innovation.
As Baca explains, “When there is technology, but no creativity, you box yourself in.
Puzzles Are Your Jam Ty James Every Cisco Networking Academy alumni mentioned the same thing when we discussed what qualifies someone to be an IT professional: a strong curiosity.
“I think that [IT] is something that they can grow into and learn to enjoy," says James.
"Especially if they enjoy analytical thinking and reasoning, and if they enjoy learning how to solve problems.
I’ve always enjoyed the challenge of figuring out ways of doing things and solving new problems.
” To current employers, being a good problem-solver is just as important as having technical skills.
A 2013 study commissioned by Microsoft found that problem-solving is one of the top traits required for the fastest-growing, highest-wage occupations of the next decade.
While IT skills remain important, companies are always looking for employees who have strong oral and written communication skills and can solve problems on the fly.
You Have To Be Ready And Willing To Learn All Different Kinds Of Things Shraddha Chaplot “Anyone can be technical; you just have to be able to read," says Baca.
"You have to grasp the technology and be able to apply it in different situations.
” Shraddha Chaplot, a hardware test engineer currently doing a six-month rotation in Cisco's Services Innovation Excellence Center -– or a “greengineer,” as she more succinctly calls herself -– is a perfect example of how creativity and a hunger for learning are the most essential ingredients for success in IT.
“I’m not doing the same thing every single day,” says Chaplot.
“I really want to try to influence as much as I can and learn as much as I can because that’s how I’m going to be able to make a difference.
” Chaplot also reinforces the fact that you don’t have to fit a certain type of mold to be in IT: “Innovation is not just something that is for a particular age group or a particular expertise level,” she says.
You Are A Good Communicator As both a computer technician and a teacher, James knows that communication is key.
“A lot of people may think of someone going into IT as stereotypically not the best communicator,” he said.
What the workforce needs right now is someone who does have those communication skills, and who can present what they are doing to people who are not in IT.
Along with the tech skills, they certainly need business skills as well.
” Gavidia echoed these sentiments when discussing his own experiences in school.
Although he struggled with his studies at certain points, he realized that discussing what he learned with others is what really helped him excel: “When you start explaining [the material] to someone else in your own words, you are essentially reteaching it to yourself and making the connections so that someone else will understand it.
” He went on to explain that his pathway to success really lay in these inter-student communications, and that “teaching my peers, collaborating with my peers.
There is no one way to approach a career in IT: even if you don't necessarily check all of these boxes, you just might find your niche in an exciting, constantly evolving industry.

Courtney Dupree was convicted of vastly overstating the billings of his Long Island City-based lighting company GDC Acquisitions in order to fraudulently obtain a loan from Amalgamated Bank.
Dupree, 42, sat stone-faced as the verdict was read in Brooklyn Federal Court.
He faces up to 30 years in prison and has to pay back at least $18 million.
Meanwhile, the jury that convicted Dupree also acquitted his company lawyer, Thomas Foley, 45.
“The jury rejected an FBI effort to ensnare a lawyer because of his client’s conduct and we are very grateful,” said Foley’s defense attorney, Joseph Ryan.
Dupree was done in by a mountain of paperwork, which prosecutors said proved he was a crook, and by testimony from cooperating witnesses who were involved in the scheme.
“This is a case about lying to a bank to get money,” Assistant U.
Attorney David Woll told the jury during the trial.
“It is about telling lies over and over again in order to grab millions of dollars of the bank’s money.
” Once a guard on the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill basketball team, Dupree tried to counter the damning evidence by calling in some All-Star character witnesses.
“I’ of them was an ex-NFL star running back Dorsey Levens, a member of the Green Bay Packers hall of fame and a childhood pal from Syracuse.
d trust him with my life,” Levens said.

The Sistine Chapel (Latin: Sacellum Sixtinum; Italian: Cappella Sistina) is a large and renowned chapel in the Apostolic Palace, the official residence of the Pope in the Vatican City.
Originally known as the Cappella Magna, the chapel takes its name from Pope Sixtus IV, who restored it between 1477 and 1480.
Since that time, the chapel has served as a place of both religious and functionary papal activity.
Today it is the site of the Papal conclave, the process by which a new Pope is selected.
The fame of the Sistine Chapel lies mainly in the frescos that decorate the interior, and most particularly the Sistine Chapel ceiling and The Last Judgment by Michelangelo.
During the reign of Sixtus IV, a team of Renaissance painters that included Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Pinturicchio, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Cosimo Roselli, created a series of frescos depicting the Life of Moses and the Life of Christ, offset by papal portraits above and trompe l’oeil drapery below.
These paintings were completed in 1482, and on 15 August 1483 Sixtus IV celebrated the first mass in the Sistine Chapel for the Feast of the Assumption, at which ceremony the chapel was consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary.
[3][4] Between 1508 and 1512, under the patronage of Pope Julius II, Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel ceiling, a masterpiece without precedent, that was to change the course of Western art.
[5][6] In a different climate after the Sack of Rome, he returned and between 1535 and 1541, painted The Last Judgement for Popes Clement VII and Paul III.
[7] The fame of Michelangelo's paintings has drawn multitudes of visitors to the chapel, ever since they were revealed five hundred years ago.
While known as the location of Papal conclaves, the primary function of the Sistine Chapel is as the chapel of the Papal Chapel (Cappella Pontificia), one of the two bodies of the Papal household, called until 1968 the Papal Court (Pontificalis Aula).
At the time of Pope Sixtus IV in the late 15th century, the Papal Chapel comprised about 200 people, including clerics, officials of the Vatican and distinguished laity.
There were 50 occasions during the year on which it was prescribed by the Papal Calendar that the whole Papal Chapel should meet.
[8] Of these 50 occasions, 35 were masses, of which 8 were held in Basilicas, in general St.
Peter's, and were attended by large congregations.
These included the Christmas Day and Easter masses, at which the Pope himself was the celebrant.
The other 27 masses could be held in a smaller, less public space, for which the Cappella Maggiore was used before it was rebuilt on the same site as the Sistine Chapel.
The Cappella Maggiore derived its name, the Greater Chapel, from the fact that there was another chapel also in use by the Pope and his retinue for daily worship.
At the time of Pope Sixtus IV, this was the Chapel of Pope Nicholas V, which had been decorated by Fra Angelico.
The Cappella Maggiore is recorded as existing in 1368.
According to a communication from Andreas of Trebizond to Pope Sixtus IV, by the time of its demolition to make way for the present chapel, the Cappella Maggiore was in a ruinous state with its walls leaning.
[9] The present chapel, on the site of the Cappella Maggiore, was designed by Baccio Pontelli for Pope Sixtus IV, for whom it is named, and built under the supervision of Giovannino de Dolci between 1473 and 1481.
[1] The proportions of the present chapel appear to closely follow those of the original.
After its completion, the chapel was decorated with frescoes by a number of the most famous artists of the High Renaissance, including Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Pietro Perugino, and Michelangelo.
[9] The first mass in the Sistine Chapel was celebrated on 15 August 1483, the Feast of the Assumption, at which ceremony the chapel was consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary.
[10] The Sistine Chapel has maintained its function to the present day, and continues to host the important services of the Papal Calendar, unless the Pope is travelling.
There is a permanent choir, the Sistine Chapel Choir, for whom much original music has been written, the most famous piece being Gregorio Allegri's Miserere.
[11] One of the functions of the Sistine Chapel is as a venue for the election of each successive pope in a conclave of the College of Cardinals.
On the occasion of a conclave, a chimney is installed in the roof of the chapel, from which smoke arises as a signal.
If white smoke appears, created by burning the ballots of the election, a new Pope has been elected.
If a candidate receives less than a two-thirds vote, the cardinals send up black smoke — created by burning the ballots along with wet straw and chemical additives — it means that no successful election has yet occurred.
[12] The conclave also provided for the cardinals a space in which they can hear mass, and in which they can eat, sleep, and pass time attended by servants.
From 1455, conclaves have been held in the Vatican; until the Great Schism, they were held in the Dominican convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva.
[13] Since 1996, John Paul II's Apostolic Constitution Universi Dominici Gregis requires the cardinals to be lodged in the Domus Sanctae Marthae during a papal conclave, but to continue to vote in the Sistine Chapel.
[14] Canopies for each cardinal-elector were once used during conclaves—a sign of equal dignity.
After the new Pope accepts his election, he would give his new name; at this time, the other Cardinals would tug on a rope attached to their seats to lower their canopies.
Until reforms instituted by Saint Pius X, the canopies were of different colours to designate which Cardinals had been appointed by which Pope.
Paul VI abolished the canopies altogether, since, under his papacy, the population of the College of Cardinals had increased so much to the point that they would need to be seated in rows of two against the walls, making the canopies obstruct the view of the cardinals in the back row.
The chapel is a high rectangular building, for which absolute measurements are hard to ascertain, as available measurements are for the interior: 40.
4 metres (44 ft) wide, the dimensions of the Temple of Solomon, as given in the Old Testament.
[15] Its exterior is unadorned by architectural or decorative details, as is common in many of the Medieval and Renaissance churches of Italy.
It has no exterior façade or exterior processional doorways, as the ingress has always been from internal rooms within the Apostolic Palace (Papal Palace), and the exterior can be seen only from nearby windows and light-wells in the palace.
Subsidence and cracking of masonry such as must also have affected the Cappella Maggiore has necessitated the building of very large buttresses to brace the exterior walls.
The accretion of other buildings has further altered the exterior appearance of the Chapel.
The building is divided into three stories of which the lowest is a very tall basement level with several utilitarian windows and a doorway giving onto the exterior court.
Internally, the basement is robustly vaulted to support the chapel.
Above is the main space, the Sistine Chapel, the vaulted ceiling rising to 20.
The building had six tall arched windows down each side and two at either end, several of which have been blocked.
Above the vault is a third story with wardrooms for guards.
At this level, an open projecting gangway was constructed, which encircled the building supported on an arcade springing from the walls.
The gangway has been roofed as it was a continual source of water leaking in to the vault of the Chapel.
The general proportions of the chapel use the length as the unit of measurement.
This has been divided by three to get the width and by two to get the height.
Maintaining the ratio, there were six windows down each side and two at either end.
Defined proportions were a feature of Renaissance architecture and reflected the growing interest in the Classical heritage of Rome.
The ceiling of the chapel is a flattened barrel vault springing from a course that encircles the walls at the level of the springing of the window arches.
This barrel vault is cut transversely by smaller vaults over each window, which divide the barrel vault at its lowest level into a series of large pendentives rising from shallow pilasters between each window.
The barrel vault was originally painted brilliant-blue and dotted with gold stars, to the design of Piermatteo Lauro de' Manfredi da Amelia.
[9] The pavement is in opus alexandrinum, a decorative style using marble and coloured stone in a pattern that reflects the earlier proportion in the division of the interior and also marks the processional way from the main door, used by the Pope on important occasions such as Palm Sunday.
A screen or transenna in marble by Mino da Fiesole, Andrea Bregno, and Giovanni Dalmata divides the chapel into two parts.
[16] Originally these made equal space for the members of the Papal Chapel within the sanctuary near the altar and the pilgrims and townsfolk without.
However, with growth in the number of those attending the Pope, the screen was moved giving a reduced area for the faithful laity.
The transenna is surmounted by a row of ornate candlesticks, once gilt, and has a wooden door, where once there was an ornate door of gilded wrought iron.
The sculptors of the transenna also provided the cantoria or projecting choir gallery.
The first stage in the decoration of the Sistine Chapel was the painting of the ceiling in blue, studded with gilt stars, and with decorative borders around the architectural details of the pendentives.
This was entirely replaced when Michelangelo came to work on the ceiling in 1508.
Of the present scheme of frescos, the earliest part is that of the side walls.
They are divided into three main tiers.
The central tier of the walls has two cycles of paintings, which complement each other, The Life of Moses and The Life of Christ.
They were commissioned in 1480 by Pope Sixtus IV and executed by Domenico Ghirlandaio, Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Cosimo Roselli and their workshops.
The project was perhaps supervised by Perugino, who arrived at the chapel prior to the Florentines.
It is probable that the commission of Ghirlandaio, Botticelli and Roselli was part of a reconciliation project between Lorenzo de' Medici, the de facto ruler of Florence, and Pope Sixtus IV.
The Florentines started to work in the Sistine Chapel in the Spring of 1481.
Beneath the cycles of The Life of Moses and The Life of Christ, the lower level of the walls is decorated with frescoed hangings in silver and gold.
Above the narrative frescos, the upper tier is divided into two zones.
At the lower level of the windows is a Gallery of Popes painted at the same time as the Lives.
Around the arched tops of the windows are areas known as the lunettes which contain the Ancestors of Christ, painted by Michelangelo as part of the scheme for the ceiling.
The ceiling was commissioned by Pope Julius II and painted by Michelangelo between 1508 to 1512.
The commission was originally to paint the twelve apostles on the triangular pendentives which support the vault; however, Michelangelo demanded a free hand in the pictorial content of the scheme.
He painted a series of nine pictures showing God's Creation of the World, God's Relationship with Mankind, and Mankind's Fall from God's Grace.
On the large pendentives he painted twelve Biblical and Classical men and women who prophesied that God would send Jesus Christ for the salvation of mankind, and around the upper parts of the windows, the Ancestors of Christ.
In 1515, Raphael was commissioned by Pope Leo X to design a series of ten tapestries to hang around the lower tier of the walls.
[17] The tapestries depict events from the Life of St.
Paul, the founders of the Christian Church in Rome, as described in the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles.
Due to their large size, manufacture of the hangings was carried out in Brussels, and took four years under the hands of the weavers in the shop of Pieter van Aelst.
[18] Raphael's tapestries were looted during the Sack of Rome in 1527 and were either burnt for their precious metal content or were scattered around Europe.
In the late 20th century, a set was reassembled from several further sets that had been made after the first set, and displayed again in the Sistine Chapel in 1983.
The tapestries continue in use at occasional ceremonies of particular importance.
The full-size preparatory cartoons for seven of the ten tapestries are known as the Raphael Cartoons and are in London.
[19] At this point, the decorative scheme displayed a consistent iconographical pattern.
The tier of Popes, which, in the scheme intended by Pope Julius, would have appeared immediately below the Twelve Apostles, would have emphasised the Apostolic Succession.
It has been argued that the present scheme shows the two Biblical Testaments merged in order to reveal the Old predicting and framing the New, synthesizing, the logic of the Christian Bible.
[20] This was disrupted by a further commission to Michelangelo to decorate the wall above the altar with The Last Judgment, 1537–1541.
The painting of this scene necessitated the obliteration of two episodes from the Lives, the Nativity of Jesus and the Finding of Moses; several of the Popes and two sets of Ancestors.
The southern wall is decorated with the Stories of Moses, painted in 1481–1482.
Starting from the altar, they include: The northern wall houses the Stories of Jesus, dating to 1481–1482.
They include: Michelangelo was commissioned by Pope Julius II in 1508 to repaint the vault, or ceiling, of the Chapel.
It was originally painted as golden stars on a blue sky.
The work was completed between 1508 and 2 November 1512.
[21] He painted the Last Judgment over the altar, between 1535 and 1541, on commission from Pope Paul III Farnese.
[22] Michelangelo was intimidated by the scale of the commission, and made it known from the outset of Julius II's approach that he would prefer to decline.
He felt he was more of a sculptor than a painter, and was suspicious that such a large-scale project was being offered to him by enemies as a set-up for an inevitable fall.
For Michelangelo, the project was a distraction from the major marble sculpture that had preoccupied him for the previous few years.
[23] The sources of Michelangelo's inspiration are not easily determined; both Joachite and Augustinian theologians were within the sphere of Julius influence.
[24] To be able to reach the ceiling, Michelangelo needed a support; the first idea was by Julius' favoured architect Donato Bramante, who wanted to build for him a scaffold to be suspended in the air with ropes.
However, Bramante did not successfully complete the task, and the structure he built was flawed.
He had perforated the vault in order to lower strings to secure the scaffold.
Michelangelo laughed when he saw the structure, and believed it would leave holes in the ceiling once the work was ended.
He asked Bramante what was to happen when the painter reached the perforations, but the architect had no answer.
The matter was taken before the Pope, who ordered Michelangelo to build a scaffold of his own.
Michelangelo created a flat wooden platform on brackets built out from holes in the wall, high up near the top of the windows.
Contrary to popular belief, he did not lie on this scaffolding while he painted, but painted from a standing position.
[25] Michelangelo used bright colours, easily visible from the floor.
On the lowest part of the ceiling he painted the ancestors of Christ.
Above this he alternated male and female prophets, with Jonah over the altar.
On the highest section, Michelangelo painted nine stories from the Book of Genesis.
He was originally commissioned to paint only 12 figures, the Apostles.
He turned down the commission because he saw himself as a sculptor, not a painter.
The Pope offered to allow Michelangelo to paint biblical scenes of his own choice as a compromise.
After the work was finished, there were more than 300.
His figures showed the creation, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and the Great Flood.
The painted area is about 40 m (131 ft) long by 13 m (43 ft) wide.
This means that Michelangelo painted well over 5,000 square feet (460 m2) of frescoes.
[26] The Last Judgement was painted by Michelangelo from 1535 to 1541, between two important historic events, the Sack of Rome by mercenary forces of the Holy Roman Empire in 1527 and the Council of Trent which commenced in 1545.
The work was desiqned on a grand scale, and spans the entire wall behind the altar of the Sistine Chapel.
The painting depicts the second coming of Christ on the Day of Judgement as described in the Revelation of John, Chapter 20.
High on the wall is the heroic figure of Christ, with the saints clustered in groups around him.
At the bottom left of the painting the dead are raised from their graves and ascend to be judged.
To the right are those who are assigned to Hell and are dragged down by demons.
The Last Judgement was an object of a bitter dispute between Cardinal Carafa and Michelangelo.
Because he depicted naked figures, the artist was accused of immorality and obscenity.
A censorship campaign (known as the "Fig-Leaf Campaign") was organized by Carafa and Monsignor Sernini (Mantua's ambassador) to remove the frescoes.
The Pope's Master of Ceremonies Biagio da Cesena said "it was most disgraceful that in so sacred a place there should have been depicted all those nude figures, exposing themselves so shamefully, and that it was no work for a papal chapel but rather for the public baths and taverns,"[27] In response Michelangelo worked da Cesena's semblance into the scene as Minos, judge of the underworld.
It is said that when he complained to the Pope, the pontiff responded that his jurisdiction did not extend to hell, so the portrait would have to remain.
Michelangelo also painted his own portrait, on the flayed skin held by St Bartholomew.
The genitalia in the fresco were later covered by the artist Daniele da Volterra, whom history remembers by the derogatory nickname "Il Braghettone" ("the breeches-painter").
The Sistine Chapel's ceiling restoration began on 7 November 1984.
The restoration complete, the chapel was re-opened to the public on 8 April 1994.
The part of the restoration in the Sistine Chapel that has caused the most concern is the ceiling, painted by Michelangelo.
The emergence of the brightly coloured Ancestors of Christ from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe and removed the original intent of the artist.
The problem lies in the analysis and understanding of the techniques utilised by Michelangelo, and the technical response of the restorers to that understanding.
A close examination of the frescoes of the lunettes convinced the restorers that Michelangelo worked exclusively in "buon fresco"; that is, the artist worked only on freshly laid plaster and each section of work was completed while the plaster was still in its fresh state.
In other words, Michelangelo did not work "a secco"; he did not come back later and add details onto the dry plaster.
The restorers, by assuming that the artist took a universal approach to the painting, took a universal approach to the restoration.
A decision was made that all of the shadowy layer of animal glue and "lamp black", all of the wax, and all of the overpainted areas were contamination of one sort or another: smoke deposits, earlier restoration attempts, and painted definition by later restorers in an attempt to enliven the appearance of the work.
Based on this decision, according to Arguimbau's critical reading of the restoration data that have been provided, the chemists of the restoration team decided upon a solvent that would effectively strip the ceiling down to its paint-impregnated plaster.
After treatment, only that which was painted "buon fresco" would remain.

At 13, they were viewed by classmates with envy, admiration and not a little awe.
The girls wore makeup, had boyfriends and went to parties held by older students.
The boys boasted about sneaking beers on a Saturday night and swiping condoms from the local convenience store.
“The fast-track kids didn’t turn out O.
Allen, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia.
He is the lead author of a new study, published this month in the journal Child Development, that followed these risk-taking, socially precocious cool kids for a decade.
In high school, their social status often plummeted, the study showed, and they began struggling in many ways.
It was their early rush into what Dr.
Allen calls pseudomature behavior that set them up for trouble.
Now in their early 20s, many of them have had difficulties with intimate relationships, alcohol and marijuana, and even criminal activity.
“They are doing more extreme things to try to act cool, bragging about drinking three six-packs on a Saturday night, and their peers are thinking, ‘These kids are not socially competent,’ ” Dr.
“They’re still living in their middle-school world.
” As fast-moving middle-schoolers, they were driven by a heightened longing to impress friends.
Indeed their brazen behavior did earn them a blaze of popularity.
But by high school, their peers had begun to mature, readying themselves to experiment with romance and even mild delinquency.
The cool kids’ popularity faded.
Bradford Brown, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who writes about adolescent peer relationships and was not involved in the study, said it offered a trove of data.
The finding that most surprised him, he said, was that “pseudomature” behavior was an even stronger predictor of problems with alcohol and drugs than levels of drug use in early adolescence.
Research on teenagers usually tracks them only through adolescence, Dr.
But this study, following a diverse group of 184 subjects in Charlottesville, Va.
, starting at age 13, continued into adulthood at 23.
Researchers took pains to document the rise and fall in social status, periodically interviewing the subjects as well as those who they felt knew them best, usually close friends.
About 20 percent of the group fell into the “cool kid” category at the study’s outset.
A constellation of three popularity-seeking behaviors characterized pseudomaturity, Dr.
Allen and his colleagues found.
These young teenagers sought out friends who were physically attractive; their romances were more numerous, emotionally intense and sexually exploring than those of their peers; and they dabbled in minor delinquency — skipping school, sneaking into movies, vandalism.
As they turned 23, the study found that when compared to their socially slower-moving middle-school peers, they had a 45 percent greater rate of problems resulting from alcohol and marijuana use and a 40 percent higher level of actual use of those substances.
They also had a 22 percent greater rate of adult criminal behavior, from theft to assaults.
Many attributed failed adult romantic relationships to social status: they believed that their lack of cachet was the reason their partners had broken up with them.
Those early attempts to act older than they were seemed to have left them socially stunted.
When their peers were asked how well these young adults got along with others, the former cool kids’ ratings were 24 percent lower than the average young adult.
The researchers grappled with why this cluster of behaviors set young teenagers on a downward spiral.
Allen suggested that while they were chasing popularity, they were missing a critical developmental period.
At the same time, other young teenagers were learning about soldering same-gender friendships while engaged in drama-free activities like watching a movie at home together on a Friday night, eating ice cream.
Parents should support that behavior and not fret that their young teenagers aren’t “popular,” he said.
“To be truly mature as an early adolescent means you’re able to be a good, loyal friend, supportive, hardworking and responsible,” Dr.
“But that doesn’t get a lot of airplay on Monday morning in a ninth-grade homeroom.
Brown offered another perspective about why the cool kids lost their way.
The teenagers who lead the social parade in middle school — determining everyone else’s choices in clothes, social media and even notebook colors — have a heavy burden for which they are not emotionally equipped.
“So they gravitate towards older kids,” he said.
And those older teenagers, themselves possibly former cool kids, were dubious role models, he said: “In adolescence, who is open to hanging out with someone three or four years younger.
Allen offered one typical biography from the study.
He had numerous relationships, kissed more than six girls, flung himself into minor forms of trouble, and surrounded himself with good-looking friends.
By 22, he was a high-school dropout, had many problems associated with drinking, including work absenteeism and arrests for drunken driving.
He is unemployed and still prone to minor thefts and vandalism.
Allen emphasized, pseudomaturity suggests a predilection; it is not a firm predictor.
A teenage girl from the study initially had a similar profile, with many boyfriends at an early age, attractive friends and a fondness for shoplifting.
Allen wrote in an email, “she’d earned her bachelor’s degree, had not had any more trouble with criminal behavior, used alcohol only in responsible ways and was in a good job.
Prinstein, a professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who studies adolescent social development, said that while teenagers all long to be accepted by their peers studies suggest that parents can reinforce qualities that will help them withstand the pressure to be too cool, too fast.
“Adolescents also appreciate individuality and confidence,” he said.
“Adolescents who can stick to their own values can still be considered cool, even without doing what the others are doing.
The publicly affectionate couple of Wiz Khalifa and Amber Rose are headed for a split.
TMZ reports that Rose, 30, filed for divorce this week after just 14 months of marriage.

WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen says she wants investors to be prepared for the possibility that the Fed will raise interest rates sooner than they currently project.
Volatility across stocks, bonds and currencies worldwide is close to record or multi-year lows, even after Yellen cautioned last week that the Fed's commitment to keep interest rates near zero for a "considerable time" could change if U.
economic performance continues to exceed expectations.
This absence of wide swings in trading values reflects investor complacency about the central bank's intentions — and may be too much of a good thing for its policymakers as they consider retreating from years of low-rate pledges that suppressed borrowing costs and fueled a recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression.
The danger: unexpected economic strength may speed up the timetable for tighter Fed policy, prompting a sudden surge in volatility that could jeopardize the expansion.
"The risk is that the Fed ultimately does tighten policy in the way that it's expecting and is communicating, and markets have to adjust up very quickly in a disorderly way," said Laura Rosner, a U.
economist at BNP Paribas in New York and a former New York Fed researcher.
Bank of America's MOVE Index of Treasury swings fell to 57.
43 Tuesday, close to its lowest level in data since 1988.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which measures swings in stocks, was at 14.
93, compared with a 20-year average of 20.
The JPMorgan Global FX Volatility Index was at 7.
38 percent, still near a record low of 5.
29 percent in July and down from a 20-year average of 10.
Contributing to the markets' quiescence is the Fed's decision at last week's meeting to retain assurances that the benchmark interest rate will stay low for a "considerable time" after the central bank ends a bond-purchase program intended to spur growth.
And once the rate is raised, investors are projecting a slower pace of increases than the Fed itself.
Fed officials began to rely on forward guidance to keep yields low in short-term debt maturities after cutting the federal funds rate almost to zero in December 2008.
Bond purchases, which have pushed down long-term yields, were another easing tool.
Now, with unemployment down to 6.
1 percent from a 26-year high of 10 percent in 2009, the Fed is planning to end bond purchases after its October meeting.
The Fed's estimate for full employment, one of its policy goals, is 5.
Officials, who project the fed funds rate will rise next year for the first time since 2006, are debating a change to their forward guidance.
The rate represents the cost of overnight loans in the interbank market.
While policymakers retained the language this month, Yellen used her post-meeting press conference to assert that the Fed's guidance depends on how the economy evolves.
"It is important for markets to understand that there is uncertainty and that the statement is not some sort of firm promise about a particular amount of time," Yellen said.
If economic performance trails expectations, rates will stay low for longer, she said.
If it's better than forecast, rates could rise more quickly.
Other officials have reinforced that message.
Louis Fed President James Bullard said Tuesday that the Fed may need to drop its pledge next month.
"I don't think it is state-contingent enough," said Bullard, who will have a vote on policy in 2016.
"I would like to get the committee to move to something that is more data dependent.
" Bullard is seen as a bellwether because his views have sometimes foreshadowed policy changes.
He published a paper in 2010 entitled "Seven Faces of the Peril," which called on the central bank to avert deflation by purchasing Treasury notes.
That was followed by a second round of Fed bond buying.
Yellen wants to retain flexibility and react to gyrations in economic data after a 2.
1 percent contraction in the first quarter gave way to a 4.
2 percent jump in the following three months, said former Fed Governor Randall Kroszner.
"They're not sure how the economy is going to evolve," Kroszner, who teaches economics at the University of Chicago, told Bloomberg Radio on Sept.
" Market calm is being supported in part by investor expectations that the path of interest-rate increases is likely to be shallower than the Fed itself projects.
Federal funds futures expiring in December 2015 trade at 0.
74 percent, compared with Fed officials' median projection of 1.

The divergence shows "the public might not give enough weight to how dependent the central bank's guidance is on both current and incoming data," researchers at the San Francisco Fed wrote in a Sept.
Some officials at the June Fed meeting said they viewed low volatility, as well as signs of increased risk-taking, as indications investors weren't "factoring in sufficient uncertainty about the path of the economy and monetary policy," according to minutes of the gathering.
Still, Treasuries are starting to react more to better- than-expected economic data, showing that investors are starting to get the message, according to Eric Green, head of U.
rates and economic research at TD Securities USA LLC in New York.
"The correlations are rising, and the response of the market to the data is increasing," Green said, citing research by his team showing bigger moves in securities tied to rates.
"Markets aren't as far away from what the Fed's telling them.
" Central bank officials may have created a dilemma for themselves similar to one they faced in May 2013, when then- Chairman Ben Bernanke suggested that the Fed's asset purchases could end sooner than expected, said Kathleen Bostjancic, a financial-market economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Bernanke's comments caused a more than one percentage-point jump in 10-year Treasury yields in a move dubbed the "taper tantrum.
" A repeat of that surge may erode economic growth and cause a 10 percent decline in U.
To prevent such a reaction, the Fed should start preparing markets with more hawkish language sooner rather than later.
"They're overly fearful about an adverse reaction in the bond market, so they're using this excessive guidance, and the longer they use it, the harder it gets to change it," Bostjancic said.
"Low volatility amplifies the risk greatly and the chances you have some turbulent reaction.

Baby pictures will never be the same again with the Voluson E10 Ultrasound, which offers color fetal photos more revealing than ever about what life is like in the womb.
That's not all the device will change, however, for diagnostic capability is likely to increase dramatically thanks to electronic 4D imagery that allows for biplane imaging.
Fetal health and cardiac monitoring are possible from the first trimester, creating a highlighted representation of veins and arteries.
An online article from GE shows an image of six-week-old twins, barely discernable as fetuses, at a time when some women are just finding out they may be pregnant.
As the baby grows older, vivid images are possible of the face, hands and feet, allowing parents to get to know their baby before bringing him into the world and create keepsake pictures.
It is also possible to glimpse the child smiling or sucking his thumb while in utero and a doctor remarks in the GE article that it's a moment parents don't forget.
The Book of Lamentations: a bitterly nostalgic look at a city in the process of going extinct.
From Eyewitness News: Police are alerting Queens residents and St.
John's University students about a band of bus stop bandits who appear to be getting bolder.
Officers from the 107th Precinct have stepped up their patrols with a new sense of urgency.
Detectives have released surveillance images of the three suspects.
Police say the victims were attacked moments after they stepped off the bus near Union Turnpike in Fresh Meadows.
The suspects approached the victims from behind and, in some cases, punched and kicked them before stealing cell phones, iPods, Blackberries and cash.
The bus stop bandits struck first on October 20 at 9.
They then struck two weeks later, and just this week have struck four more times.
Police say there were three muggings Wednesday night.

In 1998 the Mark Morris Dance Group purchased a derelict building on the corner of Flatbush and Lafayette Avenues in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, and hired Beyer Blinder Belle Architects and Planners to design what would become the Mark Morris Dance Center.
The company broke ground on the Dance Center in July 1999 and construction was completed in September 2001 — View Photos.
The Mark Morris Dance Center was constructed almost wholly with contributed funds, both public and private.
At the heart of the Mark Morris Dance Center are seven column-free studios with wood-sprung floors and spacious dressing rooms with lockers and showers.
Primarily used by the company and school, the seven studios which range in size from 430 square-feet to 3,600 square-feet, are available for rent to non-profit dance companies at deeply discounted rates.
The Dance Center also offers a wellness center, a performance space and expanded public spaces.
It has become a haven, a society of dancing, a community enterprise for people of all ages and abilities.
“With its translucent walls, the entire building is a tribute to light and levity, which are hallmarks of his dances as well as catalysts for his creative process.

From Crain's: The Bloomberg administration hopes to introduce legislation requiring hospitals, hotels, universities and other large-scale producers of food waste to make it into something useful rather than just send it to landfills or incinerators, sources told The Insider.
A bill could be introduced next month and passed before Mayor Michael Bloomberg and City Council Speaker Christine Quinn leave office at the end of the year.
But it would not take effect until at least 2015, and only then if food-waste processing facilities could handle the enormous quantities of food that institutions throw away.
Food waste accounts for a third of the city's more than 20,000 tons of daily refuse.
A spokesman for the mayor's office did not respond to an inquiry about the plan.
A City Council spokeswoman said the administration has told the council about the effort but has not shared a bill or enough detail for the speaker's office to be able to comment yet.
Quinn has been vocal about expanding composting in the city and has indicated a desire to pass a great deal of legislation before her term expires.
Vermont, Connecticut and Massachusetts have already adopted bans on sending commercial food waste to landfills, though it is too soon to know if they are effective because their trigger mechanisms have yet to kick in: Until sufficient processing capacity is available, businesses are off the hook.

An ambitious United States government project to strengthen medical education in sub-Saharan Africa is reporting broad progress in addressing the continent’s critical shortages of physicians and health care workers.
The four-year-old, $130 million program, the Medical Education Partnership Initiative, has given grants to 13 academic institutions in 12 countries.
In the journal Academic Medicine, more than 200 participants detail their progress in increasing student enrollment, developing research capacity and broadening curriculums.
This fall, for example, Botswana’s new school of medicine will achieve a milestone, graduating its first class — 36 doctors.
The school still struggles to retain teaching staff, but by 2015, it expects to graduate 50 a year.
In Mozambique, Eduardo Mondlane University has joined forces with the University of California, San Diego, to revamp its internal medicine program with improvements including higher salaries, curriculum changes and bedside Internet access to research databases like PubMed; as a result, the number of internist residents has more than doubled, to 75 in 2012.
After concerns were raised about the quality of health education at the University of Zimbabwe, its College of Health Sciences instituted reforms like mentored research programs for postgraduates.
By 2013 the college had nearly doubled its enrollment, to 513 medical students and postgraduates from 260 in 2010.
Three medical students from Uganda, Zimbabwe and Ethiopia reported that community-based rotations to learn rural medicine were now available to students who could otherwise not afford to pay.
More classroom supplies, including textbooks and cadavers for anatomy coursework, have been secured.
The MEPI program is funded through 2015.
Its second phase is being discussed.
The shaving industry, long dominated by giants like Gillette and Schick, now includes a wave of well-financed start-ups.
Dollar Shave Club, which just raised a $50 million round of venture capital, offers inexpensive replacement razor blades.
Harry’s offers a similar product, but with stylish handles as well.
Bevel products cater to African-American men, who are often pained by razor burn, according to the company.
The young companies are all angling for a piece of the $6.
1 billion men’s grooming market.
But they are also part of a bigger push among e-commerce companies that see opportunities in selling products as varied as mattresses and eyeglasses, where the established companies are accustomed to plump profit margins.
“There’s kind of a game going on, where there’s way too much margin,” said David Pakman, a partner at Venrock, a venture capital firm that is an investor in Dollar Shave Club.
“The big guys are overcharging you, while smaller companies like ours can give you the best products in the world for a fraction of the price.
” In 2004 Gillette reported a 60 percent gross margin before being bought by Procter & Gamble.
Gillette’s blades now often cost $10 to $40, depending on the number of razor cartridges purchased.
This is where Michael Dubin, co-founder of Dollar Shave Club, saw opportunity.
Dubin offered a subscription service online, shipping razors for $1 to $9.
The company said it expected to generate $60 million in revenue this year, triple its revenue for 2013.
One million people receive the company’s products in the mail monthly or every other month through its subscription service.
Dubin said part of the company’s success came from men being more concerned about their grooming.
The company has also found marketing success, including with a 93-second video released in 2012 that racked up more than 16 million views on YouTube.
“Gone is this stigma of being a metrosexual, sharing your grooming tips with one another,” Mr.
“Am I buying motor oil, or am I buying something to put on my face to look and smell good.
” But most of all, Dollar Shave Club and the other e-commerce start-ups are distinguishing themselves by offering a lower price.
In shaving, Bevel, which is backed by the prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, markets its old-school safety razor product set to African-American men, a demographic that the company’s founder, Tristan Walker, said had largely been ignored.
Bevel’s starter kit, which includes a safety razor, shaving cream, priming oil and other facial accouterments, starts at $29.
And Harry’s, the design-focused shaving start-up, offers its customers starter packages at $15 and $25.
Other start-ups offering less expensive consumer products include Casper, which sells mail-order mattresses to consumers online for as little as $500, nearly a tenth of the cost of high-end bed sets.
And Warby Parker, the successful online eyeglasses retailer, offers a range of trendy eyewear for far less than the cost of many frames.
The products may be disparate, but the business models are similar.
Jeffrey Raider, a co-founder of Warby Parker, even went on to start Harry’s just three years after introducing the eyewear company.
In January Harry’s raised more than $100 million in venture capital and bought its own razor factory in Eisfeld, Germany.
So far, the giants still dominate their markets.
Unilever Home & Personal Care had a 27 percent share of the men’s toiletries market last year, according to Euromonitor, a market research firm.
Procter & Gamble controls the men’s grooming market, with a 59 percent share in razors and blades.
Start-ups like Dollar Shave Club are much smaller, though Mr.
Dubin says his company ships 8.
8 percent of the razor cartridges in the United States.
To defeat the new competition, some of the giants are trying to mimic some of their smaller rivals’ tactics.
Procter & Gamble, for instance, now offers an online subscription service for ordering its Gillette razors.
“New entrants to our category stimulate more conversation about shaving, which is positive for us as the market leader,” Procter & Gamble said in a statement.
Pakman say the big companies should not feel too reassured, though.
“The incumbents are kind of trapped,” Mr.
Pakman said, partly because of marketing costs.
For one new product, the ProGlide with FlexBall razor, Procter & Gamble reportedly set aside $200 million for marketing.
“Gillette really can’t sell directly to customers because they can’t tick off the retailers.
And they can’t cut their prices by two-thirds, because their whole business model would break.
” Now, the entrepreneurs behind the start-ups sense other opportunities in adjacent markets.
Dollar Shave Club, Harry’s and others have moved into shaving cream, after-shave and men’s moisturizer products, a market that rose in 2013 to $261 million in the United States, 7 percent higher than the year before, according to Euromonitor.
And Casper, the mattress start-up, eventually plans to offer an array of sleep-focused products beyond its flagship mattresses.
As long as the margins remain high for the dominant players, analysts say there will be space for smaller competitors to chip away at the profits of those in the lead.
“Getting the price as low as you can get is really the way you can play in this market,” said Tim Barrett, a research analyst at Euromonitor.
“Anybody that can underprice Gillette and Schick can do well.
” But shaving companies both large and small have a common enemy: The resurgence of the fashionable beard, a trend that, along with a greater acceptance of facial hair in the workplace, has eaten into overall razor blade sales, at least somewhat.
“The beard trend is real,” he said.
“But I’d say that the vast majority of American men still get up, shave the hair off their face and go to work.
The 4chan page aimed at exposing nude photos of actress Emma Watson turned out to be a hoax by Rantic Marketing.
After millions visited the page "Emma You Are Next" and shared it through social media Tuesday, the page was eventually redirected to Rantic — with a clear message aimed at shutting down 4chan, the site that hosted the stolen, personal nude photos of several female celebrities.
Upon clicking the link, visitors will now see #SHUTDOWN4CHAN followed by a slideshow of various messages about closing down the site for good.
"Join us as we shutdown 4chan and prevent more private pictures from being leaked.
None of these women deserve this and together we can make a change.
" The next page shows the message: "EMMAYOUARENEXT.
COM has reached over 48 Million Visitors, 7 Million Facebook Shares/Likes & 3 Million Twitter Mentions Worldwide.
" The marketing firm also posted a message to President Obama explaining the prank.
"We have been hired by celebrity publicists to bring this disgusting issue to attention," the note read.
"The recent 4chan celebrity nude leaks in the past 2 months have been an invasion of privacy and is also clear indication that the Internet NEEDS to be censored," the statement added.
"Every Facebook like, share & Twitter mention will count as a social signature — and will be (a) step closer to shutting down www.
" The trick began after Watson's powerful U.
speech in which she introduced the "HeForShe" campaign about how the feminist movement also pertains to men.
"Men don't have the benefits of equality, either," she had said.
The faux site with a countdown and picture of Watson appearing to cry included a warning, "Never forget, the biggest to come thus far.
com was reportedly the first to confirm the site was a hoax.
com are hosted on the same server," Reddit's message read.
"They are connected to FoxWeekly, who were the first Website who broke the News about Emmayouarenext.
" Reddit's message added: "Foxweekly used to be a youtube spammer group named Swenzy (later 'SocialVevo') and emmayouarenext.
com resembles one of their previous schemes, a website with a countdown to a supposed announcement about the character Brian from 'Family Guy.
'" However, Rantic, not Foxweekly, has taken full responsibility for the hoax.
The marketing firm, which lists Brad Cockingham as founder and CEO, has yet to respond to the Daily News' request for comment.
In fact, when attempting to reach the company Wednesday through the website contact, an error message appeared immediately after clicking "send.
" The site notes: "Contact form is down due to high mail volume.
" After sending an email to inquiries@rantic.
com, an "undeliverable" message was received.
Cockingham appears to have no personal Twitter account and his supposed Facebook page lists him as marketing director for Rockstar North as well as Rantic.
"We fully support Emma and her campaign #heforshe," Rantic's Twitter page posted Wednesday.
"Hopefully 4chan users will convert to feminism right before it goes down.
" Another tweet on the marketing firm's page read: "4chan is messing with the wrong one, ladies have been suffering, Kids are being exposed to the utterly disturbing content, 4chan IS KILL.
" Finally the firm tweeted, "Shut down 4chan prevent suicides and violence towards women, Support the cause, End the problem.
DANVERS — It could be as soon as Friday morning when the names of three finalists for town manager are released by the screening committee to ….
I had high hopes for this book but my expectations were not met.
The authors are clearly eager to bear the Freakonomics mantle (they say as much in several places), but unfortunately they do not exhibit anything resembling the flair of Levitt and Dubner.
Their cute comparison of quarterbacks and mutual funds just sounds like a cheap imitation of the comparison between teachers and sumo wrestlers (which, honestly, wasn't all that clever anyway).
Much of the other writing also seems to imitate the conversational style of Bill James, but without as much wit.
Overall the writing comes off as alternately condescending and self-congratulatory, and sometimes both.
Style aside, the book contains a number of substantive weaknesses.
For example, the chapter on the effects of labor shortages on fan attendance shows clear signs of bias.
The authors favorably cite plenty of evidence that supports their hypothesis; and when confronted with evidence to the contrary, they suddenly decide to pick it apart and explain it away.
Sorry guys, it doesn't work that way.
This clear example of "disconfirmation bias" causes the chapter to lose all credibility.
It wouldn't hold up in a peer-reviwed journal.
Further, although the authors claim to be "taking measure of the many myths in modern sport" (the subtitle of the book), they actually devote a lot of effort to knocking down strawmen.
Is there anyone alive who really thinks that "the best players in basketball score the most" or that "quarterbacks should be credited with wins and losses".
No one with more than a passing knowledge of sports actually believe these things, but the authors act awfully smug after debunking these nonexistent "myths.
" Yes, we're all aware that offense is at most half of football, and that the passing attack is only about half of that.
Luckily no one attributes wins to quarterbacks, except maybe to point out that a team can win with a mediocre QB (e.
, pointing out Trent Dilfer's career winning percentage) -- which is a different issue altogether.
The book also spends a lot of time trying to analyze basketball using methods that are much better suited to baseball.
Don't get me wrong, I admire their effort to subject basketball to some analytical rigor.
But baseball is largely an amalgam of statistics and can be studied as such.
There are too many events in basketball that clearly affect the game but are not quantified (a pick, a shot that is altered but not blocked, a team deciding not to drive against a particular player, a player drawing a double team and getting a teammate open, the second-to-last pass of a possession).
One might conclude, based on the demonstrated strong correlation between wins and the conventional statistics employed in this book, that these events are all relatively unimportant.
But this argument ultimately fails because the purpose of the analysis is to measure the contributions of individual players.
A team might score two points but the model does not adequately break down individual contributions beyond who scores the points and, if applicable, who gets the assist.
Similarly, most of what happens on defense isn't recorded, and the model only takes into account steals and blocked shots.
The authors sweep these weaknesses under the rug and proceed to devote dozens of pages to comparing players based on their new, supposedly superior, measures of individual performance.
Further, I was also struck how a team of economists could write about the value of basketball players without paying attention to the supply curve.
They do adjust some of their stats for league-average at the position, but not on a category-by-category basis.
In the final chapter, where they purport to show that scorers are paid too much, they fail to examine the issue of scarcity.
My wild guess is that the data would support their conclusion, but I was struck by the absence of real analysis here.
Of course, no book on sports statistics and/or economics is complete without the obligatory nod to the genius of Billy Beane and the claim that salary disparities do not lead to competitive imbalance.
This version of the story is no more convincing than any of the others.
They happily point to the 2003 Marlins as an example of a low-payroll team winning against the odds, but somehow ignore the fact that a number of those players (Derrek Lee, A.
Burnett, Josh Beckett, Ivan Rodriguez, Alex Gonzalez, Mike Lowell) are now earning big salaries in big markets while the Marlins are under.
Sure, a team can win with young players who haven't yet become eligible for free agency or arbitration, but is that any way to build a franchise for long-term success.
Where is the analysis of that rather obvious question.
And where is the point, made quite clear in Moneyball, that no inefficient market can last forever.
What happens when the next Billy Beane is hired to run the Yankees.
I will grant that the book is thought-provoking.
But ultimately there are many other books on sports statistics and economics that are much more readable and well-argued than this.
Everybody knows that the colleges care about more than GPAs and standardized testing.
They look at curriculum strength, essays, teacher recs and, in particular, extracurriculars.
It is no secret that the admissions committees are very concerned about what you do with your spare time -- be it volunteering with lepers in India or interning as a trapeze artist with Cirque du Soleil.
And it is equally important that you do not begin a brand new extracurricular activity during your junior year.
The admissions committees will not be impressed with your story unless you have demonstrated a lifelong passion for your extracurricular of choice.
This makes it a challenge to choose a summer activity for the summer between junior and senior year of high school.
Theoretically, it is best to be chosen for a prestigious, competitive program related to your passion, a program that ideally you can position as an award or scholarship on your application.
Unfortunately, there are only seven of these programs, and four are for New Jersey residents only.
And, if you're anything like most kids, you missed the deadlines, or your robotic skills are so rusty that you probably wouldn't have qualified anyway.
That means you will be faced with a mind-boggling choice between the following: --A CHALLENGING SUMMER COURSE AT AN IVY.
Schools like Brown, Columbia and Cornell offer fascinating classes for pre-college students -- courses in Great Books, Genomes or Globalization.
Unfortunately, these programs cost $5,000-$8,000, and although the colleges like keeping their dorms filled, they are not particularly impressed when they see these classes on your resume.
They might assume you settled for Genome Studies because you couldn't get into a more prestigious program.
-- A LIFE-CHANGING TRIP TO A WAR-RIDDEN, DEVELOPING COUNTRY.
These excursions, which often involve shelling out $8,200 to shadow a bunion surgeon in Mongolia or train villagers in Guam to grow sustainable kale hydroponically, take high school students out of their comfort zones.
The participants live with local families in mud huts and come back with a new appreciation for the lavish after-parties they attend at home.
But sadly, the colleges don't like to hear about these adventures.
They want you to wait until you're IN college to go on expeditions to the rainforest, because then their own institutions will benefit from the research results.
-- AN OUTWARD BOUND EXPERIENCE BACKPACKING BLINDFOLDED IN WEST VIRGINIA.
Again, the colleges once respected students who spent their summers eating bark.
But now they look at these programs, some with price tags of $3,625, as magnets for troubled teens.
-- AN INTERNSHIP ON YOUR UNCLE BRAD'S NEW PILOT FOR FOX.
Stinks of privilege, especially if the show is picked up.
That leaves just one desirable summer activity: -- A JOB AT JAMBA JUICE.
This, my friends, is what the colleges want to see.
All the better if you don't actually get to operate the fresh press and you spend eight full hours a day peeling carrots and mopping up.
But landing one of these coveted assignments is not as easy as it sounds.
I'm sorry to report that most summer Jamba Juice positions have already gone to recent cum laude Entrepreneurial Studies graduates.
That's where the Summer Conundrum Counselors come in: For a mere $6,500, less than it will cost to go to Ghana or Cornell, these essential members of the college process support team will personally arrange an UNPAID INTERNSHIP at a Jamba Juice for high school students.
Although there is no compensation, they will make sure that you encounter severe traffic, rude customers and rancid protein powder -- a plethora of excellent essay material.
and all in all, the kind of experience that jumps off the page.
Apply soon -- opportunities are limited.
You don't want to spend your summer doing something questionable like studying International Relations at Columbia.

Re: CALLER STS THAT 15 TO 20 PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN A ONE FAMILYHOUSE.
The status of James Joyce as a writer never could be determined in his lifetime.
In the opinion of some critics, notably Edmund Wilson, he deserved to rank with the great innovators of literature as one whose influence upon other writers of his time was incalculable.
On the other hand, there were critics like Max Eastman who gave him a place with Gertrude Stein and T.
Eliot among the "Unintelligibles" and there was Professor Irving Babbitt of Harvard who dismissed his most widely read novel, "Ulysses," as one which only could have been written "in an advanced stage of psychic disintegration.
" Originally published in 1922, "Ulysses" was not legally available in the United States until eleven years later, when United States Judge John Monro Woolsey handed down his famous decision to the effect that the book was not obscene.
Hitherto the book had been smuggled in and sold at high prices by "bookleggers" and a violent critical battle had raged around it.
"'Ulysses' is not an easy book to read or understand," Judge Woolsey wrote.
"But there has been much written about it, and in order properly to approach the consideration of it it is advisable to read a number of other books which have now become its satellites.
The study of "Ulysses" is therefore a heavy task.
"The reputation of 'Ulysses' in the literary world, however, warranted my taking such time as was necessary to enable me to satisfy myself as to the intent with which the book was written, for, of course, in any case where a book is claimed to be obscene it must first be determined whether the intent with which it was written was what is called, according to the usual phrase, pornographic, that is, written for the purpose of exploiting obscenity.

Back at Flushing Meadows again, the 2013 hotbed of activity.
Now we're taking a look at the USTA.
Here's what's there now, courtesy of Save FMCP: and here's their proposal: They want to build not one, but two stadiums - demolish and replace the one on the upper right and add one on the bottom left, killing a boatload of trees in the process.
All because they claim that they can't be competitive with other countries.
There haven't been any advances in the sport that require new facilities.
I don't see how this makes them more competitive or why their alleged predicament should be a problem that Queens residents need to help them solve.
The US Open isn't going anywhere.
This is just an attempt to get more free land at taxpayer expense.

GLENEAGLES, Scotland — As the top-ranked player and lodestar of the European team, Rory McIlroy is right back where he was two years ago at the last Ryder Cup, won by the Europeans with a Sunday singles session for the ages.
McIlroy was instrumental in the upset of the Americans, but not before giving his squad of elders a few more gray hairs.
At the start of the 2012 event, the talk was that McIlroy was in the American team’s cross hairs.
And yet, as the final day’s pivotal singles matches were set to begin at Medinah Country Club outside Chicago, McIlroy was in nobody’s sights.
Roughly 30 minutes before McIlroy was due to tee off in the third match of the day, he was missing.
His fellow Ulsterman Graeme McDowell, who was playing in the seventh match, was already at the course.
This is problematic,’ ” McDowell said.
“It was quite an amazing thing, really.
” José María Olazábal, Europe’s frazzled captain, could laugh recently while recounting the chaotic scene.
But he was not smiling that Sunday morning when he stood on Medinah’s first tee, waiting for Luke Donald to tee off against Bubba Watson, and heard a voice in his headset say, “Ollie, we have a problem.
” At the hotel shared by both teams about 11 miles away, the local police from the Village of Lombard had canvassed the volunteers at the hotel’s transportation desk and the security on each floor, and no one recalled seeing McIlroy leave.
Patrick Rollins, then Lombard’s deputy chief, said, “I started panicking.
” He consulted with a lieutenant, Roy Newton, who decided to accompany a European Tour representative to McIlroy’s room for a welfare check.
Rollins was afraid of what they might find.
In the previous 18 months, the police force, in tandem with the Ryder Cup organizers, had formed a contingency plan for every emergency, it seemed, except the disappearance or demise of a player.
“Absolutely, I was concerned,” Rollins said Monday by phone from Sugar Grove, Ill.
, where he is the chief of police.
“I was thinking about recent cases of people in the news who were found in their hotel rooms injured or worse.
” Newton rapped on the door, and McIlroy, who had been talking to his then-girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki, was startled by the intrusion.
He had misread the schedule, confusing Eastern time for Central time.
He had less than a half-hour to make the roughly 20-minute commute, so it was McIlroy’s turn to panic.
If he could not catch up with his opponent, Keegan Bradley, within five minutes of their tee time, he would lose not just the first hole but the match, according to the agreement signed by the captains before the event.
Bradley, who was playing in his first Ryder Cup, had arrived at the course early so he could whip the partisan crowd at the first tee into a patriotic froth.
As the minutes ticked by and there was no sign of McIlroy, Bradley grew anxious.
“It was a little distracting,” he said, “because everyone was talking about it, coming up to me.
” He added, “It was kind of helter-skelter.
” Bradley said he came up with a contingency plan that he ran past an official.
“There’s no way I was going to let him forfeit the match by not showing up,” he said.
“We were going to bump our time back or move back when he showed up.
” But the rules did not allow rearranging starting times in the name of sportsmanship, which McIlroy knew even if Bradley did not.
“I was panicking, I really was,” McIlroy said, adding: “Because it wasn’t just me that was going to have the disappointment of showing up late, it was 11 other guys on the team and the captain and the vice captains.
So it was a pretty scary moment.
” Rushing to the rescue was Rollins.
His unmarked Crown Victoria, parked in front of the hotel, was warmed up because he had begun his morning in a convoy to the airport for former President George H.
Bush and his wife, Barbara, who had attended Saturday’s matches.
McIlroy jumped into the passenger seat, bearing in each hand a cellphone pinging with text and email messages from people wanting to know his whereabouts.
“The thing that I was worried about was letting the team down,” McIlroy said.
“We were already in a bad position.
It was 10-6, and the last thing they needed was me to have to forfeit a game because I was late.
” Rollins radioed officers along the route with the cryptic message “I’m bringing a V.
” Laughing at the recollection, he said, “Everyone assumed it was one of the former presidents.
” He took his eyes off the road only a few times.
The first was to reassure McIlroy he would get him to the course on time.
The second was after he was forced to brake quickly.
Rollins said he turned to McIlroy and asked, “Do you get car sick or motion sickness.
” When McIlroy said he did not, Rollins said he “picked up the pace.
” They made excellent time, but as they approached the Lake Street exit ramp, the traffic was backed up and there was no shoulder for Rollins to maneuver around the line of cars.
“I looked at Rory, and that was the only point where I had doubts if we were going to make it,” said Rollins, who flashed his lights and blared the siren permanently mounted in the grille of his car to get the attention of officers directing traffic on the ramp.
They cleared a path, and after Rollins made the turn, McIlroy directed him to the best entrance to the course.
He arrived with 11 minutes to spare.
“As soon as I came to an abrupt halt, his door opened and he had one foot on the ground and he darted out,” Rollins said.
I would have been doing the same thing.
” McIlroy slipped on his golf shoes, hit a few practice putts while eating an energy bar and then spoke to a relieved Olazábal.
McIlroy made his way to the first tee, where the fans Bradley had helped rile up greeted him with a “Central time” chant.
McIlroy took the lead on the fourth hole and held on for a 2-and-1 victory to help pace the Europeans’ come-from-behind upset.
“Once I got there and knew I was going to make it, I was just saying, ‘Let’s try and keep it together for the first six holes, like keep it to all-square or even just 1-down or something,’ ” McIlroy said.
He added: “Ended up I was 2 up after six, and then I was like, ‘Well, this is actually O.
’ And it ended up that it was the best golf I played of the whole week.
” No one is worried about McIlroy, or any other golfer, not making it to Gleneagles on time.
The teams are staying at the resort hotel on the grounds.
“The good thing about this week is that, you know, if somebody is late, they can roll out of bed to the first tee within five minutes,” the European captain, Paul McGinley, said Monday with a laugh.
McGinley described McIlroy’s madcap Sunday as “a big learning curve for everybody” and said, “We certainly have procedures in place in order for that not to happen.
” McGinley was sharing the stage with his American counterpart, Tom Watson, who interjected, “You’re going to knock on their doors at 5 o’clock in the morning.
Developer Townscape Partners, which recently announced plans to replace a stripmall and mid-century bank building at Sunset and Crescent Heights with 249 apartments and 110,000 square feet of commercial space, had their first meet and greet with the neighbors and it went about as well as you'd expect.
Wehoville was on the scene and reports that "residents aired a wide range of grievances with the project, including concerns over parking, rooftop sound, traffic, demolition of the Chase Bank building, which some see as having historical qualities, safety, the residential way of life being altered along Havenhurst Drive.
, and, above all, the 16-story height of the apartment building along Havenhurst.
" On the last point, residents perhaps can take comfort from City Councilmember Tom LaBonge (who reps the area), who also thinks the buildings are "a little to high.
" However, they'll get no help from the zoning code: there are no height restrictions for the area and Townscape says that if they lower the height the project will lose some of its open space.
And you'll never guess which other objection was raised by unhappy neighbors.
At least one attendee raised the spector of the seismically-challenged Millennium Hollywood (quite the trendsetter, that one): "Developers say concerns over the fault are overblown, while residents, who are also opposed to the project's scale, say it's a major overlooked problem.
For the sake of ending things on a light note, check out this tongue-in-cheek ditty from Jamaican mento band The Jolly Boys.
The lyrics pose the question, "If your mother and your wife were drowning, I want to know which one you would be saving.
" The answer, of course, is your mother, because you can "always get another wife, [and] never get another mother in my life.
When it Comes to Leveling the Playing Field for Women Writers, VIDA Reminds us, Women are Not Alone With the pervasiveness of gender inequality in nearly every arena, it's heartening to know that there are passionate individuals and organizations out there working hard to affect change.
Nonprofit groups like VIDA: Women in Literary Arts are leading the charge, effectively "calling out" those in positions of power to give opportunities to talented women.
This month, Pen and Brush, a nonprofit that showcases work by female artists and writers, is celebrating its 120th anniversary by breaking with its past.
The organization, which tries to further women’s careers by introducing their work to the public, gallery owners and curators, is changing its selection process as well as how and where the work is shown.
From The Boardroom to the Gallery, Women Shut Out Nicholas D.
Kristof wrote in his recent New York Times "Twitter, Women and Power", that, on the eve of Twitter's IPO, it has become abundantly clear that the organization's board suffers from a huge gender imbalance.
Not a single woman sits on Twitter's board -- an all too familiar trend, as Kristof points out, as women comprise only 18 percent of board seats among Fortune 500 companies.
Towards Gender Parity: Quality and Fairness in the Art Market In January of this year, the Rema Hort Mann Foundation staged a lively panel discussion on the enduring disenfranchisement of women in the art market, moderated by the foundation’s director, Quang Bao.
In response to Bao’s essay accompanying the podcast of the panel here at artcritical, Janice Sands offers her perspective on gender parity as director of Pen and Brush, the 119-year old nonprofit women’s art organization.

Newkirk Plaza is an express station on the BMT Brighton Line of the New York City Subway in Flatbush, Brooklyn, served by the Q train at all times and the B train on weekdays.
It is located on an open-cut at the center of the pedestrian-only Newkirk Plaza shopping mall, which bounded by Newkirk Avenue on the north, Foster Avenue on the south, Marlborough Road to the west, and East 16th Street to the east.
This open-cut station has four tracks and two island platforms.
Q trains normally use the outer local tracks while B trains stop at the inner express tracks.
The Manhattan-bound local track is completely underneath the east side of the mall while the Coney Island-bound one is underneath the west side of the mall except for a section at the north end.
The express tracks are in open view except in the center (where the station's only entrance is) and at either ends (where the Newkirk and Foster Avenues overpasses are).
The station's only entrance is a station house at the center of the plaza.
It has a token booth, turnstile bank, and a staircase leading to a short landing above both platforms that separate into two staircases facing the opposite directions going down to the platforms themselves.
The station house was renovated in 1988, which included installation of white tiles and a stained-glass artwork titled Transit Skylight by David Wilson.
The station and above-ground shopping plaza underwent reconstruction from 2009 to 2011.
This included installation of yellow warning strips on the platform edges and repainting of the columns from red to green.
The station opened around 1900 as a two-track surface station named South Midwood, a reference to its location at the southern end of the former Town of Flatbush, which was also historically known as Midwood.
Currently, Midwood is considered to be the area south of where the station now stands, so it would now more correctly be described as being in South Flatbush or North Midwood.
When on the surface, the station was a division point at which short turned elevated trains of the Fulton Street El terminated.
After grade crossings were eliminated in 1908 the station became a through stop for all services; at this time it was given the name Newkirk Avenue.
The station was renamed Newkirk Plaza in August 2011.
On the eastern side of the station entrance building there is a plaque which reads "The Depression and Elevation of this railroad to abolish grade crossings was authorized by the Legislature May 9th, 1903.
A joint undertaking between the City Of New York and the Brooklyn Heights R.
under the direction of the Brooklyn Grade Crossing Commission.
Work commenced August 1st 1904 - Completed July 1st 1908".
This station appeared in the Futurama episode "The Luck of the Fryrish" and was portrayed as being in Fry's old neighborhood of Ditmas Park, considering his old home is a detached albeit run-down Victorian house.
It also appeared in the films Next Stop, Greenwich Village[2] and Man Push Cart.
One of America’s most patriotic beers has defected.
A Russian company has purchased Pabst Blue Ribbon, an iconic brew that’s been in production in the U.
New York aficionados of the beer — traditionally sold with a red-white-and-blue label — said “nyet” to the news when it was announced Friday.
“I don’t think I will ever f-----g drink another Pabst Blue Ribbon in my entire life,” said construction worker Danny Kelly, 34.
“That is an American company, it is an American beer for God knows how many years and now it’s going over to Russia.
I will boycott it,” he said from inside The Patriot, a watering hole on Chambers St.
Financier Jack Thomas, one of several Wall St.
types who mixed with blue collar workers at a happy hour on Friday, saw a way to make a buck off the unpopular deal.
“My girlfriend’s from Buffalo, and all they drink there is Pabst,” said Thomas, 36.
“If they hear that, they’re going to go to Labatt.
I would buy Labatt stock right now.
” Clay Sherman, 37, an engineer, said he was against the sale on principle.
“Are they still going to keep all the manufacturing here.
” he asked, out of concern for the potential for U.
It’s a pretty iconic American beer, so I hope it does stay here,” he said.
Oasis, the Russian company that purchased the brand, which is also very popular among the hipster set, has said it will keep Pabst’s operations in America.
The beer company, originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
, now has its headquarters in Los Angeles.
The terms of the sale were not disclosed, but Oasis picked up several well-known beer brands in addition to Pabst.
The brewing company also produces Lone Star, Schlitz and Old Milwaukee.
The company recently reintroduced Ballantine Pale Ale, an old recipe first brewed in 1878 in New Jersey.
“Pabst Blue Ribbon is the quintessential American brand — it represents individualism, egalitarianism, and freedom of expression — all the things that make this country great,” Eugene Kashper, the chair of Oasis Beverages, and now the CEO of Pabst, said in a statement.

The family of a Georgia mother killed last week says she died saving her infant daughter from her drunk, violent boyfriend.
Jessica Arrendale died after being shot in the head on September 14 at her home in Smyrna, according to the Associated Press.
Police were called to the house in the early morning hours, but waited 14 hours to enter the house, worried that their presence would incite more violence, according to WSB.
However, officials believe that both Arrendale, 37, and her boyfriend, 30-year-old Antoine Davis, were dead before police even arrived.
Arrendale’s lifeless body was found slumped over a toilet, police said.
Davis was found in the couple’s baby’s bedroom, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
Police believe Davis became drunk and belligerent, beating Arrendale with a baseball bat and shooting her in the head before killing himself.
The couple's 6-month-old daughter was found in the toilet, alive, according to Fox 8.
Investigators believe Arrendale was holding the girl when she was shot in the head, and managed to turn in such a way that dropped the baby into the toilet and shielded the girl with her body.
Arrendale’s mother, Teresa Ionniello, told WSB that she believes Davis wanted to kill both Arrendale and the baby, but was unable to see the baby in the toilet, covered by the woman’s body.
“She was the hero,” Ionniello said, “because her last breath was saving the child.
” Ionniello also told WSB that Davis had abused Arrendale many times previously.
The baby suffered a traumatic head injury, possibly from being hit with the baseball bat Davis used to beat Arrendale.
Arrendale’s friend, Leslie Tidwell Jordan, set up a GoFundMe page for the care for the baby, as well as for Arrendale’s older daughter, who is 15.
Jordan states on the page that Jessica was the “sole provider for her household.
” As of Tuesday morning, the account had raised over $33,000.
This story has been updated to indicate that Arrendale is 37, according to her death notice in The Marietta Daily.
This article previously followed several outlets in reporting her age as 33.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated that Davis was Arrendale's husband.

In a report released last week, state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli said the Metropolitan Transit Authority listed the reactivation of the Rockaway Beach LIRR is not only feasible, but a good investment for the financially-shaky agency The document alleged that the MTA has not restored the entire transit system to a state of good repair because it has not received all the funding it has sought and because cost overruns on large capital projects siphoned off resources that could have been used to modernize the system.
In it, DiNapoli says restoring the route would cut down on costs of transporting residents in South Queens and the Rockaways and spur development in the area.
“The MTA has stated that given the fiscal constraints of the current economy, it will need to respond with new strategies to boost capacity and accessibility, and which are more strategic in scale and location and are accomplished within customers’ commuting lifetimes,” the state comptroller said in the report.
“Potential new strategies include rebuilding constrained subway junctions and terminals, expanding station stairways and platforms, and converting available rights-of-way.
The MTA cites the former LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch as an example of this approach.
Restoring service on the Rockaway Beach Branch would be a less costly way to speed commutes between South Queens and Manhattan, improve travel within the borough, and promote economic growth.
” The rail line, which was abandoned in 1962, would connect the Rockaways to the LIRR Main Line into Penn Station at Rego Park.
Longtime residents of South Queens and the Rockaways say before it stopped running, commute times to Penn Station were less than 20 minutes from Howard Beach and 40 minutes from Rockaway Park.
A trip on the A train to 34th Street-Penn Station could take three times as long.
Assemblyman Phil Goldfeder (D-Rockaway Park), a staunch supporter of reactivating the line, saw the report as a positive step toward the reality of restarting train service.
“This report is a huge step forward and I will continue to work closely with state Comptroller DiNapoli, my colleagues and the MTA until the Rockaway Beach Rail Line becomes a reality,” Goldfeder said.
“I applaud State Comptroller DiNapoli for his tireless efforts to assist our Queens families and improve transit services.
” Phil McManus, a Rockaway resident and founder of the Queens Public Transit Committee, a group that has been advocating reactivation of the rail line, was also pleased with the report and urged construction of the line.
“Our city, state and federal governments need to invest in transportation for all the people,” he said.
“Imagine the social, economic, recreational and environmental opportunities if we completely restored the Rockaway Beach Rail Line.
” Supporters say the rail line would also decrease traffic on Woodhaven Boulevard by providing residents not only in the Rockaways, but also along the boulevard’s corridor a quicker route to Northern Queens and Manhattan.
The Queens College Office of Community Studies is conducting a feasibility study on the potential community impacts of various proposed redevelopment options for the abandoned Rockaway Beach Branch line, including a competing plan to construct a linear park similar to Manhattan’s High Line along the length of the former rail line between Ozone Park and Rego Park.
Called the QueensWay, the park plan is being spearheaded by The Trust for Public Land, a national urban parks advocacy and planning organization.
The QueensWay plan is under evaluation and the state comptroller has recognized it.
“The Friends of the QueensWay and its thousands of supporters living and working in Central and southern Queens continue to believe that the QueensWay is the best and only way to maximize the quality of life and economic development benefits that will be realized when this property is adaptively reused for the community,” said Travis Terry, a member of the Friends of the QueensWay steering committee.
“Studies by the MTA and Port Authority have conclusively shown that rail reactivation – estimated at a cost of over $7 billion – is not a feasible option and local elected officials have strongly opposed rail.
In the Fall, we look forward to announcing the results of our study which will detail how conversion of this over 50-year abandoned property into a new public park and community amenity will have a tremendous positive impact on the people living, working and visiting the borough of Queens.
” Last December, DiNapoli issued a report on the economy recovery in Queens in which he listed the QueensWay as an example of “major economic development” that could affect the borough in the near future, alongside JetBlue’s new Long Island City headquarters, Willets Point, Flushing Commons and the Cornell Tech school planned for Roosevelt Island.
About 12% of women develop breast cancer in their lifetime.
Each year in the United States, about 192,000 women are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and about 68,000 women are diagnosed with pre-invasive breast cancer.
(Although breast cancer in men is rare, about 2,000 American men are diagnosed each year with invasive breast cancer.
) About 40,000 American women die from breast cancer each year.
Breast cancer death rates have declined significantly since the 1990s, especially for women younger than age 50.
The earlier breast cancer is diagnosed, the earlier the opportunity for treatment.
In the United States, there are currently more than 2.
5 million breast cancer survivors.
Most cases of breast cancer occur in women older than age 60.
According to the American Cancer Society, about 1 in 8 cases of invasive breast cancer are found in women younger than age 45, while 2 in 3 cases of invasive breast cancer occur in women age 55 and older.
Breast cancer is slightly more common among white woman than African-American, Asian, Latina, or Native American women.
However, African-American women tend to have more aggressive types of breast cancer tumors and are more likely to die from breast cancer than women of other races.
It is unclear whether this is mainly due to biologic or socioeconomic reasons.
Social and economic factors make it less likely that African-American women will be screened, so they are more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage.
They are also less likely to have access to effective treatments.
Breast cancer is also more prevalent among Jewish women of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) descent (see Genetic Factors, below).
Women who have a family history of breast cancer are at increased risk for developing breast cancer themselves.
Having a first-degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter) who has been diagnosed with breast cancer doubles the risk for developing breast cancer.
Women who have had ovarian cancer are at increased risk for developing breast cancer.
And, a personal history of breast cancer increases the risk of developing a new cancer in the same or other breast.
About 5 - 10% of breast cancer cases are due to inherited genetic mutations.
Inherited mutations in genes known as BRCA1 or BRCA2 are responsible for most cases of hereditary breast cancers, ovarian cancers, or both in families with a history of these cancers.
BRCA gene mutations are present in only about 0.
However, certain ethnic groups -- such as Jewish women of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) descent -- have a higher prevalence (2.
BRCA gene mutations are also seen in some African-American and Hispanic women.
Screening Guidelines for BRCA Genes.
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that women at high risk should be tested for BRCA genes, but does not recommend routine genetic counseling or testing in low-risk women (no family history of BRCA 1 or 2 genetic mutations).
Risk assessment is based on a woman’s family history of breast and ovarian cancer (on both the maternal and paternal sides).
In general, a woman is considered at high risk for BRCA genes if she has a first-degree relative (mother, daughter, or sister) or several second-degree relatives (grandmother, aunt) diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer.
Women who do not have a family history of breast cancer have a low probability of inheriting BRCA genes and do not need to be tested.
The relevance of the inherited BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations to survival is controversial.
Some studies have suggested that these mutations are linked to less lethal breast cancer.
Others suggest that they do not change prognosis or may worsen it.
Women with these genetic mutations do have a greater risk for a new cancer to develop.
Patients with BRCA1 mutations tend to develop tumors that are hormone receptor negative, which can behave more aggressively.
Other genes associated with increased hereditary breast cancer risk include p53, CHEK2, ATM, and PTEN.
Because growth of breast tissue is highly sensitive to estrogens, the more estrogen a woman is exposed to over her lifetime, the higher her risk for breast cancer.
Early age at menarche (first menstrual period) or later age at menopause may slightly increase a woman’s risk for breast cancer.
Women who have never had children or who had their first child after age 30 may have a slightly increased breast cancer risk.
Having children at an early age, and having multiple pregnancies, reduces breast cancer risk.
Scientific evidence shows there is no association between abortion and increased breast cancer risk.
Studies have been mixed on whether breast-feeding decreases breast cancer risk.
Breast-feeding reduces a woman's total number of menstrual cycles, and thereby estrogen exposure, which may account for its possible protective effects.
Some studies suggest that the longer a woman breast-feeds, the lower her risk, and that breast-feeding may be most protective for women with a family history of breast cancer.
Although studies have been conflicting about whether estrogen in oral contraceptives increase the chances for breast cancer, the most recent research indicates that current or former oral contraceptive use does not significantly increase breast cancer risk.
Women who have used oral contraceptives may have slightly more risk for breast cancer than women who have never used them, but this risk declines once a woman stops using birth control pills.
Many studies have reported a higher risk for breast cancer in postmenopausal women who take combination hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which contains both estrogen and progesterone.
Combination HRT is used by women who have a uterus, because estrogen alone can increase the risk of uterine cancer.
Estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy is prescribed for women who have had a hysterectomy.
According to the most recent studies, long-term use (about 5 years or more) of combination HRT increases the risk of developing and dying from breast cancer.
This risk then decreases within 5 years of stopping combination HRT.
The North American Menopause Society recommends that women who are at risk for breast cancer should avoid hormone therapy and try other options to manage menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes.
Most doctors recommend that women use HRT only for short-term relief of menopausal symptoms.
In recent years, rates of breast cancer have decreased as fewer women have opted for HRT.
Women who take HRT should be aware that they need regular mammogram screenings, because HRT increases breast cancer density, making mammograms more difficult to read.
Infertility and Infertility Treatments.
Despite some concerns that infertility treatments using the drug clomiphene may increase the risk for breast cancer, most studies do not show an association.
Some studies indicate that ovulation induction with clomiphene may actually decrease breast cancer risk.
(Clomphine is related to tamoxifen, a drug that is used for breast cancer prevention in high-risk women.
) Certain breast conditions may increase the risk for breast cancer: Some common benign breast abnormalities that pose very little or no risks for breast cancer include: The following physical characteristics have been associated with increased risk: Exposure to Estrogen-like Industrial Chemicals.
Chemicals with estrogen-like effects, called xenoestrogens, have been under suspicion for years.
There has been particular concern with pesticides containing organochlorines (DDT and its metabolites, such as dieldrin) and pyrethroids (permethrin), but at this time evidence of any causal association is very weak.
Exposure to Diethylstilbestrol.
Women who took diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriage have a slightly increased risk for breast cancer.
There may also be a slightly increased risk for their daughters (commonly called "DES daughters"), who were exposed to the drug when their mothers took it during pregnancy.
Heavy exposure to radiation is a significant risk factor for breast cancer.
Girls who receive high-dose radiation therapy for cancer face an increased risk for breast cancer in adulthood.
Low-dose radiation exposure before age 20 may increase the risk for women with BRCA genetic mutations.
Antiperspirants or use of deodorants after shaving have not been linked with any higher risk for breast cancer.
There is also no evidence that bras increase breast risk.
Abortion does not increase risk.
The United States stock market looks very expensive right now.
The CAPE ratio, a stock-price measure I helped develop — is hovering at a worrisome level.
I wrote with some concern about the high ratio in this space a little over a year ago, when it stood at around 23, far above its 20th-century average of 15.
(CAPE stands for cyclically adjusted price-earnings.
) Now it is above 25, a level that has been surpassed since 1881 in only three previous periods: the years clustered around 1929, 1999 and 2007.
Major market drops followed those peaks.
The CAPE was never intended to indicate exactly when to buy and to sell.
The market could remain at these valuations for years.
But we should recognize that we are in an unusual period, and that it’s time to ask some serious questions about it.
Campbell, now at Harvard, and I created the ratio more than 25 years ago.
It works like this: Using inflation-adjusted figures, we divide stock prices by corporate earnings averaged over the preceding 10 years.
Our ratio differs from a conventional price-to-earnings ratio in that it uses 10 years, rather than one year, in the denominator.
It does so to help minimize effects of business-cycle fluctuations, and it’s helpful in comparing valuations over long horizons.
In the last century, the CAPE has fluctuated greatly, yet it has consistently reverted to its historical mean — sometimes taking a while to do so.
Periods of high valuation have tended to be followed eventually by stock-price declines.
Still, the ratio has been a very imprecise timing indicator: It’s been relatively high — above 20 — for almost all the last 20 years, with the exception of 20 months, mostly in the recession of 2007-9, when prices tumbled and it fell as low as 13.
In other words, the ratio is saying the stock market has been relatively expensive for years.
And that raises a question: Are there legitimate factors behind high stock prices that might keep them elevated for decades more.
Such a question has been addressed before.
In 1930, just after the 1929 crash, Prof.
Irving Fisher of Yale published “The Stock Market Crash — and After.
” The book explained why there were “sound reasons” for the high valuations of 1929.
He couldn’t have been more wrong.
To understand valuations, I have conducted questionnaire surveys of individual and institutional investors since 1989, recently under the auspices of the Yale School of Management.
One question, asking if stocks are overvalued, undervalued or valued about right, is used to create a valuation confidence index.
When the CAPE ratio reached its record high of 44 in 2000, the confidence index hit a record low.
But as the market fell from its 2000 peak, the confidence index rose to high levels again, where it remained until recently.
This year, the index took a dive for individual investors, and now is at the lowest level since 2000.
The confidence of professional investors has fallen, too, but not as sharply.
In short, people are beginning to worry.
Yet valuations remain high, and it would be comforting if they made sense.
So I’ve been trying to come up with a theory to explain today’s elevated stock prices — and maybe convince myself that they could remain lofty for some time.
One factor to consider is that bond prices are high, too.
Inflation is running at only around 2 percent, and 10-year Treasury notes yield less than 2.
Bond prices move in the opposite direction as interest rates, and high bond prices may account for the high valuations in stocks.
The inverse was certainly true in the late 1970s and early ’80s, when inflation and Treasury yields were in the double digits.
Back in 1979, Franco Modigliani of M.
Cohn of the University of Hartford argued that investors were then undervaluing the stock market, because they failed to perceive that despite high inflation, real interest rates were relatively modest.
The two men rightly predicted that there would be a stock market boom if inflation fell significantly — as we now know it began to do within a year after they made their case.
It’s possible that bond prices account for today’s stock market valuations.
But that raises another question: Why are bond prices so high.
There are short-term explanations: the role of central banks, for example.
But is there a compelling reason for prices of stocks and bonds (and maybe houses, too) to remain high indefinitely.
I’ve looked for untraditional answers.
Perhaps today’s prices have something to do with anxiety about the future.
I suspect that after the financial crisis, working people are much more worried about their future pay.
Many are concerned that they might lose their jobs to cost-cutting, or that they might eventually be replaced by a computer or robot or website.
Such anxiety might push them to try to make up for these potential shortfalls by investing in stocks and bonds — even if they worry that these assets are overvalued.
Extrapolating from a theory of Robert E.
of the University of Chicago, one might well expect lofty stock prices amid such worries: When there aren’t enough good investing opportunities, people wishing to save more for the future may succeed only in bidding up existing assets even if they think they’re overpriced.
Call it the “life preserver on the Titanic” theory.
This explanation, though, is probably not the whole story.
The problem, as shown in my work with Sanford Grossman, founder of QFS Asset Management, and in work by Lars Peter Hansen of the University of Chicago and Kenneth Singleton of Stanford, is that the market just moves up and down more than Professor Lucas’s theory would suggest.
So nothing I’ve come up with is a slam-dunk explanation for the continuing high level of valuations.
I suspect that the real answers lie largely in the realm of sociology and social psychology — in phenomena like irrational exuberance, which, eventually, has always faded before.
If the mood changes again, stock market investments may disappoint us.
They say politics makes strange bedfellows, but surely that’s because politics is just another kind of job.
For most of us, the strange bedfellows we’re most likely to encounter are the ones at the office or the plant or wherever it is we happen to work.
In Heidi Schreck’s new play, “The Consultant,” the unlikely colleagues are drawing paychecks at Sutton Feingold McGrath, a small pharmaceutical advertising agency in New York that is in the throes of becoming a lot smaller thanks to the economic collapse of 2008.
You wouldn’t guess from the sleek furnishings in the world-premiere production at Long Wharf Theater‘s Stage II that the firm has fallen on hard times, but Ms.
Schreck’s engaging characters, whether supremely capable or barely coping, know that their heads are on the chopping block.
Smart and smartly dressed, Tania (Cassie Beck) is one of the capable ones.
A little more than a receptionist and a little less than an office manager, she spends much of her day dryly telling callers that the person they’re looking for no longer works there.
She’s been carrying on a flirtation with Mark (Darren Goldstein), an affable managerial type, and covering as best she can for Jun Suk (Nelson Lee), a designer whose marital troubles are interfering with his job performance.
Then there’s the consultant of the title, Amelia (Clare Barron), a forlorn, somewhat clueless graduate student who’s been hired through her school — undoubtedly to save money — to help the designer get his act together before his next presentation.
With her slacker outfits — Jessica Pabst designed the credible costumes — and eager-beaver nervousness, Amelia couldn’t look any less professional.
Barron’s wide-eyed gaze, fidgety hands and slouching posture make Amelia an absurd teacher of corporate cool for Mr.
Lee’s Jun Suk, who in any case needs an antidepressant, not artificial hand gestures.
Only 22, Amelia has a good excuse for her fecklessness.
But as we learn more about the staff at Sutton Feingold McGrath, we find that the older characters are not necessarily any more adult or self-aware than she is.
The play’s director, Kip Fagan, underlines the characters’ silliness by encouraging his appealing performers’ flair for physical comedy.
In a wonderful scene set in the spiffy glass-walled conference room designed by Andrew Boyce, with Matt Frey’s lighting capturing the fluorescent glare of the modern workplace and Daniel Kluger’s sound design adding a slight reverb to emphasize its inhumanity, Ms.
Lee have good fun with the nuances of body language.
Amelia demonstrates to Jun Suk the behavior that will supposedly convey an air of calm confidence when he talks to clients, and he stiffly, robotically mimics her moves, revealing not just his character’s distraction but his despair.
Like much of the play, this scene has a wry futility that bows to both Chekhov and “The Office” without quite matching either.
Amelia and Jun Suk are not alone in needing help.
Everyone in “The Consultant” is either giving or looking for advice, and not always in a logical place.
Tania lets Amelia come to her rescue during a Catch-22 telephone conversation with her bank, and boy, is that a mistake.
When Barbara (Lynne McCollough), an ex-employee, shows up at the reception desk, she sizes up Amelia as a potential recruit for her self-help seminars and assures her, “Your life can be whatever you imagine it can be.
” Mark gives Jun Suk tips on how to get rid of ants, Tania solicits Amelia’s opinion of Mark, Jun Suk quotes “More I Cannot Wish You,” a quintessential advice song from “Guys and Dolls,” and Mark gets crucial information on how to choose flowers not just from Amelia but also from a complete stranger in the street.
Schreck is an Obie-winning performer — she was seen at Long Wharf in 2011 in Simon Gray’s “The Old Masters” — as well as a playwright, and, like many actors who turn to writing, she knows what plays.
Her dialogue is crisp, funny and believable, and “The Consultant” never bogs down along the way.
But it is taking a trip to nowhere.
Ultimately it is done in by the same lack of focus and reflection that afflicts the characters.
Their stumbling workdays provide neither a sharp critique of the political and economic forces buffeting them nor revelatory insights into their inner lives.
At the end, “The Consultant” takes a surprising turn toward the dark, and all we can take away is what we knew coming in: Workplaces make strange bedfellows.
The Obama administration in 2013 released nearly 68,000 undocumented immigrants who had criminal records – many of them in New York and New Jersey, according to a new review of immigration data.
The shocking numbers came from a report released Monday by the Center for Immigration Studies, a conservative think tank that studies immigration patterns.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement data showed that New York’s ICE office released 5,391 – about 71 percent of the 7,571 criminal undocumented immigrants it encountered, a rate second only to San Antonio, which released 79 percent.
The Newark office came in fourth, releasing 2,149 about 60 percent of 3,581, right behind third-place Washington DC, which released 64 percent.
Nationally, the 67,879 criminals released represented about 35 percent of all undocumented immigrants with convictions ICE encountered, according to the report, titled “Catch and Release.
” Since June 2011, when the first of the administration’s “prosecutorial discretion” policies went into effect, ICE arrests have declined by 40 percent, the report said.
“These figures suggest that despite claims of a focus on public safety, the administration’s prosecutorial discretion criteria are allowing factors such as family relationships, political considerations, or attention from advocacy groups to trump criminal convictions as a factor leading to deportation,” said the report, written by CIS director of policy studies Jessica Vaughan.
An ICE spokeswoman defended the feds efforts to get undocumented criminals out of the country.
“ICE is focused on the removal of criminal aliens.
In Fiscal Year 2013 the agency removed 216,000 convicted criminals.
The percentage of criminals removed continues to rise,” said ICE rep Dani Bennett.
“Nearly 60 percent of ICE’s total removals had been previously convicted of a criminal offense, and that number rises to 82 percent for individuals removed from the interior of the US.
The removal of criminal individuals is and will remain ICE’s highest priority.

When Mitt Romney mentioned the “Creator” in the debate Wednesday, he owned it.
“We’re all children of the same God,” he said.
That’s about 85 percent of the country he was talking to.
That should have been President Obama’s constituency but he let Romney have it as he let Romney have the debate.
Citing the Declaration of Independence, Romney said: “Second, is that line that says we are endowed by our Creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country.
That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose.
I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can’t care for themselves are cared by — by one another.
Part of claiming your citizenship is claiming a belief in God, even if you are not Christian.
We’ve got the Creator in our Declaration of Independence.
We’ve got “In God We Trust” on our coins.
We’ve got “one nation under God” in our Pledge of Allegiance.
And we say prayers in the Senate and the House of Representatives to God.
An atheist could never get elected dog catcher, much less president.
Pete Stark of California is a nontheist but doesn’t talk much about it).
Up until now, the idea of being American and believing in God were synonymous.
When the Republicans tried to take away the flag it took a long time for the Democrats to realize they had been hijacked.
For years, Democrats were wary of wearing flag pins for fear of seeming to pander.
The Republicans have claimed God as their own this entire campaign, each candidate trying to out-Christian the other.
Even Obama, though 17 percent of registered voters think he is a Muslim, has talked about being a Christian as often as he can.
Still, none of Obama’s references have been in a debate.
And there was Obama– grim faced, nervous, fumbling his words and wearing his American flag pin — letting Romney, confident and aggressive and in control, roll right over him at every turn.
If Obama wants to win the next debate, he needs to wear God, as much as it offends him to do so, the same way he captured the flag for this one.
Wallach: ‘Jewish humor is inherently never mean or vindictive’.
Roberto Saviano ([roˈbɛrto saˈvjano]; born September 22, 1979) is an Italian writer and journalist.
In his writings, articles, television programs, and books he employs prose and news-reporting style to narrate the story of the Camorra (a powerful Neapolitan mafia-like organization), exposing its territory and business connections.
Since 2006, following the publication of his bestselling book Gomorrah (Gomorra in Italian), where he describes the clandestine particulars of the Camorra business, Saviano has been threatened by several Neapolitan "godfathers".
The Italian Minister of the Interior has granted him a permanent police escort.
Because of his courageous stance, he is considered a "national hero" by author-philosopher Umberto Eco.
He lives at a secret location to avoid reprisal attacks for his book about the mafia, Gomorrah.
[1] Saviano was also accused by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of defaming the country and being unpatriotic.
Saviano was born in Naples on September 22, 1979.
His father was Catholic while his mother was Jewish.
[2] He graduated in philosophy at the University of Naples Federico II.
His writing is influenced by anti-fascist thinkers such as Giustino Fortunato, Gaetano Salvemini[3] and conservative authors such as Ernst Jünger, Ezra Pound, Louis Ferdinand Celine, and Carl Schmitt.
[4] As a journalist, he collaborates with L'Espresso and La Repubblica, and other magazines including: Nuovi Argomenti, Lo Straniero, Nazione Indiana, and Sud, and can be found in various anthologies such as Best Off.
Il meglio delle riviste letterarie italiane (2005), and Napoli comincia a Scampia (2005).
In 2006, following the success of the non-fiction Gomorra[5] (Gomorrah in English[6]), which denounces the activities of the Camorra, Saviano received ominous threats.
These have been confirmed by the collaborators for justice and reports that have revealed attempts on Saviano's life, by the Casalesi clan.
Investigators have claimed the Camorra selected Casalesi clan boss Giuseppe Setola to kill Saviano over the book, although the alleged hit never occurred.
[7] After the Neapolitan Police investigations the Italian Minister for Interior Affairs Giuliano Amato assigned a personal bodyguard and transferred him from Naples.
In autumn 2008, the informant Carmine Schiavone, cousin of the imprisoned Casalesi clan boss Francesco Schiavone, revealed to the authorities that the clan had planned to eliminate Saviano and his police escort by Christmas on the motorway between Rome and Naples with a bomb;[8][9] in the same period, Saviano announced his intention to leave Italy, in order to stop having to live as a convict and reclaim his life.
[10] On October 20, 2008, six Nobel Prize-awarded authors and intellectuals (Orhan Pamuk, Dario Fo, Rita Levi-Montalcini, Desmond Tutu, Günter Grass, and Mikhail Gorbachev) published an article in which they say that they side with Saviano against Camorra, and they think that Camorra is not just a problem of security and public order, but also a democratic one.
They also think that the Italian government must protect his life, and help Saviano in having a normal life.
Signatures are collected on the site of the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
On December 10, 2009, in the presence of Nobel Prize winner Dario Fo, Saviano received the title of Honorary Member of the Academy of Fine Arts of Brera and the Second Level Academic Diploma in Communication and Art Teaching Honoris Causa, the highest recognition by the Brera Academy equivalent to a postgraduate degree.
Saviano dedicated the awards to the people from the south of Italy living in Milan.
Saviano contributed an op-ed piece to the January 24, 2010 issue of the New York Times entitled, "Italy's African Heroes".
[11] He wrote about the January 2010 riots between African immigrants and Italians in Rosarno, a town in Calabria.
Saviano suggests that the Africans' rioting was more of a response to their exploitation by the 'Ndrangheta, or Calabrian mafia, than to the hostility of native Italians.
On November 2010 he started hosting, with Fabio Fazio, the Italian television program "Vieni via con me", broadcast by Rai 3.
[12] His second book, ZeroZeroZero,[13] was published by Feltrinelli in 2013.
This book is a study of the business around the drug cocaine, covering its movement across continents and the role of drug money in international finance.

The sandwich chain Jimmy John's confirmed Wednesday that hackers stole customer debit and credit card data from 216 of its stores, making the company the latest in a string of cyberattacks against major retailers and restaurants.
A hacker stole login credentials from credit card readers at corporate and franchised locations between June 16 and Sept.
5 of this year, the restaurant chain said in a statement on its website.
It learned of the breach on July 30 and hired security experts to help with its investigation.
Jimmy John’s is based in Champaign, Illinois, and has about 1,900 locations.
It said the cards impacted were only those swiped at the stores, and not ones entered manually or online.
It did not say how many cards were stolen, but said its investigation is still ongoing and it is now safe to use credit and debit cards at its locations.
On its website, the restaurant posted a listing of stores affected by the breach, spanning from Florida to California.
Jimmy John’s also said it has taken steps to tighten security by installing machines that encrypt credit card data and is “reviewing its policies and procedures for its third party vendors.
” While the statement suggested another company may have been the cause of the breach, it did not disclose the company’s name.
However, cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs reported nearly two months ago that the theft of cards at Jimmy John's was caused by a cyberattack on a company called Signature Systems, which makes card readers for restaurants.
Krebs reported that banks were seeing a pattern of fraud on cards recently used at Jimmy John’s locations around the country.
Signature Systems did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Jimmy John's is one of the several stores hacked within the last year, including Home Depot, Target, Neiman Marcus and P.
Union workers are coming to Bruce Ratner’s rescue — again.
— agreeing to take massive pay cuts to pave the way for the first residential building at Atlantic Yards, a cut-rate, pre-fabricated tower to rise next to the Barclays Center.
Labor unions provided crucial support for Ratner when his controversial, $5-billion project was moving through the approval process five years ago in exchange for a promise of high-paying jobs.
But the agreement currently being negotiated between union leaders and Ratner, workers would give up millions of dollars in pay to allow the developer to move forward with the cheaper, modular building.
It is unclear how much money will be lost to laborers, but carpenters make as much as $90 an hour in wages and benefits at real construction sites, but only $30 per hour when working inside the kind of factory where Ratner will build the pre-fabricated units.
Many union leaders merely shrugged when asked about the pay cuts, suggesting that if the workers don’t give back, the project might not go ahead, leaving laborers with no work at all.
“We are attempting to reach an agreement … that will work for the building trades,” said Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council.
A labor union source translated LaBarbera for those who don’t speak the language of press releases.
“The unions are going to do what it takes to preserve jobs for their members,” said the source.
“The wage scale is ultimately going to be [the deciding factor].
This is going to be a long process.
” Ratner released renderings last week of a 32-story modular building rising at the corner of Dean Street and Flatbush Avenue, just south of his under-construction $1-billion basketball arena.
The building would be the tallest pre-fab structure on the planet.
Two identical-looking pre-fab building would come later — and one of them would be 50-plus stories, which would break its predecessor’s height record for Lego–style towers.
Ratner says he will begin construction early next year, with ground-breakings for the others following at six to nine-month intervals after that — the first of three residential buildings in the long stalled, 16-tower development.
The first tower would be constructed using 930 pre-fabricated steel boxes known as modules that would be built in a factory and transported to Dean Street, where they would be bolted into place.
Ratner hailed the method, which he said would cut costs by up to 25 percent, but union members would face far bigger pay cuts.
Unions had supported the project from the outset because of its promise of thousands of jobs.
Those same union supporters are already angered by a shortfall of positions on the project.
The pre-fab design would also save money because it would take less time to build: the world’s tallest modular building, a 25-story dormitory in Wolverhampton, England, was built in less than one year.
But the project faces significant design challenges, according to architects who reviewed the renderings.
“The modules would have to be built on an assembly line basis and that capacity doesn’t really exist [on this size],” said Jim Garrison, whose modular design firm in DUMBO declined an offer from Ratner last year to help produce the plan.
“The rational thing to do is build a 20-story building and test these things out before building a 30-story tower.
” “It’s another despicable slight to the community surrounding the project by eliminating more crucial jobs for residents,” said Councilwoman Letitia James (D–Fort Greene).
James and others felt similarly slighted by the notion that a project that was once meant to be an architectural showcase by legendary designer Frank Gehry will now comprise far more mundane pre-fab buildings.
Gehry was fired in 2009 in a cost-saving move.
Ratner’s spokesman Joe DePlasco said that the developer will begin to seek financing for the first building, but declined to comment further.
When Diane Jean Schemo dedicated a recent New York Times education column, “It Takes More Than Schools To Close The Achievement Gap,” to the proposition that anti-poverty economic and social programs were as necessary for significantly narrowing the achievement gap as educational reform, she cited Richard Rothstein’s important work on that subject, Class and Schools.
This led, in turn, to a number of uninformed summary judgments on Rothstein’s arguments.
Now, in a clinic on how to demolish an opposing argument, Rothstein provides first round knockouts of two critics — Checker Finn and Joel Klein.
Unfortunately, this is a classic case of an issue where logical argument goes only so far, because there are very real — and very powerful — interests with a stake in ignoring the need for battling poverty.
They want to talk only about what schools can do, because they do not want to hold elected officials and the corporate world responsible for what they should be doing.
But Rothstein’s piece will make it harder to pretend that this is a posture which cares about the best interests of children living in poverty.
Weighted School Funding (WSF) is the new magic-bullet darling of the conservative education think tanks.
First proposed earlier this summer in a report by the Thomas B.
Fordham Foundation, and next week the subject of a Center for American Progress conference in Washington featuring Rod Paige, John Podesta and others, it cleverly cloaks an anti-teacher wolf in pro-child sheepskin with a new way to resolve all the inequities that plague education finance today.
Under this intra-district school funding method, dollars would follow the student to whatever public school his/her family chooses.
(Some WSF advocates would omit the “public” in that sentence.
) The dollars would reflect that child’s educational needs, and ensure that whatever school s/he attended would have fair funding and equally qualified teachers.
For years, critics have blamed the unequal distribution of experienced teachers between schools in richer and poorer communities on labor contract provisions that give senior teachers preference in school placements and transfers.
Now that NYC has eliminated seniority transfers, another culprit must be found.
WSF supporters say this inequitable teacher distribution is the result of the way school districts allocate funding to schools.
They argue that measured in real dollars schools in poor communities actually get much less funding than schools in richer communities, even after factoring in poverty-related funds like Title 1, because of the relatively low pay of their teachers, and this is clearly discriminatory.
The WSF remedy is for districts to send dollars, weighted for student needs, to schools, instead of allocating positions.
Then schools in poor communities would receive more money and be better able to recruit more experienced teachers.
But they do not say how this would happen.
What will change the competitive disadvantage of schools in poorer neighborhoods with greater challenges and tougher working conditions.
And what will reduce the greater teacher attrition rate in those schools.
Under the current system, funding for teachers is provided to schools irrespective of the cost of the teachers.
When schools are allocated positions, principals are free to hire teachers at any level of experience/cost.
The fact that they have trouble doing so is not a function of what they have to spend but of the more difficult working conditions in their schools.
If they have dollars and not positions, won’t many principals prefer less experienced, cheaper teachers and shun senior teachers, thus freeing up more money for other needs.
Would this not lead to age discrimination in hiring.
WSF supporters say that principals won’t do that because they are held accountable for results, and so will seek the best teachers.
But principals may think that other uses of those funds, like hiring test-prep companies, might raise scores more than experienced teachers would.
With WSF, proponents argue, more affluent schools would receive less funding and could no longer afford to hire all-senior staffs.
This would free up more senior teachers to be hired by poor schools.
But in areas like NYC, surrounded by more affluent school districts, it may also cause more senior teachers to flee to the suburbs.
one argument put forth by a WSF advocate (Paul Hill in Harvard Educational Review, Summer 2006) is that “many quality teachers want to work in [“troubled”] schools but they know that doing so goes against the incentives created by the placement system and school budget.
Fearing they could be the only experienced teacher in a difficult situation, most teachers choose to work elsewhere.
” That is a real stretch, not backed by any study of why teachers choose or reject schools in which to work that I know of.
Hill concludes that under WSF, “schools in low-income neighborhoods would have more money than their current teachers earn and would be able to bid for some of the experienced teachers who came along.
” Again, with the current system of neutral funding, those schools can “bid” for those teachers now, and if they succeed, they will have the money to pay for them because he district funds positions, regardless of their cost.
If WSF supporters want to enable schools in rough neighborhoods to attract and retain more experienced teachers, they might consider several potentially more effective alternatives, like decent facilities, smaller classes and enough books, materials and supplies so teachers can do their jobs.
In addition, targeted strategies can help: · More support for new teachers in those schools, including lighter teaching loads and more time for training, preparing and observing other teachers.
· Opportunities for advancement for mid-level teachers, including taking on more responsibilities (like mentoring, curriculum development, planning school-wide projects) for additional pay.
· Extra pay for teachers who meet qualifications and volunteer to teach in hard-to-staff schools.
Those are to-the-point solutions to help bring the best teachers to where they are most needed.
But could the WSF advocates really have another objective in mind.
Read Hill’s explanation of why low-income children get the least experienced teachers.
He calls it the result of “a deliberate policy of budgetary distortion.
” And, he says, “Districts have adopted [this policy] for one reason only — to enable implementation of the seniority placement provisions of collective bargaining agreements.
” Of course, we should have known.
It always comes back to the teacher unions.
Well, if seniority placements was the problem, then the elimination of the seniority transfer plan should be the dawn of a new day in equity for children in NYC.
And if it turns out that, even after some 3,000 transfers under the new Open Market system, some schools still manage to attract the most highly qualified teachers while others don’t, perhaps the pundits will have to look for something else to blame.
Like maybe someone should look at those successful schools and see that they are professional communities where the conditions respect both the teachers and the students.
Maybe that’s the elusive magic bullet to bring all students better schools and the best teachers.
The second shoe of the study the US Department of Education wishes desperately it had never commissioned fell earlier this week, with the publication of the section comparing the performance of public district schools and charter schools.
One knew well in advance what it would say, since the Department has been madly leaking the results to its allies among charter school advocates — some of whom spent the better part of August launching pre-emptive missles.
But for those who don’t live and die on reading the tea leaves of edu-blogs, the bottom line of the report is this: when controlled for demographic categories such as poverty, race and ethnicity, gender and English language learners, students in public district schools significantly outperformed students in charter schools on NAEP English Language Arts and Mathematics assessments.
A bit anti-climatic, after all of the pre-release prognostication, but no less significant for it.
If you wonder why folks like Eduwonk are spinning like there is no tomorrow about this study, it is because they asked for it.
To understand how this came to be, one needs to go back to the infamous ‘charter school dust up,’ when the AFT released the raw NAEP data the US DOE had been hiding, which showed that public district school students were doing better on the NAEP assessments than charter school students.
At that time, the charter partisans argued that it was an unfair comparison, since in their opinion, charter schools served a student population which was poorer, with more students of color and English Language Learners, than that of the public district schools.
While the underlying premise — that charter schools served more student living in poverty, more students of color and more English Language Leaders — was highly questionable, the argument that we should be comparing student apples with student apples and student oranges with student oranges was valid.
In fact, it was the same argument that public school advocates had often made when public schools were unfairly compared to private schools, a practice not unknown among charter school partisans like Checker Finn and Jeannie Allen.
So it was largely because of the urging of charter school partisans that the US DOE commissioned this study — this is one of those classic “be careful what you ask for, because you might actually get it” moments.
Some might take schadenfreude in these events, and in the mad spinning, but it is really a sad development.
This is a critical moment in the emergence of charter schools.
The movement is desperately in need of voices that eshew the escalation of rhetoric, the name calling and the circling of the wagons, voices that refuse the transparent arguments of diversion, voices that say it is time for self-reflection, and for a focus on improving the quality of charter schools.
Now, more than ever, we need to figure out why a movement established to provide more good public schools, especially for students in poor communities, has fallen far short of that promise.
It’s a little difficult to understand what Andres Alonso finds so “extraordinarily surprising” about the decline in minority enrollment in the city’s top high schools.
This is bad news, surely, but not extraordinarily surprising to anyone who understands the pitfalls of relying on a single standardized test in assessing student achievement.
Those of us who have spent our careers in classrooms understand that.
Those who us who have not, like Mr.
Using data supplied by the DoE, the NY Times reports that black and Hispanic enrollment has declined at Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Tech.
, and Bronx High School of Science.
These declines parallel the Department’s change to a an admission policy that ignored student achievement as assessed by the teachers (i.
And since standards on these tests are believed to be more rigorous than standards held by teachers, the inevitable conclusion seems to be that the test-only policy employed by the DoE was simply too rigorous for some minorities.
Ironically, however, a test-only policy relaxes (rather than raises) admission standards, and cheats our best students, including some blacks and Hispanics.
In other words, the problem may not be that the test-only policy is too rigorous for blacks, Hispanics, or other students who do not make the cut.
Rather, the policy is not rigorous enough.
This is not, of course, immediately apparent.
The truth will come out on tests, the knee-jerk thinking goes; either the student can do the work, or he cannot.
Heather MacDonald of the Manhattan Institute typifies this kind of thinking perfectly when she equates a single standardized admissions test with “maintaining legitimately high standards”.
MacDonald is a non-practicing lawyer, and she has never taught in secondary schools.
Ask a teacher about an admission policy that ignores classroom success and failure and you are likely to get a different answer.
That’s because teachers know that success on a test does not always translate into real academic achievement.
Some top scorers, just like students at any level, may avoid new challenges, neglect to do assignments, and generally shut themselves off to academic experiences that could broaden and deepen their understanding of the world.
And since this is the case, then how rigorous are admission standards that reward a student who can ace the test but who rarely writes a thoughtful essay or asks a thought-provoking question while in class.
Does the high scorer who squeaks by with a 75 in middle school Social Studies deserve a seat at Stuyvesant.
To be sure, many high scorers are also excellent students.
Nonetheless, smart students with indifferent attitudes toward academics are more common than one might think.
And, since acceptance based on a single test must involve a cut-off score (let’s pretend a 93), then the student with the 92 who welcomes every opportunity to learn is pushed aside so that his less enthusiastic classmate can have the much-sought high school seat.
Thus, the problem with the test-only admissions policy is not that it discriminates minorities, but that it discriminates against all those students who have truly passed the “rigor” test by doing very well on standard tests and meeting the daily demands required for sustained academic excellence.
What is more, however, once we consider both parts of the equation as factors in admission, then we may very well find that our most academic schools are not only able to maintain “legitimately high standards” (to quote MacDonald) but are also more racially diverse.
Of course, this is only one woman’s opinion (mine), and I am not personally familiar with any of these schools.
Ultimately Klein and the DoE must seek the input of the school communities before any decisions are made about how, if at all, to change the policies in the specialized schools.
Unfortunately, however, the chancellor has recently done precisely the opposite by imposing on one of the city’s best-performing schools (Staten Island Tech.
) the testing system that his own statistics now show does not work.
Until this year, Tech employed a rigorous admission policy that accepted students based on a “power score” comprised of both standardized test scores and middle school grades.
Tech’s is one of the very best schools in the city, with scores and statistics that are in every way comparable or superior to those of Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Tech, or Bronx High School of Science.
But what is perhaps more interesting is that in a predominantly white borough with almost 50 percent fewer black students than Manhattan, and 66 percent fewer Hispanics, Tech.
has the about same percentage of blacks and Hispanics as can be found at Stuyvesant.
The numbers are small, and Tech.
is still not as diverse as the borough’s general student population.
Nonetheless, by using both grades and tests, Tech seems to have been more successful at creating a truly rigorous standard that gave an enriched opportunity to a diverse population.
Unfortunately, Klein and Bloomberg have brought that admission policy to an end.
In January of 2005 these two made a pit-stop at Tech to inform the school that it would have to switch to a test-only admission.
When some school community members protested, Klein replied that the new policy would make the school more diverse.
Thus we see the DoE at its most typical: imposing a policy without looking at the facts.
In the end, in a pro-forma meeting that would later give the DoE the opportunity of claiming it had been collaborative, students, parents, and school staff were given a choice.
Accept the test-only admissions or see your funding cut.
Accept it or eliminate any admission policy.
Accept it or you will no longer exist.
So, Staten Island Tech accepted the test.
And this September, for the first time since it opened its doors, those doors will only be open to students who scored well on a single test.
It will be closed, however, to those who scored only slightly less well, but showed their teachers that they have what it takes to be great students every single day of the year.
There were two important pieces of public education news that will be hitting various papers, and news outlets over the next few days.
John at the AFT has a rundown of both pieces of news.
First the annual Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll on the public’s attitudes towards public schools was release.
John at the AFT summarizes: NCLB Ain’t Helping: 37% say NCLB has made no difference in the performance of schools in the community, and 21% say it has hurt those schools.
) Update: Eduwonk correctly calls me out on the use of the word “just” in the previous sentence.
College Isn’t for Everyone: But college prep is for most people.
56% said all high school students should take courses that prepare them to enter a four-year college; 42% said no.
More than the Basics 78% are concerned that NCLB’s current testing requirements – English and math only – will mean “less emphasis on art, music, history and other subjects.
” No Transfers Asked what they would want if their child attended a school put on NCLB’s “needs improvement” list, 4 out of 5 respondents said they preferred improving the child’s present school rather than being allowed to transfer the child to another school.
The Bush Administration’s Department of Education also released the results of a charter school/public school study of NAEP scores.
Department of Education (ED) today released a report showing, as expected, that charter school student performance on fourth-grade NAEP reading and math tests lags behind that of students in regular public schools when student background characteristics are taken into account.
The big-picture numbers: charter school students were 4.
2 points lower on the reading tests, 4.
(A rule of thumb for NAEP scores is that 10 points equals one year of learning, so it could be said that students in charter schools are nearly a half-year behind students with similar backgrounds who attend regular public schools.
) Students at charter schools “affiliated with a public school district” outperformed students at charter schools that were not affiliated with a public school district.
For central city schools serving a high-minority population, students at regular schools outperformed students in charter schools on the NAEP math test.
AP’s first pass on the report — there may be another one later — includes this hopeful tidbit: “The report offered some good news for charter schools: Reading scores at charter schools in central cities serving mostly minority students were comparable to scores at traditional public schools.
However, math scores at such charter schools still lagged behind those at traditional schools.
” So, what’s the good news for charter schools.
Oh, I see — in one subject, but not the other, they are doing as well as the most maligned schools in the country: urban schools with large numbers of minority students.
And Bloomberg’s write-up seems designed to knock down the study.
It quotes two people — a Bush appointee and a charter school advocate — criticizing the study, not a one saying it was any good.
The Response The National Association for Charter School Authorizers says this report is “old news” using “old data.
But if the facts don’t influence policies, then they need to be repeated.
While you’re at the AFT’s NCLBlog don’t miss this post.
Is there a better way to teach Standard English grammar to students who speak African American English (AAE) or other English varieties.
As I prepare for my second year of teaching in NYC public high schools, I have been pondering this question.
Last year, I became quite frustrated with teaching grammar in my regular ELA class.
I saw that my students desperately needed to learn Standard English for their upcoming Regents exam, yet I was frustrated with both their resistance and seeming inability to grasp the concepts.
My students kept making the same mistakes over and over again, as if they didn’t even realize they were making them.
I started noticing the same patterns over and over in many of my student’s writing – particularly problems with subject-verb agreement, plurals, and possession.
I would dutifully point these errors out in their papers, and sometimes even mention them in class, to no avail.
Many wanted to learn, but it just didn’t seem to come to them the way it did for me, and I couldn’t understand why my corrections didn’t seem to help.
In fact, the more I corrected, the more they resisted.
Teaching grammar explicitly has gone out of fashion.
No more diagramming sentences, rote memorization, or decontextualized exercises.
However, simply correcting student papers, offering support during the writing process, and teaching the occasional mini-lesson (the way I’d been taught to teach in grad school ala Constance Weaver and her book, Teaching Grammar in Context) is clearly not enough or maybe just not the right framework from which to teach my population of students.
After all, my students are not going to learn Standard English by osmosis, and it’s unfair to penalize them for what I’m not really teaching.
According to Code-switching: Teaching Standard English in Urban Classrooms by Rebecca S.
Wheeler and Rachel Swords, my students are not chronically making errors in grammar or speaking “lazy” English.
Rather, they are following the patterns of their language variety or dialect.
What if I taught them from a similar framework as I would teach Standard English to English Language Learners.
What if I use their dialect, their existing knowledge, as a “springboard” to Standard English (SE).
Many of my students have been speaking a dialect of English their whole lives, so it’s clearly not the same thing as learning a second language, but there are many parallels.
Wheeler and Swords tell us we can expect to see a “grammatical echo” of the first language in the student’s expression of another language or of another dialect (Wheeler and Swords 9).
We see grammatical echoes whether the student’s home language is Thai, Spanish, or Hindi; whether their home dialect is South Asian English, South African English, or African American English (AAE).
Wheeler and Swords urge us to first, collect observations and data on our students’ home dialects, and then use “contrastive analysis”, rather than the traditional “correctionist approach,” which has clearly failed with students of color (Wheeler and Swords 61).
Contrastive analysis teaches students to code-switch from one variety to another, depending on what is appropriate and effective for the situation (Wheeler and Swords 57).
They use the example of a student who says, “Mama jeep need gas.
” Rather than correct the student’s “error”, a contrastive approach would, in one lesson, look at the differences between the rules of possession according to AAE and the rules according to SE.
In a subsequent lesson, students would look at differences in subject-verb agreement.
These rules and examples would be listed side by side on a chart that would remain up for students’ reference.
Sometimes students will be required to write in SE, for example in formal writing, and at other times students may choose to write in dialect.
The idea is that students will be conscious of the choices they are making and understand what situations call for speaking and writing in SE.
Green, who wrote African American English: A Linguistic Introduction, agrees.
She also advises teachers to teach grammar explicitly, and that teachers “offer direct instruction in pointing out and teaching the correspondences between AAE and mainstream English” (Green 236).
Furthermore, she advises teachers to become familiar with students’ dialect patterns because “teachers who know something about the children’s native linguistic system are less likely to misclassify their grammatical linguistic patterns as mainstream English errors or disorders and are more likely to understand them as differences” (Green 240).
Additionally, she asks us to think about literary giants such as Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, and Toni Morrison, all of whom exhibit not only a mastery of SE but also of AAE and are able to move between them for a powerful literary effect.
Our students can strive for the same mastery of language, but only if we teach them in a way that respects AAE and makes the similarities and differences explicit.
Code-switching is not about getting rid of Standard English.
On the contrary, code-switching recognizes the absolute necessity of speaking and writing Standard English in our society.
In Other People’s Children: Cultural Conflict in the Classroom, Lisa Delpit argues that students benefit from being taught explicitly the rules and “codes of power” of the middle class, including speaking and writing Standard English.
She says, “If you are not already a participant in the culture of power, being told explicitly the rules of that culture makes acquiring that power easier” (Delpit 25).
She goes on to argue that “if such explicitness is not provided to students, what it feels like to people who are old enough to judge is that there are secrets being kept, that time is being wasted, that the teacher is abdicating his or her duty to teach” (Delpit 31).
If my students just aren’t learning it the way I’m teaching it, don’t I have an obligation to find a better way.
To help them bridge the gaps, so they do understand.
Speaking and writing Standard English is so crucial for their success in college and the professional world, so crucial for their access to real power in society, that I consider it one of my primary obligations to find a way to teach it so they will learn.
Code-switching, quite simply, seems to be a more effective way to teach Standard English to students of color.
There is more at stake than simple pedagogical debates about the teaching of grammar.
It is about our prejudices and our expectations of certain students.
Whether Black or White, a teacher is likely to consider a child speaking African American English as slower, less able, and less intelligent that the child who speaks Standard English.
We call this dialect prejudice.
Nieto (2000) explains that as teacher expectations are reduced, so the child’s classroom performance diminishes.
We have found that as teachers understand more about the integrity of vernacular dialects and the structure and regularity of student language, they step away from dialect prejudice in the classroom.
Teachers come to see students as fully intelligent, capable, and worthy.
Their expectations for student performance rise, bringing to the classroom a self-fulfilling prophecy for success as their students work to master Standard English.
(Wheeler and Swords 14) It seems clear that teaching grammar through a “correctionist lens”, without acknowledging that vernacular dialects like African American English have their own rules and grammar, is not only unhelpful and bound to fail, but in fact detrimental to students’ school experiences and eventual success.
However, respecting students’ cultures and language varieties, building and adding to their knowledge, and providing access to the “codes of power,” can be tremendously empowering for students.
With this approach, hopefully my students will be better prepared for their bright futures.
The writer is a second year teacher in New York City.
She writes about this subject and others at her blog, Syntactic Gymnastics.
The views expressed here are her own, and meant to foster dialogue.
The Department of Ed decision to end Evening High School because too many kids are failing is akin to closing hospital emergency rooms because too many patients die.
Students and teachers in Evening High Schools have been treated shabbily for decades.
The Department and their Board predecessors have steadfastly refused to negotiate class size in per session activities.
It is commonplace for an Evening High school teacher to receive a roster of sixty kids, forty show up on the first day and by the end of the term twenty kids are attending.
Students drop out of school to take care of their child, or a sibling, or a sick parent.
Other kids have to work to support themselves or their families while for others the importance of school didn’t “click” for a few years.
“Night” school offered an opportunity, to earn credits and enable them to receive a diploma.
When Andres Alonso was appointed as the highest academic position in the Department I was flabbergasted … he had never been a superintendent, a principal or an assistant principal, in fact, he had never taught in New York City.
He had been a special ed teacher in Newark and had a law degree from Harvard.
Would the military promote a private to be a general.
How about a line worker to become a CEO.
Are the current Regional Superintendents so inadequate that none of them can lead the Department.
And his first decision: close Evening High Schools.
Maybe I wasn’t seeing something … I called some high school counseling friends to ask them about this decision.
What was going to replace Night School.
Could schools create their own Night Schools.
All by the first weeks in September.
They all felt kids, the most vulnerable, were once again being screwed by those who should be advocating for them.
For Klein the “answer” is abolishing Teacher Contracts.
For Bloomberg the “answer” seems to be some “pay for performance” scheme.
For Alonso the “answer” seems to be to abolish programs for the neediest.
Increasingly our union, the UFT, is representing the interests of students and parents as well as it’s members.
Maybe we should establish some category of student or parent membership.
The Department leaders, Klein, Seidman and Alonso, lawyers all (perhaps Shakespeare was correct), are rigid ideologues who have alienated their work force as well as the parents of their constituents.
Our kids and their families cannot afford to wait until the Bloomberg era term limits, teachers, students and kids must band together and push back.
The lawyers will move on their to next job … education is our career and for our students education is the only chance for their future.
Schools aren’t laboratories to try out a “theory,” and students are guinea pigs.
What’s interesting about Checker Finn’s recent comments that the “muzzling” of Alfie Kohn was “noble work for education reformers” is not that he got the question wrong — that was predictible enough — but how he got it wrong.
When the organizers of an education conference invited Kohn to serve as the keynote speaker, the Massachusetts Department of Education threatened to withdraw its financial support for the conference if Kohn spoke.
The Department’s objections were based solely on Kohn’s rather unyielding, even dogmatic opposition to standardized testing in general, and to the Massachusetts system of high stakes exams, the MCAS, in particular.
In response to this strong-arm tactic, the conference organizers withdrew Kohn’s invitation to speak, although they still paid him his honorium.
That solution satisfied neither Kohn nor the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed suit on his behalf, charging a violation of First Amendment protections of freedom of speech.
Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Hiller B.
Zobel handed down a decision early in August which agreed with the ACLU and Kohn.
Enter Checker Finn, judicial critic at large.
The Massachusetts Department of Education is under no obligation to “subsidize” its critics, Finn tells us, and a decision to “not subsidize” is different from a decision to “silence,” since there are many other forums to which Kohn has access.
Moreover, Kohn still received a “non-trivial honorium,” so where is the harm.
With a different set of facts, the first part of Finn’s argument might have had some force.
If this were a Massachusetts Department of Education conference, it would be free to select speakers who would advocate for its policies, and under no obligation to give a platform to its critics.
If it wants to have a Checker Finn, as opposed to an Alfie Kohn, keynote its own conference, so that the praises of MCAS might ring from the rafters, it has every right to make that choice for itself.
But it can not compel others to conform to its choices, and it can not coerce others to refuse a platform to its critics.
Once the Massachusetts Department of Education ventures into the realm of providing financial support for educational conferences other institutions organize and run, it can only require “content neutral” limitations on what is said at those conferences, as a well settled matter of constitutional law.
In American jurisprudence, government simply can not require, nor can it forbid, particular speech acts from individuals and from institutions of civil society.
And in this instance, the Department’s financial coercion of the conference organizers to withdrew their invitation to Kohn was clearly based on the content of what he would say.
The second part of Finn’s argument is more interesting, if only because it goes straight to his rather limited conception of freedom of speech.
Finn has become the sort of free market fundamentalist who conceives of every freedom in terms of an individual property right, since for him the logic of the marketplace becomes the universal law which rules all.
What he does in this instance is what he does in his approach to all educational issues.
Since Kohn was paid the same fee he would have received if he had delivered his speech, Finn reasons that he suffered no damage.
But if one considers freedom of speech very deeply [or reads Madison on the subject], it quickly becomes apparent that the reason why we give that right such preeminence and such value has precious little to do with the property right of an individual to speak.
The republic will not rise or fall on whether Alfie Kohn’s particular voice is heard.
Rather, it is the right of the citizenry taken together to hear and consider a full range of views and opinions, as a necessary condition for coming to informed decisions, that makes freedom of speech so indispensable.
Freedom of speech is a necessary condition of democratic government, for the people can only be sovereign when it has the means to find and know its will.
This is why the freedom of political speech — and especially political speech critical of government policy — comes as close to an absolute right as any we exercise.
The republic is seriously threatened when the citizenry is denied the right to hear serious critics of the government and its policy, whomever they may be.
The irony here is that Kohn is probably not the most persuasive critic of the MCAS and the Massachusetts Department of Education.
His rhetoric relies heavily on hyperbole, and his argument rests on sweeping generalizations.
A more careful and precise critique, one which draws the necessary distinctions between appropriate and inappropriate uses of standardized tests, would be much more powerful.
The efforts to “muzzle” Kohn have given his broad brush criticisms of the MCAS more credibility than they would garner on their own: the Masschusetts Department of Education and Checker Finn are now two of his main publicists.
That may be a fitting fate for their anti-democratic hubris.
But it does no service to the people of Massachusetts, especially its students and its educators.
They would have been far better served by a full and free debate on the merits and demerits of the MCAS, in which Alfie Kohn’s voice was only one point of view.
Teachers do the best job they can in schools that are shrouded in the mists of poverty and social anarchy.
My wife was driving to a school meeting early one morning in the late seventies with Ed Muir, the first UFT Safety Director, he looked out the window and announced, “There’s nothing like the smell of burning buildings on a fall morning.
You could see across blocks of burned and abandoned building, and the only viable buildings were schools.
The crack epidemic unraveled social structure and destroyed a generation: and the greatest impact was on most defenseless, the children.
Whether it be crack or AIDs or gangs, or alcoholism: we teach the youngest victims, the children who enter their havens, the schools, and return to chaos that surrounds school buildings.
In spite of all the obstacles teachers do heroic jobs and many kids survive and prosper.
One of the encouraging aspects of the Children First Bloomberg initiative was the creation of an office in each region that dealt with issues apart from teaching and learning.
The Student Placement, Youth and Family Support Services (SPYFSS) Office shared space with each regional office and reported directly to a Deputy Chancellor at Tweed.
They focused on Attendance, Guidance, Children in Homeless Shelters, Student Suspension, Home Schooling, Drug Prevention, Parent Support, Community Based Organizations, Health Issues, i.
, the range of crucial issues beyond the scope of the classroom but impacting mightily on classroom performance.
Although the Tweed leadership changed, Lester Young, an experienced Community Superintendent left after a year and some SYPFSS offices were unwelcoming others became a beacon for schools.
Organizing Health Fairs in housing projects with high incidences of diabetes and obesity, creating collaborative “solutions” for schools with attendance issues, high quality school driven professional development for guidance counselors, and most importantly, working together with schools to resolve problems of individual kids and their families.
As these pages have so astutely noted critics of public schools, usually with no teaching experience, shunt aside the realities of poverty.
The NY Sun reports on a Blomberg commissioned study on how to “tackle” poverty, a commission member described a “Starbuck’s one-stop” approach to help New Yorkers to access city services.
David Jones, the CEO of the Community Service Society says he “pressed for youth programs to reach 16-to 24 year olds who are not working or in schools.
” However, the Tweed consultants, have decided the answer is to downsize student support services.
Half the SPYFSS offices are being closed, that’s right closed, and the remaining five offices are having their name changed to Office of Youth Development, with over two hundred schools per office.
A range of services previously provided by the offices will be shifted to regional offices.
The same offices that Klein has dismissed in his efforts to promote the new Empowerment Schools.
The consulting firm making these decisions is also redesigning the New Orleans School System and basically creating a new Charter school system along with a British company that redesigned school in the United Kingdom.
Lets see if I have this right: the Mayor’s Commission wants to target at risk 16 to 24 years olds while the Mayor’s Department of Education wants to abandon them.
Consultants are paid millions of dollars and the opinion of classroom teachers, parents and kids are ignored.
I’m sure the flow charts, the new designs, the power points are really impressive and I’m sure all the authors of these secret reports have fancy degrees from MBA programs.
Tomorrow or next week they will submit their report and move on their next job.
Kids, parents and teachers will still be here, having to clean up the Augean stables they have left behind.
Rightfully, we’ve been focused on what Ray Rice did to his then-fiancée.
But not enough attention is being given to the assault on Janay Rice on two other fronts.
Photo from Daily News From the Daily News: ROCKAWAY civic leaders are livid that sex offenders have moved into a troubled SRO on Beach 116th St.
after the owner promised to upgrade the property.
Danny Ruscillo, the president of the 100 Precinct Commnity Council, said he spotted notifications that two registered sex offenders recently moved into the building, which served as a halfway house before it was damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012.
The community successfully blocked efforts by a tenant of the building owner, Jay Deutchman, to turn it into a homeless shelter last year.
Ruscillo said Deutchman pledged in meetings he would put something there to benefit the community, so long as it paid his mortgage.
“Once again our community was misled,” said Ruscillo.
“It will adversely affect the Beach 116th St.
corridor and make it potentially an unsafe condition for the residents, especially the children, businesses and shoppers.
” Deutchman, however, said he had no idea that sex offenders were living in the building.
One of the individuals was classified as a potential high risk to the community.
“It doesn’t necessarily please me, but I don’t have children (living) in the building,” he said.
“It’s just an SRO and we are only renting to working people.
” Deutchman noted that he renovated the dilapidated front of the former hotel.
He said he would like to overhaul the site, and has only been allowing short-term leases.
“We’ve been in talks with politicians and we’re open to be a part of any development that goes on over there,” he said.
New bus routes and route extensions across New York City will start Sunday, August 31.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is making $4.
9 million in bus service improvements for 2014, targeting growing neighborhoods.
“New York City changes all the time, and we must keep up by making accommodations and adding service when the need arises,” stated Carmen Bianco, president of New York City Transit.
“We are committed to improving reliability and service for our customers in all five boroughs.
” For instance, Flushing, Queens and Manhattan’s Far West Side are two neighborhoods experiencing huge population growth, and extra stops have been added to existing lines in those areas.
All three routes will be extended to a new bus terminal at Gateway Center II (Gateway Center North) in the Spring Creek area of Brooklyn.
The route will be extended from Westchester Square to the end of Marconi Street by the 911 Call Center in the Hutchinson Metro Center.
The extension adds four eastbound stops and four westbound at the Metro Center.
The new service will accommodate customers along 11th and 12th Avenues between Abington Square in the West Village and Columbus Circle, an area that has been developing rapidly.
The northern terminal will be on West 58th Street at Broadway.
The southern terminal will be on Eighth Avenue at Jane Street.
The terminals for both routes in downtown Flushing will be relocated from Main Street between 39th Avenue and Roosevelt Avenue to 138th Street between 39th and 37th Avenues.
The Q113 local route will be restructured as the Q114 Limited to provide faster service to customers traveling a long distance along Guy R.
Brewer Boulevard in South Jamaica and Rochdale Village.
The new Q114 route will make limited stops on the Boulevard, then all local stops along Brookville Boulevard and through Woodmere, Cedarhurst, Inwood, Lawrence and Far Rockaway.
During overnight hours, it will make all local stops along Guy R.
The Q113 Limited will continue its limited-stop service from Jamaica through Far Rockaway, and the Q111 will continue to make all local stops from Jamaica through Rosedale.
Midday and evening service will be added to the limited-stop route that travels between Bay Ridge in Brooklyn and the College of Staten Island.
The Super Express concept is coming to Eltingville in Staten Island via the X21, which will travel to Midtown Manhattan along 42nd Street.
It will operate during morning and evening peak hours, making a limited number of stops and offering a faster commute for many customers of existing Staten Island express buses.
The terminal in Manhattan will be located on East 41 Street and First Avenue.
The Staten Island terminal will be located in the Hylan Boulevard bus loop on Richmond Avenue.

"Con il mio 25% Renzi sta governando.
Io non ci sono al governo, mi va bene, non chiedo riconoscenza ma rispetto".
Così l'ex segretario del Pd Pier Luigi Bersani a Dimartedì, in onda questa sera su La7.
L'ex segretario Pd non ha risparmiato affondi nei confronti del premier: "Dall'entourage di Renzi mi vogliono spiegare, a me, come si sta in un partito.
Ma vorrei chiedere: dove sta scritto nel programma di cancellare l'articolo 18.
"non è certamente un simbolo ma un suo aspetto simbolico sicuramente lo ha: non si può buttarlo via perché il lavoro non può essere inteso totalmente solo come salario ma è anche diritti e dignità delle persone.
Il lavoro, ha detto ancora Bersani, "si dà con gli investimenti e servono regole precise per l'occupazione".
Quindi Bersani ha ripreso, con ironia, uno degli slogan più famosi del premier: "Leggo che avrei chissà quale obiettivo, di stare lavorando per chissà quale piano.
A Renzi e agli altri dico, state sereni.
Sul Jobs Act infine ha messo in guardia su possibili alleanze con Forza Italia: "Si parla con tutti.
Ma la parola patto è troppo stretta.
Non c'è alcun motivo, nè politico nè numerico, per rivolgersi ad altri".
From the NY Times: The area with the most food stamp recipients in the city last year, 63,328 people, was Community Board 5 in Brooklyn, which includes the neighborhoods of Cypress Hills, East New York, New Lots and Starrett City.
The area with the fewest recipients, 2,312, was Community Board 1 in Manhattan, which covers most of the lower part of the island south of Canal Street.
Since 2001, several areas have had a startling increase in food stamp use, mirroring a national trend.
Community Board 13 in Queens, which includes Bellerose, Cambria Heights, Floral Park and Queens Village, has had a 205 percent jump in the number of recipients.
Nearby, Community Board 12, encompassing Hollis, St.
Albans and South Jamaica, has experienced a 184 percent rise.
No district in the city has had a drop in the number of people receiving benefits through the program.
PARIS — The new government approved Tuesday by President François Hollande squelched important voices of dissent on the left wing of his Socialist Party but signaled little change of direction on economic policies that critics say have left the French economy mired in stagnation.
The marginal changes, analysts said, mean that France, Europe’s second-largest economy, after Germany, could be in for a long slog, with consequences for both Mr.
Hollande’s already weak political standing and the wider European economy.
“He is changing the government without changing the direction of policy, which is a bad thing,” said Jean-Paul Fitoussi, a professor of economics at the Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris.
“We are in a world of uncertainty, and they need to be reactive to a dangerous new phenomenon that has appeared, which is stagnant growth.
” After publicly criticizing Mr.
Hollande’s economic policies, Arnaud Montebourg, France’s combative economy minister and a prominent voice of the left wing of the governing Socialist Party, was pushed out in the reshuffling — the second cabinet shake-up in six months.
Making clear that he and the president would brook little dissent, Prime Minister Manuel Valls kept a trusted lieutenant, Michel Sapin, a career politician and close friend of Mr.
And he named Emmanuel Macron, 36, a former investment banker at Rothschild and a deputy secretary general at the Élysée Palace who has been a close adviser to Mr.
Hollande on economic policies, as the new economy minister, replacing Mr.
Valls is seeking to ensure his party’s backing, he asked Parliament on Tuesday to hold a rare vote of confidence in the new government in September or October.
“The majority will have to be there,” he said of the vote in an interview on French television.
“If we don’t get a majority, it’s over — we cannot continue.
” Both men were expected to press ahead with Mr.
Hollande’s economic program, including a package of spending cuts totaling 50 billion euros, or $66 billion, through 2017, and a package of tax measures for employers designed to stoke hiring.
The moves appeared to trim the ideological breadth of the cabinet at the expense of the left.
But analysts expected that would do little to alter the course Mr.
Hollande has plotted in trying to keep his party with him while also appeasing European Union officials who want countries to mend their public finances by reducing budgets.
Hollande has tried to walk a line between the two camps, and watched his public standing dwindle.
His policies have stoked ire from both the left and from French businesses and international investors, who say he has not gone far enough to revive the nation’s competitiveness.
If nothing else, the crisis has made more apparent the competing forces that have tugged at Mr.
Hollande since the beginning of his term in 2012.
It has also highlighted the limited policy tools available to him in an atmosphere, in France and in much of the rest of Europe, of high public debt, persistent unemployment and stagnant growth that threatens to transform the five-year euro crisis into a chronic economic illness.
Analysts said they expected the new government to push ahead with more of Mr.
Hollande’s austerity measures, which were necessary to help reduce France’s deficit.
Critics say the measures have thwarted an economic recovery after nearly a year of stagnant growth and high unemployment, which hovers above 10 percent.
Politically, the early judgments on the reshuffling were gloomy as jockeying began for the next presidential elections in 2017, cementing Mr.
Hollande’s image as an ineffective politician who now faces the added risk of seeing his party base further erode.
Simon Tilford, an economist who is deputy director of the Center for European Reform, a research institute in London, said that the latest French political crisis would invariably also diminish Mr.
Hollande in Brussels in favor of Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel.
It was her insistence on austerity that helped spur the divisions that led to the French crisis.
“In terms of the way Hollande is perceived abroad, this will reinforce the perception that he is a weak leader who is unable to marshal his troops effectively,” Mr.
At home, the abruptness and upheaval caused by the crisis were a fresh blow to Mr.
Hollande at a time when his popularity ratings are already at record lows, and disillusioned voters show signs of defecting to other parties, including the far-right National Front.
Françoise Fressoz, an editorial writer for Le Monde, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday that the reshuffle showed a structural flaw within the Socialist Party.
“This is a crisis that shows the weakness of the left, its amateurism, its lack of preparation when faced with a crisis, and its inability to work together to collectively overcome it,” she wrote.
“There is not much authority left for the French president.
” While the prospect of change may rest with Mr.
Macron, both are close allies of Mr.
Hollande and are unlikely to voice much dissent.
The newspaper La Tribune called Mr.
Macron, who formerly worked at the French Treasury, “an anti-Montebourg” who was expected to “defend the official line.
” Known for a market-friendly approach, he played a significant role in advising Mr.
Hollande during his presidential campaign, promoting an economic policy based on supply and support to companies.
“He stands plainly for everything that Montebourg was opposed to,” Antonio Barroso, a senior vice president at the advisory firm Teneo Intelligence, said in a note to clients.
“His appointment will reduce the potential for dissonant opinions inside the government and help Valls to push ahead with his policy agenda.
” Like nearly every member of the French cabinet, Mr.
Sapin, who attended an elite French university with Mr.
Hollande, has never worked in business.
He is better versed in the nuances of European politics, having gotten his start in the early 1990s, when, as finance minister under President François Mitterrand, also a Socialist, he managed the referendum campaign to persuade the French to join in the creation of the euro.
Montebourg had warned that the austerity program would only suppress a recovery, others said it was important for the president to make some progress in curbing runaway government spending.
“Fifty billion in three years is massive for France, so it’s a positive sign that Mr.
Hollande is committed to continuing what he’s doing,” said Famke Krumbmüller, a Europe analyst at the Eurasia Group in London.
“The only alternative would be to do much less to please the left wing of his party.
Sapin has already warned France’s European partners that the government can no longer meet its deficit targets, and he is expected to continue pressing the European Union and Germany for more flexibility on fiscal rules.
Still, in an interview in July, Mr.
Sapin rejected the notion that France risked becoming the next sick man of Europe.
“We don’t see it like that,” he said.
“France is a huge economy in Europe, with an industrial base, innovation and research.
I don’t see how we can be sick — or at least sick for a long time.

If you have to call Double Duchess’ music anything, call it future-twerk with heart.
The electro-hop duo, made up of Krylon Superstar and davO, are creating a buzz with their video for their song “Good Girl Freak Out,” a throbbing, slick dance number that features Kelly Osbourne (as a reimagined Jem.
), strappy leather outfits, vogueing realness and hipster L.
Oh, and did we mention that it was directed by J.
, the gay filmmaker behind Spork.
Krylon and davO started making music in 2010, “inspired by their love for boys, being sassy, and the queer community in their new city of San Francisco.
” The first big break came from their gritty, street-savvy video for “Bucket Betch,” featured in their 2012 EP Hey Girl.
As members of the LGBTQ community, the San Francisco-based pair fuse their histories— Krylon as a New York club kid and performance artist, davO as a member of hip-hop/funk/punk Jepetto (“We were part of the Warped Tour a lot just out of high school.
”)—to create fun dance music everyone can party to.
Now working on a full-length that’s scheduled to come out in March 2015, Double Duchess like to say their music transcends gender and genres—and that’s true—but the duo have another agenda: to bring their music to the mainstream while being true to themselves.
Krylon: We met through common friends; we were in the same social circles in San Francisco.
When we formed a band, it was more along the lines of hanging out and the recognizing that we had similar musical taste.
We both liked underground house music and weird ‘90s college rock, so that sort of spawned our collaboration.
davO: In the beginning we were just playing around but [our music] ended up being a sound that was genuine to us as people and it was fun and high energy and translated into what it is and has grown since then.
I’m really interested in what you were listening to when you wrote “Good Girl Freak Out” because there’s a lot going on there.
D: When I started that track I was into Big Freedia, a kind of larger-than-life sound, which is why the beats have that kind of feel.
D: Kry and I have this dance test: If we’re writing a track, and it has an energy and we're vibing and moving around, then it becomes something we use because that's how our shows are and we both know we can exist in the track and both be really happy with it.
Your videos are a visual feast.
K: I am a fashionista and a visionary when it comes to fashion, and we made an arrangement where davO is really into the musical aspect of Double Duchess and I'm more the visual/fashion aspect of the band.
At the end of the day, we both collaborate on the music and the fashion, but we each have a focus.
D: Krylon creates our look for us, except in “Good Girl Freak Out,” where we had stylists.
K: We try to be current as far as what is fashionably happening around us, but also we want to be visionaries in going forward with what's happening artistically.
With us it's about expressing our inner queerness in an outward way.
I know you’re really huge in the LGBT community—is going mainstream a big goal for you.
D: What’s important is that if we can keep our integrity as openly queer people and not ever feel like we're having to silence the things that we want to say or do; if that can exist in a mainstream level then we are OK with that.
Essentially the queer community gives people a lot of strength.
The idea is to broaden the mainstream wide enough so that everyone can feel like they have a place in it.
K: I think the queer community is embracing us and uplifting us to want to deliver a positive imagery to the world.
[Being in Double Duchess] is such an amazing outlet to have the queer voice heard and moving into a more mainstream crowd… I think mainstream is ready for us.
That's why the queer community is getting looked at as far as hip-hop and other types of music goes.
We’re moving into the mainstream with a positive message and representing the community in a positive way.
People are going to see that we're two queer guys—there's no avoiding that.
But what we have to offer and how we translate is up to us.
And we're doing that in a positive and creative way.
How did Future People get involved in “Good Girl Freak Out”.
D: Dan Marcellus, Chris Cosgrove and I were in a band called Jepetto; I've known Chris since I was 5, actually.
We grew up in Maryland and toured as a band together throughout high school.
Chris and I actually moved to the West Coast together, to San Francisco.
Speaking of collaborators, Kelly Osbourne looks fabulous in your video.
K: Kelly hairstylist Johnny Dunn is a really good friend of ours, and when we went to go play at the Arts Center in LA, he came to see us perform and he loved us.
At the same time, JD—who directed “Good Girl Freak Out”—is also good friends with Kelly and so he asked her if she’d be into the video and she said yes.
D: She kind of oversees the scenario of the song; she has a big role because she she looks great.
There's been talks of playing Kelly's birthday party in October, I really hope that happens.
D: We don't have a booking agent or management or anything like that; we do a lot of stuff on our own.
The goal is to get our name out there enough to where people can work with us and have a lot of people see us.
Hopefully “Good Girl Freak Out” is the one that gets us calls.
A lot of people just assume we're on a label or we have an agency.
At some point it will be really nice to get those offers because it will make it easier for us to take time to write music.
In October we’re hosting a Kickstarter to help us launch our full-length album.
If you were to write a Double Duchess manifesto what would be in it.
K: We're not about egos, we're not too cool for school.
We're not about getting big so we can feel like that.
I think we both just want to send out really good energy out [via] fun music.
We want to travel and pay our bills, but be really happy with what we're putting out in the world first and foremost.
D: And be humble as who we are as people.
K: I would love to play a concert in an island with Missy Elliott and Radiohead; some huge festival for a whole bunch of people with really huge acts, but admission would be free.
Like it was to support some research that would cure people, you know what I mean.

From the NY Times: Larry Yang, the Korean-American owner of a hardware store next door, said he resented such a public promotion of same-sex marriage.
He said many among the large number of Korean-American Christians in Queens felt similarly but feared that if they spoke out they would be demonized by a liberal majority.
The legalization of same-sex marriage in New York State has been embraced by many in the city.
But in some neighborhoods heavily populated by immigrants from countries where homosexuality is less accepted, the idea is stirring feelings of unease or, at times, outright disgust.
Sunnyside has been transformed in recent decades, first by immigration, and more recently by urban professionals priced out of Manhattan.
As in some other parts of the city, same-sex marriage has laid bare the clash between the social conservatism of many immigrants and the values of the often wealthier and more liberal newcomers to the neighborhood.
Many immigrants in Sunnyside are Muslims from Turkey, where the military, the guardian of the country’s secular state, regards homosexuality as a disorder.
On a recent day on 46th Street, a group of men hunched over Turkish newspapers next to a mosque in a part of the neighborhood that includes kebab shops, a Jewish community center, a Romanian restaurant and a Russian hairdresser.
In Flushing, Queens, one of New York’s most polyglot neighborhoods, with one of the largest Asian communities in the country, opponents of same-sex marriage said they had felt sidelined during the debate over it.
Yang, the hardware store owner, dismissed the free wedding reception as a cynical ploy.
“It’s a business thing, because a lot of gay people live here,” he said.
“I have no problem with my gay customers.
No one says, ‘This gay marriage is a good thing.
’ What is this world coming to.

The Songs Remain the Same, Just Played a Little Slower In its first full concert since 1980, Led Zeppelin performed in tempos more graceful than those on its old live recordings.
The press agent in London was getting the same question all day: Which finger was it.
Led Zeppelin to Make Its Songs Available Digitally The band’s decision to sell its music online coincides with the end of a fierce bidding war over the rights to administer the band’s catalog of songs.
Songs That Evoke Both Age and Eternal Youth Catharsis was always the punch line in Led Zeppelin's big show.
The band crashed through the self-imposed limits of the blues form using the grandiose gestures of opera.

Getting the Led Out of Led Zeppelin In the 1970's, Led Zeppelin added "heavy" to the lexicon of adjectives used to describe rock music, developed a reputation for wild, destructive hotel parties, raked in larger percentages of profits than any band before it and turned an uncompromisingly long song, the eight-minute "Stairway to Heaven," into the most popular tune on radio.

Hey, don't fret that you can't afford to buy a house (or really even rent), normal folk, living in a giant mansion totally sucks, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Installing a WiFi network is a real bitch (and sometimes you even need a separate one for your staff, "for security purposes") and then you can't exactly take care of the whole place yourself, so you're forced to hire all kinds of managers and maids and gardeners—complete strangers who are not rich and yet there they are, tramping through your domain every day.
Sounds like a nightmare, right.
Well, one rich guy in Rolling Hills finally decided to do something about it.
Blazevich spent 17 years building a 51,000-square-foot house in the gated 'hood; it sits mostly underground due to height restrictions and has 25 bathrooms with hand-cut tile floors, a five-story indoor tennis court, a 10,000-square-foot hammam, and custom gold-leaf work that took an artist 10 years to produce.
When it was finally finished, he had no choice but to bring in "a huge staff, including a property manager, an administrative assistant, five gardeners and three maids.
On Friday night, a comedian named Ari Teman rented out his Manhattan apartment on Airbnb to a man named David who said he was looking for a place for his family to stay while in New York for a wedding.
What Teman accidentally discovered later was that his apartment was being prepared to host an orgy.
According to Teman, he handed the keys over to David late Friday afternoon.
Then, he left his suitcase with his doorman and went to dinner before planning to head out of New York.
When Teman returned to his building to retrieve his bag, he saw David in the lobby and overheard him telling others that "they're shutting us down.
" Teman asked what was being "shut down," which he said brought a look of mortified recognition over David's face.
Concerned and suspicious, Teman went back upstairs to his apartment, where he attempted to figure out what was going on.
He opened his computer and Googled the Gmail address and phone number David had provided him during their correspondence on Airbnb.
The search of the phone number brought up this tweet from February that advertised a "BBW Panty Raid Party" in New York.
From there, Teman discovered the Twitter feed of @TWINN_GREEN, who was advertising a "XXX Freak Fest" on Friday night at the location of Teman's building.
By that point, Teman had also already noticed damage to his furniture — some of which had been overturned — and musical equipment, as well as bags of condoms and liquor lying around that he said weren't his.
Cops from the NYPD's 10th precinct were eventually called to clear the apartment.
When reached at the number listed in Munch Da Mouth's tweet, a man who identified himself as "David" insisted that he did nothing wrong.
According to David, his rental agreement with Teman stated that he could have up to 50 guests (a claim Teman disputes), but he denies that he was having a party, anyway.
"I'm in no way, shape or form worried about this particular situation," David told me.
But David did confirm that he had agreed to rent the apartment from Teman, and he did answer the phone connected to the number advertising the "XXX Freak Fest" at Teman's building.
Teman said he's now in a discussion with his landlord over the future of the apartment, for which he has retained an attorney.
But this isn't really a story about Ari Teman, David, or New York's XXX Freak Fests.
And it's not really about our brave, new, tech-driven world — in which we can stay at strangers' apartments, catch rides in their cars, or merely shit in their toilets with a few taps of our phones — either.
To its credit, Airbnb's response to Teman was quick, almost absurdly so.
Within 24 hours, per an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change his locks, made plans to put him up in a hotel for a week, and wired him $23,817 (of which Airbnb itself is insured, but nonetheless).
Airbnb has apparently learned from its mistakes, which included hostile reactions from company backers to a woman whose apartment was pillaged by an Airbnb renter in 2011.
Really, this is (yet another) story about the power of social media in our everyday lives, just with a twist of BBW orgy.
Had Teman Googled David's phone number before handing over the keys, he probably would have cancelled the agreement and saved everyone the trouble.
If David's number wasn't plastered across Twitter, he and whomever wanted to pay $20 to enter his party could have fucked all over Teman's apartment in peace.
Instead, Teman ended up stuck in New York and displaced from his apartment.
David did not get to throw his Freak Fest.
They both have spent the past 48 hours entangled with lawyers and policemen.
What a weekend it could have been.
UPDATE: Gawker has received the following statement from Airbnb: Over 11 million guests have had a safe and positive experience on Airbnb and problems for hosts and guests are incredibly rare, but when they happen, we try to help make things right.
We were appalled when we learned about this incident and we took immediate action to help this host.
The individual who rented this space has been permanently removed from our site.
We've reimbursed the host for damages to his apartment and ensured he has a new place to stay.
In the days ahead, we'll continue to work with the host to assist him with his additional needs and we will work cooperatively with any law enforcement agencies that investigate this matter.

“Throwing things,” is currently liveblogging the national spelling bee.
It’s a really an enthralling read, if for no other reason than they have a former national finalist among their cohort of live bloggers (Shonda Rhimes -creator of Grey’s Anatomy), as well as a bunch of finalists and possibly a former winner commenting on the site.
It may be the only blog on the planet where you can read sentences like: The spelling wheat has been separated from this year’s chaff, and Round 3 has begun, with 286 spellers now reduced to 107.
, 106, as the fear of poisons, TAHKS-uh-FO-bee-uh, has infected one of the spellers.
FIRST THING WE DO, LET’S KILL ALL THE LAWYERS: If there is a villain in this first two-thirds of the second round of the Bee, it is the evil lawyer.
Contestants have been dismissed, summarily adjudged, vacated, and remanded to the crying room with such every-day lawyer parlance as “privilege,” “notarize,” “concede,” “debtor,” and “felony,” each of which I have used in a brief in the last six months and Sports Center doesn’t can’t top this type of commentary I’m glad this round isn’t on TV, because it makes the kids empty vessels into which we can hypothesize a personality and backstory to match their geography, sponsorship, and the words with which they will forever be associated.

What’s absolutely stunning about the continuing fascination with “multiple provider” models of outsourcing public schools to private management is the obliviousness of its leading adherents to the disastrous results in the two major urban school districts — New Orleans and Philadelphia — where the model has been tried.
In the past, Edwize has pointed out major studies highlighting the failures of both experiments, here and here.
This week’s news brings to light yet another exposé of the failures in Philadelphia — this time an internal district study that Philadelphia school district head Paul Vallas had done his best to deep six, as it had concluded that the district should pull the plug on the contracts with every one of the six private EMOs.
The intrepid Philadelphia Public School Notebook published the report on its website, and the Philadelphia Inquirer reported on its details.
The AFT’s NCLBlog reports on it here.
Vallas is now triumphantly heading off to New Orleans, as if he was a conquering hero.
He seems to have become the Sanjaya Malakar of American education — you watch his performance, and you’re damned if you can figure out what people see in him.
Where is Simon Cowell now that we need him.
The Sunday Magazine of the New York Times has an interesting essay, “Standardizing the Standards,” which discusses the problems in acquiring meaningful data on student learning from the high stakes tests used by various states under NCLB.
If the state standardized tests are to be believed, 71% of Florida schools and 4% of Wisconsin schools are failing to make the No Child Left Behind Annual Yearly Progress [AYP] benchmarks.
In the face of such incredulous results, author Ann Hulbert invokes Campbell’s Law to explain the manipulations, deliberate and otherwise, of performance data.
Campbell, a social psychologist, posited in 1975 that “the more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor.
” Hulbert notes that making NAEP into a national high stakes test could eliminate the incredulous differences in reports of student proficiency among the states, but insofar as it too would be subject to Campbell’s law, distortions and corruptions currently absent from that exam would appear.
One of the reasons why NAEP data is one of the more accurate measures of learning now available, for example, is that there is no ‘test preparation’ for it, and that would change overnight if it were to become a hig stakes exam.
With Campbell’s Law in mind, we thought that it might be time to fashion a new law — the Education CEO law — to describe what happens when non-educators take over the management of schools and school districts, a phenomenon which is unfortunately on the wax and not the wane.
The less actual classroom and school experience a person in school management has, we have learned, the less likely they are to see a need for such experience and the more apt they are to disregard the advice of experienced educators in making policy decisions.
The most bone-headed mistakes we have seen invariably come from those with the least educational experience — and no desire to listen to those who do possess such experience.
In the “give credit where credit is due” department, it was refreshing to see Checker Finn relate the virtues of experience working with real teachers in real schools.
“It’s been healthy to emerge from the ivory tower,” Finn wrote in his weekly Gadfly on his Fordham Institute’s experience as a charter authorizer in Ohio, “to work closely with real educators trying to do right by real children — almost all of them poor, minority, and ill-served by traditional schools — in real places.
” In a piece worth reading, Finn relates a number of things that experience have taught them, including that It’s far harder than theorists thought to actually close a mediocre (or even bad) school.
I plead guilty to having helped to propagate a naïve doctrine here.
Unless its students face imminent danger or someone has fled to Bermuda with the payroll, shuttering a school is a tricky business.
Parents and kids usually like their school, no matter its low test scores and torpid curriculum, and don’t want it closed any more than do the clients of a surplus district school.
There is an interesting exchange on Fred Klonsky’s blog, as a discussion of the Green Dot charters becomes an occasion for discussing what’s ‘public’ and what’s ‘private’ in education, and teacher union stratagies and approaches to charter schools and small schools.
Fred is the president of an Illinois NEA local.
[You have to read the comments to really appreciate the dialogue.
] Having taken a ‘blood oath’ that we would respond only to substantive discussions of the ‘Green Dot tenure’ issue, it was a welcome development that today Eduwonk’s Andy Rotherham addressed the question of whether the term ‘tenure’ was a useful point of departure for a discussion.
There are some not insignificant points of agreement between us: the real question is whether Green Dot teachers have due process rights against arbitrary and unreasonable discipline and dismissal, whatever term is used to describe it.
Where we still disagree is that Andy seems to think that Green Dot’s ‘just cause’ standard and a grievance process that culminates with a hearing before an impartial arbitrator is a level of protection less than tenure.
We don’t see that, and we have yet to see anyone even try to explain how that is the case.
If anything, the Green Dot contract offers greater protection, since it covers all employees, where tenure protections do not cover probationary employees in their first years of service.
Quite frankly, the public discourse around tenure and the actual real world of tenure rights are two very different things, in no small part because those who seek ‘at will’ standards of employment have a vested interest in promoting the idea that ‘tenure’ keeps school districts from dismissing teachers who are not doing their work.
Every principal has now selected a School Support Organization: either one of the four theme-based organizations headed by current regional superintendents, Empowerment or one of the Partnership Support Organizations (PSO).
None of these organizations will rate/evaluate/hire or fire supervisors – that will be the role of the newly selected thirty-two community superintendents and the nine high school superintendents.
Many are currently local instructional superintendents with close ties to their districts.
In the online registration process the principal “certifies” that s/he consulted with the School Leadership Team.
At the May 9th Delegate Assembly a delegate asked “Who has the final decision.
” The DOE rep answered “The principal,” and some in the audience jeered.
The creation of School Leadership Teams required that the Chapter Leader serve on the Team, however, while the Chapter Leader, and other teacher members may participate in discussions the “last word” is that of the Principal.
The C-30 process has always been a charade.
Teachers participated in the process but ultimately the decision was that of the principal or the superintendent.
Does participating in the selection of your boss tie you to the decision.
In reality, schools with close relationships with Parent Associations have substantial impact on the process.
Mirroring on the local level what the union is achieving on the City level.
In Europe it is commonplace for unions to have positions on corporate Boards of Directors – the system is called codetermination.
The entire question of consultation, consensus, and shared decision making are significant issues.
One of the key characteristics of effective schools is collaboration: between the principal and the staff and among staff members.
In some schools the principals and the teachers are a team — interaction and collaboration are core premises.
In too many schools all decisions are made in isolation by the principal.
These schools are “factory model” schools, and, frequently, the product is less than the sum of the parts.
Would a “co-detemination” model work on the central School Board or local School Boards.
Are Chapter sign offs empowering or obstructing.
As the current Mayoral control legislation moves towards sunset the question of what should replace it is both complex and crucial.
MsB is the pseudonym for a second-year high school English teacher in Brooklyn.
The thought of next year scares me.
All we talk about are the changes that are going to be made.
Naturally, there is always room for improvement.
The current educational system isn’t exactly flawless.
The more experienced teachers shrug off the worries about next year.
They’ve seen a million changes in the education system.
For me, a newer teacher, I am shaking in my newly pressed teacher pants.
What will this do to our school.
Again, people don’t seem alarmed.
No teacher believes that it will affect their teaching at all.
The thought of other companies giving us curriculum and deciding what we will teach isn’t scary.
Will the changes in administration trickle down and affect our teaching.
There are many options that each school can take.
Right now, my school is leaning towards Empowerment.
The language these politicians use always amuses me.
They are dangling the thought of freedom over our heads, but really there is nothing empowering about it.
If we fail with this newfound freedom, which many schools will, there is the threat of being closed down like so many of our neighboring schools.
Our principal assumes if we form a network with similar schools, we can band together and change the world.
Our principal wants us to join the best schools in my borough.
My thoughts are that they won’t want us in their network.
We are by far not one of the best schools in Brooklyn.
We will surely only hold them down.
And once we have a network, then what.
See who in our network has the largest suspension center.
Compare broken-down classrooms.
Share our one working overhead projector.
As far as individual teachers are concerned, there is talk about how each teacher will be graded.
There are plenty of rumors going around about how the schools have to account for the progress of every single student.
Each student will have their own barcode (we all knew this was only a matter of time), and they will measure how much they progress and how much they learned.
If your students don’t seem to have improved, then that teacher gets a bad grade.
I have 170 students that I teach on a daily basis.
Can I improve all of their ability to think.
Maybe, but that’s not what I’m being graded on.
Can I get them all to pass a test.
Maybe not, but that is what matters in the end.
Is it wrong that all I want to do is teach.
These tests get in the way of that.
Teaching towards a test does not actually involve teaching.
When you are preparing for a state exam, it’s explaining a formula to the kids.
If you do A, B and C, you will pass.
Instead, we should be focusing on thinking.
We should be wondering how we can get our students to think critically about the world.
There is already too much on our plates.
We have to teach Regents prep, novels, poems, stories, writing, vocabulary, spelling, grammar, PSAT prep and more Regents prep.
Therefore, we must be creative in our teaching methods.
I hate to be so negative, but in all of the conversations about the changes, no one ever seems to be thinking about what is best for the children.
I understand that there needs to be some standard by which we can assess our children, but aren’t there other ways of doing this.
In my two years of teaching, I never once thought my job was in jeopardy.
But soon, I fear, tenure will be a thing of the past, no one will be safe, and the youth that are the future of our country will grow up to be great robots that can fill out a bubble sheet with their eyes closed and one hand behind their backs.
Barr, founder and director of the unionized Green Dot Charter Schools in Los Angeles, is meeting with UFT President Randi Weingarten later today, and so he has been drawn into the evidence free vortex that surrounds discussion of teacher unions in certain quarters of the blogosphere.
From the “make up whatever facts fit today’s rant” school of thought, there is the assertion that Barr has thrown tenure out the window.
Ed Sector boss Andy Rotherham adds his two cents, that throwing out tenure is a good thing.
Someone might take the trouble to read the Green Dot contract, and compare it what is done in non-union charter schools, including those which Rotherham faithfully promotes in his capacity as a board member of the union-busting New York Charter School Association.
The management of anti-union charter schools insist that the only acceptable standard of employment is “at-will employment,” under which an employee can be dismissed at any time for any reason whatsoever – good, bad or indifferent.
Such a standard comes in handy when anti-union charter school managements want to fire teachers for such high crimes and misdemeanors as sharing with their colleagues information on salaries in district public schools and supporting their student’s desire to read a poem about Emmett Till during Black History Month.
[At-will employment was a common law creation of American state courts at the end of the 19th century when the economic doctrine of laissez-faire capitalism was being read into the Constitution and law, with courts striking down child labor laws, minimum wage laws and laws restricting the length of the work day and week as violations of the 5th and 14th amendment rights to property.
] In unionized schools, the prevailing standard is just cause – there must be a good reason, such as the malfeasance in the performance of one’s job, for an employee to be dismissed.
This is the general standard used in workplaces with union representation and in the civil service.
Under the just cause standard, there are due process appeals for employees who believe that they have been dismissed without a good reason.
Tenure is the right to due process, under a just cause standard and before an impartial hearing body, when one is dismissed; it is granted after a period of probation during which the bearer of the right has demonstrated a mastery of the job.
Since tenure is a protection of academic freedom which pre-dates collective bargaining in public education, it is generally written into education law.
Charter laws and education laws vary from state to state, but most jurisdictions [such as California and New York] do not include charter school teachers in the legal protections of the right of tenure.
Consequently, unionized charter schools have to establish their own parallel system of due process for the protection of educator rights.
The Green Dot contract does precisely that.
Article XVIII of the Green Dot contract reads: “No unit member shall be disciplined, non-renewed, dismissed, reduce in rank or compensation without just cause.
” Article XIV lays out a procedure for complaints and grievances that culminates in a hearing before an independent arbitrator with the power to make decisions binding on the school management.
But why let the facts get in the way of a good rant.
Over at the AFT’s NCLBlog, Ed Muir muses on the notorious case of that Paul Whatshisname who couldn’t be fired because of that … He left his last job in disgrace, and he barely lasted a few months before leaving this one, so why couldn’t he be fired.
In any case, since he resigned rather than being fired, this must be further proof that the system can’t fire … or World Bank Presidents working under an “at will” contract.
Regarding Comment One, this case is an object lesson on why it is a good idea to actually read documents like contracts before one attacks them on one’s blog.
California charter school teachers start outside of the legal protections of tenure.
The California Teachers Association local in the Green Dot Charter Schools negotiated a contract with the two essential elements of a tenure system: [a] a just cause standard, and [b] due process before an impartial arbitrator.
So what exactly don’t they have in terms of protection, in substantive terms, other than the law — which is not something you negotiate over a bargaining table.
It appears that the worst that can be said about their agreement, and their willingness to call it by a name other than tenure, is that it leaves them open to uninformed attacks in the blogosphere.
For educators who are under state tenure laws, the law — and thus the name — are important, because the law provides protection beyond the collective bargaining agreement.
But for those who are not, it would seem rather straightforward that what they would want and need in their collective bargaining agreements would be a just cause standard and due process before an impartial arbitrator.
BTW, this is hardly unprecedented.
Educators in most private post-secondary institutions have tenure of this very type, and in many cases, without it ever being memorialized in a collective bargaining agreement.
The British liberal political philosopher Isaiah Berlin is famous for applying the moral of an ancient Greek fable to the study of different thinkers.
Using the moral of the poet Archilochus’ fable that “the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing,” Berlin argued that thinkers could be divided up among foxes and hedgehogs.
Foxes are thinkers that revel in the complexity of the world, finding a multitude of complicated causal relationships at work, while hedgehogs focus in on one central aspect of the world, which is then seen as determinative of all the rest of reality.
Aristotle’s Politics and Weberian sociology fit the paradigm of the intellectual fox, while Plato’s Republic and Marxian class struggle are striking exemplars of a hedgehog mind at work.
If there is an intellectual hedgehog in the world of educational policy, it is Education Trust.
While many education organizations and advocates share with Ed Trust a welcome focus on the achievement gap, none comes close to the single-mindedness it brings to the issue.
In a nation where the promise of Brown v.
Board of Education remains tragically unfulfilled, there is something deeply admirable and praiseworthy about a laser like focus on the achievement gap.
We need more – not less – of that focus, and more of the moral outrage against the radical inequalities – educational, economic and social – which give rise to the gap.
But the single-mindedness of Ed Trust is its weakness as well as its strength, its vice as well as its virtue.
Its analysis of the causes of the achievement gap and its proposals for closing that gap are hedgehog reductionist in the extreme.
With extraordinary conviction and rhetorical force, it insists that for educators, there is one, and only one, royal path to battle against the achievement gap – a singular focus on the failures of educational institutions and individual educators.
Any educational discussion of the many economic and social conditions that give rise to the achievement gap is tantamount to a craven surrender to the achievement gap and to injustice; it is an acceptance of the dishonorable precept that “demography is destiny.
” Consequently, aspersions are cast on the intentions of those educators and advocates who argue that a meaningful effort to close the achievement gap must include programs which address economic and social inequality as well as educational failure and malpractice.
Writing in September 2005 for Checker Finn’s Gadfly under the title “No Surrender,” Ed Trust’s Amy Wilkins put it this way: Faced with damage that racism and poverty inflict, too many educators have simply given in and given up on these children, insisting that as much as they care about these kids, they are powerless to change their life chances until someone else acts to improve the conditions of their families and their communities.
And they back up these claims and their inaction with quotes from people like Messrs Mishel and Rothstein.
In a very real sense these educators—with rhetorical support from Mishel and Rothstein—have surrendered to racism and poverty.
And in doing so they have surrendered their students to dim future at the cold and lonely margins of our economic and cultural mainstream.
Let us put to the side the caricature and distortion of Rothstein’s and Mishel’s arguments.
What Wilkins does in this essay is substitute a broad characterization of their imputed motivations and of the purported effects of their arguments for an actual discussion of any of their particular points.
Wilkins’ essay is a rhetorical, not a logical or evidence based, rejoinder: it is designed to dismiss rather than to engage.
It ill-serves any intellectual endeavor dedicated to understanding how to overcome racism and poverty – and the debates around the achievement gap are just such an endeavor – to cast about so loosely sweeping accusations of “surrender” to what all agree is the enemy.
That is the point at which righteousness in a just struggle, overtaken by hedgehog certitude about the absolute correctness of one’s central idea, passes over into self-righteousness.
A recent Ed Trust press release provided a remarkable window into just how total an ‘idea hedgehog’ the organization had become.
The subject was Education Week’s annual analysis of the state of American education, Quality Counts 2007.
What inspired such an intervention.
After a number of anecdotal complaints about academics who produce “endless tables on the percent of local babies born at low birth weight, those born to undereducated moms, those living in families getting public assistance, and so on down the line,” Ed Trust accused Education Week of becoming “Sociology Week.
” It had succumbed to the unpardonable intellectual crime of including data about the economic and social conditions which set the context of “chances for success.
” This, Ed Trust opined, sent a message to states and school districts that “if you have large numbers of poor or undereducated adults, just forget it.
” One might reasonably conclude that insofar as including data about students’ “chances for success” in a study of American schools sent any message, it would be that a meaningful assault on the achievement gap would require a comprehensive approach that addressed issues such as low birth weight along with school reform.
The fact that educators can not undo, but only ameliorate, the damage of low birth weight is no reason to ignore its very real negative impact on educational achievement.
While Ed Trust’s press release assures us that “in a country as rich as ours, it is an outrage that we allow so many children to live in poverty or grow up with inadequate health care,” their need to publicly declare their opposition to the inclusion of such issues in the foremost analysis of the state of American education belies their own words.
It is especially disturbing that this press release was directed not at an argument with which one might agree or disagree, but at the information provided in one of the leading national compilations of educational data.
This is an attempt at restricting the free flow of the widest possible set of data, a stab at the ideological policing of the boundaries of acceptable discourse on matters educational by eliminating inconvenient information.
While those opposed on principle to government anti-poverty programs and universal health care coverage may take succor from the exclusion of such issues from a discussion of the achievement gap in education, those of us who care deeply about advancing the education – and general well-being – of America’s poorest and most disadvantaged youth can only shudder at the thought of such a truncated and impoverished debate.
The cunning of the fox is required, if we are to make meaningful progress in diminishing the achievement gap.
From the moment I settled in for my eight-minute subway ride to school this morning until I plopped down for my eight-minute subway ride home, I was consumed with a certain feeling… dread, disgust, disappointment… I couldn’t really pinpoint it.
Do I dislike the neighborhood I teach in.
Am I frustrated with administration.
Are my kindergarten students sending me over the edge.
Is it a first-year teaching thing.
Okay, okay, I am terrible for giving up already.
Attempting to put this year into perspective, I have been thinking back to my freshman year of college.
First year living on my own, meeting strange individuals with peculiar habits, making independent choices.
no lie, after the first week I wanted to call it quits.
I felt out of place, quite lost and was struggling under the unfamiliar pressures of difficult classes.
That being said, by second semester I had found my niche.
Five years down the line, I was sad to move along.
Shouldn’t teaching follow the same pattern.
I figured my first year of teaching would suck.
Struggling to teach small beings who are constantly testing my limits, attempting to cooperate with parents who believe their five-year-old angel would never fight without being provoked (surely not.
), and giving up a great deal of dignity as I put on a quite a show to capture the attention of my children (a little song and dance always clears the air of chit-chat).
Clearly I was not wrong; teaching is tough.
But come now, I thought I would be getting good at teaching and that by May, by MAY for crying out loud, I would have my class running smoothly and under control.
Evidently this is not the case.
Am I willing to take that risk.
Should I open a bakery instead.
No matter my level of exasperation, no matter how much I’d like to close my eyes and wish my students away, my students will still be there when I open my eyes and I had better have a plan – a good plan – to get through each day without losing my mind.
I will keep thinking of ways to entice my children with finger puppets who just happen to love to read and will continue to attract their attention with a store full of goodies that five-year olds will do anything for in order to learn how money works.
I am striving to end the year in good spirits, striving to keep my head above the water.

The fledgling political activists, ages 10 to 81, crowded into Donnie Whitehead’s remodeled backyard garage in St.
Albans, Queens, for the first time since their crushing loss.
They talked about ways to move forward — educating voters, starting block associations — but it all sounded small, somehow, compared with the last grand battle.
, the visitor they had awaited with a mix of distaste and curiosity, Tim James, slid open the screen door.
James, a State Senate staff member on leave to work on the Democratic mayoral campaign, was an emissary from the political establishment that had just defeated them.
Their long-shot campaign had given the party machine “a run for the money,” he said.
Then he cajoled them to stump for the city comptroller, William C.
Thompson, himself an underdog against Mayor Michael R.
Bloomberg, needed their kind of energy.
Whitehead, 63, an unofficial neighborhood leader who had marshaled the group behind Clyde Vanel’s upstart campaign against Councilman Leroy G.
, played hard to get — “I answer to the grass-roots machine,” he said — but finally urged his volunteers to agree.
Thompson, but his central issue was the same as Mr.
Vanel’s: outrage at the City Council’s vote to change the term limits law and allow the mayor to run for a third term.
” It was a moment of reckoning for the volunteers, energized by Barack Obama’s campaign, then inspired to challenge their powerful city councilman and — like many Obama campaigners across the country — hoping to harness the momentum of 2008 to fix problems closer to home.
Now, a week after a disappointing defeat, they were sorting out how to keep their movement alive without the glamour of a David-and-Goliath contest.
Whitehead gently signaled, their work would be humble, gradual, more likely to deal in shades of gray.
The compromise was hard for some of the new activists to swallow.
“I am so not convinced,” said Monay Vick, 36.
If you don’t believe something, how do you convince someone else.
” When he threw his weight behind Mr.
Vanel, 35, a lawyer who challenged Mr.
Comrie, 51, a two-term councilman, Mr.
Whitehead had gambled that thousands of new voters who had registered for the Obama campaign would tip the balance in a Democratic primary usually decided by a few thousand party regulars.
Going door to door, his volunteers drew warm responses from people who said that incumbents too often catered to the neighborhood’s political insiders.
But as the polls closed on Sept.
15, red-eyed Vanel volunteers absorbed the preliminary results: Mr.
Comrie, 62 percent, amid a record low turnout citywide.
“So much for the Obama effect,” said Rance Huff, Mr.
Comrie had just declared victory at the Guy R.
Brewer United Democratic Club, the headquarters of the Queens party establishment, where paid campaigners, impatient for their cash, raised such a ruckus that someone called the police.
Comrie’s staff members acknowledged that the challengers had forced them to campaign harder than ever before — and that in the process, they had gotten such an earful that the councilman planned to overhaul the way he communicated with the public.
“I was not happy with the level of reaction I got from people who felt they didn’t have a connection to the office,” Mr.
Some, he said, had asked for help and had been disappointed, but many more simply knew little about their councilman.
The campaign seemed to remind some people about him.
His staff believes it roughly doubled attendance at his office’s foreclosure-counseling seminars.
Vanel got a few calls from people reporting, say, illegal car-repair shops.
They thought he was the councilman.
The race even roused Archie Spigner, 81, the area’s political éminence grise who was elected its councilman in 1974 and served until 2002, when Mr.
Comrie, his protégé, succeeded him.
Spigner now concedes that the Brewer club needs to bring in a new generation, though he is not sure how to find young people who care about politics.
“I haven’t found them — maybe Mr.
” As tickled as he was to have shaken things up, Mr.
Whitehead, a retired subway station manager, had hoped for something more dramatic.
The Obama campaign electrified southeast Queens, the heart of middle-class black New York, even though elected officials there followed party orders and backed Hillary Rodham Clinton in the primary.
Whitehead, who had helped build grass-roots support for Mr.
Obama, thought that voters’ next step might be to throw some of those officials out.
But it seems the new Obama voters did not show up this time, said John Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York.
The number of new voters who cast ballots in September is not yet public, but there is a clear indicator: While 339,000 first-time voters cast ballots in November 2008, last month about 370,000 New Yorkers voted — total.
Mollenkopf said an Obama effect might yet materialize.
Nearly half a million New York voters who registered in 2008 “are still out there” to be tapped, he said, and despite low turnout — which he blamed on the lackluster mayor’s race — council members faced more primary challengers than usual, and four lost, the most in decades.
“That augurs well for democracy,” Mr.

Malcolm Smith (D-Hollis) was absent in Albany more than all his colleagues in the chamber, except for Sen.
Adriano Espaillat (D-Washington Heights), who was mounting an unsuccessful bid for Congress.
But Smith was among the Senate’s top 10 drafters of resolutions adopted by both houses, the New York Public Interest Research Group’s review of the 2014 state legislative session found.
NYPIRG, a nonpartisan good government group, compiled an analysis of this year’s action in Albany.
The report found lawmakers have sent fewer bills to Gov.
Andrew Cuomo’s desk than any state executive has received in the past century.
NYPIRG hypothesized legislating has grown abbreviated as state budgets have become lengthier and more complex.
It also said the slim majority the parties that have controlled the Senate have had in recent years may present a barrier to bills.
Besides examining legislative action, NYPIRG tabulated state Assembly members’ and senators’ attendance rates and voting records as well as how much lawmakers spoke on the floor.
Smith was among seven senators who were absent and excused from at least 100 votes in 2014, NYPIRG’s report said.
Smith, who spent part of the session on trial in a federal corruption case, missed 808 votes.
This put him directly behind Espaillat, an uptown Manhattan congressional hopeful who was not present during 891 votes.
Smith’s office said they believed his absences all occurred when he was in federal court and on trial for allegedly attempting to bribe his way onto the Republican line in the 2013 mayoral election.
In the Assembly, NYPIRG said four Queens lawmakers were among 18 who missed at least 150 votes, including Assembly members Aravella Simotas (D-Astoria) with 275 excuses or absences; Andrew Hevesi (D-Forest Hills) with 264; Margaret Markey (D-Maspeth) with 172; and William Scarborough (D-Jamaica) with 168.
Scarborough said he missed many votes on the final day of session because he was told it would end hours before voting wrapped up.
At that point, he drove back to the city for a meeting with a city commissioner that it took months to schedule.
The other Assembly members cited personal matters — Markey had a 50th wedding anniversary celebration during the final hours of session when hundreds of bills came to the floor, while Simotas had medical issues.
No Queens lawmaker made NYPIRG’s lists of Assembly and Senate members who prime sponsored the most legislation that made it through their respective chamber — or both.
A prime sponsor is the lawmaker who first backs a measure in his or her house.
Tony Avella (D-Bayside) was among 11 senators who prime sponsored at least 150 active bills in 2014, according to the report.
Avella, a member of the Independent Democratic Conference that had split from mainline Democrats and controlled the Senate with Republicans, was only able to get eight of these measures through both chambers, NYPIRG said.
Smith was the only borough lawmaker to land on NYPIRG’s lists of the 10 Assembly members and senators who drafted the most resolutions adopted by both chambers.
His office said most of the resolutions honored southeast Queens leaders that deserve recognition.
His colleagues approved 79 resolutions, non-binding measures that often urge a course of action or request consideration of a matter.
Toby Stavisky (D-Flushing) also appeared to have few qualms about sounding off on issues.
NYPIRG’s review of Senate transcripts determined she spoke on the floor more than any of her counterparts from Queens.
She was the eighth most talkative senator, uttering 10,435 words this session.
(D-Howard Beach) said 209 words, fewer than every member of the chamber, but Sen.
John Sampson (D-Brooklyn), who was indicted early into the 2014 session, was only recorded saying “aye” once, according to NYPIRG.

NEW DELHI — Smiles rarely left the faces of the top leaders of India and China here on Thursday, but India’s new prime minister sent a tough message to his Chinese guest by pressing him for a resolution to a border dispute that has escalated abruptly.
A large contingent of Indian troops, which one official said numbered in the thousands, was mobilized Thursday to face an equivalent number of Chinese troops in Ladakh, Kashmir, a largely high-altitude, barren Himalayan landscape where jingoism and military conflict have dominated for decades.
Only India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, could have ordered such a mobilization, said Mohan Guruswamy, a military analyst with the Observer Research Foundation.
The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, is in the middle of a three-day Indian visit that has been billed as the beginning of a great economic and political partnership.
Several deals, including for high-speed trains and economic zones, had been promised at a total price tag that officials hinted could reach as much as $100 billion — nearly three times what Japan, China’s foremost Asian rival, recently promised to India.
Modi made clear to the Chinese that India’s patience with an uncertain border situation had worn thin and that any crop of deals must await a territorial resolution, analysts said.
“The prime minister sent a very strong signal that the Chinese have to agree to a fixed line of actual control before we start doing serious business with them,” Mr.
Instead of $100 billion in deals, the sides agreed to a target of infrastructure and industrial development valued at $20 billion to $50 billion.
Modi made some of the most pointed remarks about the border uncertainty that any Indian leader has uttered in decades.
“I raised our serious concern over repeated incidents along the border,” Mr.
“While our border-related agreements and confidence-building measures have worked well, I also suggested that clarification of the Line of Actual Control would greatly contribute to our efforts to maintain peace and tranquillity and requested President Xi to resume the stalled process of clarifying the L.
,” he added, referring to the countries’ shared border.
India has been pressing China for years to delineate a boundary, hundreds of miles of which are in dispute.
Both sides have built up their military presence in the region in recent years.
“We’ve always been the ones pressing for a defined and well-controlled line of control, but the Chinese have always been very evasive about it and have refused to give us a map,” said K.
Shankar Bajpai, a former Indian ambassador to China.
“ Leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which heads India’s government, long complained that the previous government under Manmohan Singh was too timid with Pakistan and China on territorial disputes and incursions.
Last year, when a Chinese platoon camped out for weeks in Ladakh, Mr.
Singh sought mostly to defuse the crisis.
Indian officials had said then that China had created the standoff.
But Indian analysts seemed happy to concede that their side was largely to blame for this escalation.
“The Indians have normally been very placatory,” Mr.
“But this time, it’s India’s show of force.
” Indian military and paramilitary officials declined to provide official comment.
A call to the press line of the Chinese Foreign Ministry was not answered.
Bajpai, the former ambassador, said Mr.
Modi was clearly sending a message to China.
“And his message is that it’s all very nice to talk about business,” Mr.
Bajpai said, “but this territorial stuff is not an area where you can play ducks and drakes with us as you have in the past.

The X-Factor: Delevingne’s decision to wear a gold body chain instead of a shirt underneath her sleek navy suit (reminiscent of Rihanna’s front-row New York Fashion Week looks at Altuzarra and Alexander Wang) was daring, while Moss’s mostly black ensemble was casual yet chic.
But really, it’s the two next to each other, looking effortlessly cool in their own ways, that makes it a true fashion moment.

Uno spettacolo ironico, spassoso, sarcastico e irriverente quello che Les Ballets Trockadero De Monte Carlo, un corpo di ballo rigorosamente maschile, mettono in scena per festeggiare il quarantesimo anniversario dalla nascita, porteranno in scena il 16 al 26 ottobre al Teatro Nuovo di Milano gran parte del loro repertorio rigorosamente classico.
Con i loro corpi atletici, che si destreggiano mirabilmente sulle loro punte numero 45 come cigni, silfidi e romantiche principesse, valorizzano lo spirito della danza come forma d’arte, con un risultato comico irresistibile per ogni tipo di pubblico.
Fondati nel 1974 da un gruppo di appassionati di danza che si divertivano a mettere in scena in modo scherzoso il balletto classico tradizionale presentandolo in parodia e en travesti, LES BALLETS TROCKADERO DE MONTE CARLO presentano i loro primi spettacoli Off-Off-Broadway e ben presto, i Trocks, come vengono affettuosamente chiamati, si sono guadagnati entusiastiche critiche sul New York Times e sul The Village Voice, conquistando il consenso del pubblico e della critica.
Il loro amore nei confronti della danza, il loro approccio comico e la scoperta che gli uomini riescano a danzare sulle punte senza cadere rovinosamente a terra, viene notato non solo a New York ma ben oltre, tant’è che la Compagnia è tra le più famose a livello nazionale ed internazionale.
Fare e disfare valigie, impacchettando grossi tutù e scarpette da punta giganti, correndo tra un aereo e l’altro e tra un pullman e l’altro; questa è la routine quotidiana della Compagnia.
Fin dagli inizi i Trocks si affermano in tutto il mondo come un nuovo fenomeno nella danza e partecipano a numerosi festival di danza in tutto il mondo.
La Compagnia si è esibita in oltre 30 paesi e in 500 città in tutto il mondo a partire dalla sua fondazione nel 1974.
Col passare degli anni la mission de LES BALLETS TROCKADERO DE MONTE CARLO non è cambiata.
La Compagnia è sempre e comunque formata da ballerini (uomini) professionisti che si esibiscono nel vasto repertorio di balletto e di danza moderna, nel pieno rispetto delle regole canoniche del balletto classico tradizionale.
L’aspetto comico nei loro spettacoli viene raggiunto esagerando le manie, gli incidenti ed esasperando le caratteristiche tipiche della danza rigorosa.
Vedere degli uomini danzare in tutti i ruoli possibili – con i loro corpi pesanti che delicatamente si bilanciano sulle punte come cigni, silfidi, spiritelli acquatici, romantiche principesse, angosciate donne Vittoriane, ecc.
– valorizza lo spirito della danza come forma d’arte, deliziando e divertendo sia il pubblico più esperto che meno preparato.
Patricia Dolan, president of the Queens Civic Congress, was struck and killed by a car on Hillside Avenue near 198th Street in Hollis at about 7:35 p.
Dolan, 72, was on her way to a Community Board 8 Transportation Committee meeting at the time.
She was struck by a Nissan sedan that was traveling eastbound and was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead.
The motorist remained at the scene.
A longtime civic leader, Dolan was recently called “probably the longest-working of civic workers in the borough" by Queens Borough President Claire Shulman.
Born in Brooklyn, she came to Queens with her parents as a toddler and still lived in her childhood home in Kew Gardens Hills.
She first became involved in community organizations about 25 years ago, joining the Kew Gardens Hills Civic Association, where she was also president.
In addition, Dolan was a founder and president of the Flushing Meadows Corona Park Conservancy and worked on senior transportation issues with the Queens Community House.
A memorial service will be held on Tuesday, Nov.
at the Schwartz Brothers Forest Park Chapel at 114-03 Queens Blvd.

If he wins a third term, Mayor Bloomberg promised yesterday to transform the city so it’ll have the best public schools in the nation by 2013, a far lower crime rate, better mass transit and more waterfront and park options than ever.
“And we will do it all by living within our means, not by spending money we don’t have,” the mayor said in a speech at NYU.
Topping the list were further improvements to the school system, to the point where families “from around the nation and the region” will be clamoring to come here so their kids can get a quality education at “top-quality schools that are as good as — or better than– some of the suburban schools,” the mayor said.
On the crime front, Bloomberg set the bar high.
He said his goal was to reduce crime by another 15 percent — on top of the 35 percent reduction achieved since 2001.
“It is unfortunate that the mayor continues to make promises that I think the people of New York have seen and heard before,” said Thompson, the city comptroller.
He pointed to the mayor’s high-profile broken pledges, including eliminating homelessness and keeping term limits intact.
The latest Quinnipiac University poll, however, showed Bloomberg was headed for a “blowout” victory.
He was leading 53 percent to 35 percent, with 10 percent undecided.
In a bit of bizarre timing, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn — a Democrat and longtime Bloomberg ally — finally got around to endorsing Thompson yesterday.
The final mayoral debate will be televised tonight on Channel 7 starting at 7 p.
In what is easily the most personally lamentable shutter announcement that I’ve ever posted in ML, I regret to report that beloved K-town mainstay Arirang, has reportedly closed.
During the past decade of eating in K-town, Arirang has been an agent of good times – cheerful and laid back service, cheap soju and fairly priced, awesome food that made the place a bargain whether you’re a lunch time or dinner time punter.
I recall drunk dinners and hungover midweek lunches of sujebi, knife cut flecks of dough, swimming in profoundly rich bowls of chicken broth and many glasses of soju.
Similar fare is non-existent in NYC – one would have to travel to Queens to get something similar.
I recall being so enamored with this place, that I submitted a hackneyed love letter to Zach, thus sealing my place as a contributor to this site over 4 years ago.
In Korean culture, the provenance of the term ‘Arirang‘ – often used as an unofficial Korean national anthem – denotes certain aspects of hope and optimism.
In keeping with this theme, I can only hope that the future proprietor does this space justice.

LONDON – Banco Santander said on Wednesday that it was in talks to potentially combine its asset management arm in a joint venture with Pioneer Global Asset Management, a unit of UniCredit of Italy.
The deal, if consummated, would represent the latest effort by Santander to reshape its asset management operations, which have not been a large contributor to its results.
In 2013, Santander, which is based in Madrid and is one of Europe’s largest banks, entered into an alliance that gave the private equity firms Warburg Pincus and General Atlantic a 50 percent stake in its asset management operations.
The transaction with Pioneer would create an asset manager with 347 billion euros, or about $568.
2 billion, in assets under management and operations in the Americas, Europe and Asia.
“At this time no agreement has been reached as to the potential structure or the terms of that possible transaction,” Santander said in a news release on Wednesday.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that the companies were discussing a transaction in which UniCredit and Santander would each own one-third of the combined business, with the remaining third to be owned by Warburg Pincus and General Atlantic.
At the end of June, Santander Asset Management had about €154.
2 billion euros in assets under management, primarily in Spain, Brazil and Mexico.
The asset management business contributed about €80 million in profit to Santander last year, a 27 percent decline from 2012.
The bank posted an overall profit of €4.
Pioneer has been part of Milan-based UniCredit since 2000, when it acquired Pioneer Investment of Boston.
The business had about €186 million in assets under management as of the end of June.
The unit posted a pretax profit of €193 million in 2013, down 3 percent from 2012.
Unicredit posted a pretax loss of €4.

Of course, home cooking can be stressful, particularly during the week.
Never mind the time spent at the stove.
There is also the time spent planning, and the time spent shopping: invisible labor, more taxing than it seems.
And then someone has soccer practice.
This issue of Dining is dedicated to the core promise of a new website and iPad app that The New York Times introduced last week called Cooking.
Built on a foundation of more than 16,000 old and new recipes in the Times archives, the site and app are designed for cooks of all talents, from beginning to expert.
The mission: to make each one of us a better cook.
So just cook and see what happens.
Gather family or friends to your table and serve them hot food.
Maybe it helps the children do better in school.
) Maybe it strengthens relationships.
) Demonstrably (as you will see.
) it is more pleasant than a microwaved stew or takeout curry or a pizza delivered from miles away.
Here is one way to get started: Imagine a chicken smothered in gravy, cooked on the stove top, served with white rice and steamed green beans with a pat of butter.
It is as pleasant a meal as a September night can offer, and simple to prepare.
Go to the market for a chicken of moderate size.
Get an organic one because it will taste better.
Ask the butcher to take out the backbone if you’re nervous about doing that yourself.
This isn’t a time for more courage than is called for in the preparation of a midweek meal.
(A bird with its backbone removed has been “spatchcocked,” and you can lay it out flat in a pan.
If you want to know how to do that yourself, there is a short instructional video and other tips on cooking techniques at nytimes.
Buy some unsalted butter and, if you don’t have any, a small amount of flour.
You probably have salt and pepper.
Maybe there is some chicken stock in your freezer or refrigerator.
If not, pick up some at the store, the low-sodium kind, better in all ways than its over-salty cousin in a can or cube.
The recipe is a classic, in a collection we’re calling Times Classics, and it comes from Craig Claiborne, a child of Mississippi who started as food editor of The Times in 1957 and did as much as anyone to help bring home cooking into the spotlight.
The dish “belongs in the ‘comfort’ category,” he wrote in 1983, “a food that gives solace to the spirit when you dine on it.
You could give your smothered chicken some European flair with mushrooms and small onions in the gravy, as Claiborne did in his experiments with Pierre Franey, then his kitchen co-pilot.
Or you could send yourself south to the Creole tastes of the Delta, with a blend of tomatoes, chopped celery, onion and green peppers added to the sauce.
Sometimes the easiest way is the best.
First, select a pan in which to cook.
Claiborne believed a cast-iron skillet to be essential to the dish’s success, probably in part for nostalgic reasons and absolutely because cast iron conducts heat so evenly and well.
But any heavy-bottomed pan large enough to hold the chicken will do.
Set it over medium heat, and add a couple of tablespoons of butter.
As it melts and starts to foam, salt and pepper the chicken.
Then add it to the pan, skin side down, and turn the heat to low.
Now, a technique straight out of Claiborne’s mother’s playbook: Put an inverted plate on top of the chicken and weight it down with a full can of tomatoes or beans, a foil-wrapped brick or a small dumbbell — something heavy enough to press the skin of the chicken into the heated surface.
The low heat of the stove combined with the butter and the rendering fat of the chicken will slowly turn the skin golden brown and crisp, so that it releases easily from the pan.
At which point you will turn the chicken over, carefully, and cook it some more.
(Use the downtime to make rice and prepare your green beans.
When the chicken has cooked through, take it out of the pan and pour off all but a couple of tablespoons of the fat in the pan, and make a quick gravy.
There is no need to panic at that command.
Simply sprinkle a few tablespoons of flour into the hot fat and stir it around with a whisk for a few minutes, allowing the raw taste of the flour to diminish.
Then hit the resulting roux with a cup or so of chicken stock, whisking until it thickens.
Return the chicken to the pan with the gravy and allow it to cook yet a little while longer, until it is ridiculously tender, almost coming off the bones.
Then remove to a cutting board, hack into pieces and place on a platter.
Spoon some of the gravy over the top and serve the rest on the side, with the rice and vegetables.
This is weekday cooking to remember and, we hope, the start of a glorious journey toward the delicious.
A Queens lawmaker has drafted a bill that would mandate posted letter health grades for street-meat sellers.
José Peralta (D-Queens) is introducing a measure this week that would require local health departments to come up with a letter-based scale similar to the city’s current restaurant-grading system, following a Post report on the worst of the wurst violators.
“Consumers should know if what they are eating meets certain safety standards,” he said.
“If they have an ‘A,’ you’ll eat there.
” At present, patrons have no way of knowing whether the dirty-water dog they’re about to digest actually deserves the sobriquet.
The city Health Department does not publish online inspection results, let alone grades.
The Post obtained violators’ dirty details through a Freedom of Information request.
The grading system, Peralta said, would push vendors to clean up.
“They’re going to want to achieve the letter A and say, ‘I have the best cart in 10 blocks,’ ” Peralta said.
The sidewalk chefs would have to post their grades on their wagons, he added, and fines for violators who don’t would start at $50.
Cart owners who clean up their act can pay $250 for an immediate reinspection as well.

Break out the bubbly and bring on the poutine: Cartopia's food carts get to keep serving their greasy-good grub for at least two more years.
One of the first organized food cart pods to appear outside of Downtown and a favorite among the late-night crowd, the Southeast Portland lot was supposed to clear out November 1 to make way for a multi-story mixed-use apartment building.
But The Oregonian reports that cart-owners got a reprieve Wednesday, when the landlord offered them the chance to renew their leases for two more years.
The pod is home to some of the city's most successful and long-standing carts, including Whiffie's Fried Pies, Perreira Crepes, Pyro Pizza, and Potato Champion, who posted the good news on their Facebook page.
"We have no info regarding what happened with the sale of the property," the owners wrote.
"We only know that we get to spend two more years serving you all great food from this amazing location.

A few years ago, when my colleague, David Dyssegaard Kallick, and I assessed Mayor Rudolph Guiliani's economic record, we concluded: "Mayor Giuliani often took credit for New York’s booming economy in the 1990s, but the trick in managing New York’s volatile economy during boom times isn't keeping real estate prices up.
The difficult job is making sure the benefits are widespread, diversifying the city's economic base, and preparing for the eventual crash.
On all three measures, over time Mayor Giuliani's legacy is looking worse and worse.
" Boom and bust still characterize the local economy, and despite many ways in which Mayor Michael Bloomberg's tenure has been an improvement over Guiliani's record, his economic leadership similarly has fallen short in ensuring that the benefits of growth are more broadly shared.
He has refused to advocate for better wages, missed a major opportunity to curtail the use of property tax breaks and hasn't re-oriented the investment of city economic development resources away from real estate toward human capital.
Fundamentally, the twists and turns of New York City's economy depend on the national economy.
Mayors aren't responsible for everything that happens on the local economic front, good or bad.
Rather, their economic leadership should be evaluated based on how they respond to the challenges thrown up by broader changes in the economy.
Have they done things to counter the negative trends and help New Yorkers better adapt to economic change.
Have they worked with leaders in Albany and Washington to shape economic policies in a way that benefits the average New Yorker.
Bloomberg has continued the progress made during Giuliani's two terms in the fight against crime, helping to improve the city's quality of life and keeping the city attractive to domestic and foreign migrants.
And there is no doubt that Bloomberg's fiscal stewardship is vastly better than his predecessor's.
While Giuliani repeatedly reduced taxes and made them less progressive, paving the way for a severe fiscal crisis in the early years of Bloomberg's first term, Bloomberg held back some of the surplus revenues during the boom years, anticipating a cyclical downturn that would lower tax receipts.
However, facing a significant revenue shortfall earlier this year, Bloomberg raised the regressive sales tax.
He also supported business tax changes that likely will cost the city tax revenues five or six years down the road.
First, a few indicators of how the local economy has changed.
The economy during the Bloomberg years was precarious one most New York workers and their families.
The economic upswing, in New York City and nationally, was characterized by an unsustainable housing bubble, speculative financial frenzy, and excessive borrowing by households seeking to maintain living standards in the face of escalating housing prices and stagnant wages.
Here in the city, the 2003-2008 "boom" created a local labor market with fewer well-paying jobs and more lower-paying ones, and stagnant wages and family incomes.
Despite these challenges and the mayor's hugely successful career as an innovative and entrepreneurial businessman, his management of New York City's economic fortunes has been pretty conventional.
And given the mayor's background in the financial sector, it is a little puzzling that he seemed to be as caught as off guard as he was by the financial sector implosion, the forces that gave rise to it and the effects that were playing out in New York City as a result of the housing bubble.
In fact, as recently as January 2007, the mayor released a city study that called for further financial deregulation.
Bloomberg, like many mayors before him, has focused the city's economic development resources on mega-real estate deals, re-zoning land for more intensive high-rise commercial and luxury residential development, and lavishing tax breaks and low-cost financing on large and profitable corporations (think Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, New York Yankees and New York Mets).
The economic vision behind the re-zoning of the 60-acre Hudson Yards area -- particularly after the prospects for erecting a professional football stadium on the Far West Side of Manhattan faded -- was of skyscrapers filled with enormous trading floors for an endlessly expanding financial sector.
When the subject of jobs for New Yorkers was raised, officials usually pointed to the retail, restaurant and service jobs that the development would generate.
Most of these jobs pay very low wages, often at or only slightly above the poverty level.
Wages for many New York workers do not have to be as low as they are.
The city has considerable influence it can wield to require developers to pay decent wages and benefits.
It can rezone land, creating an enormous windfall for developers, and it provides generous tax breaks.
Under Bloomberg, the city generally has refused to use that leverage to establish wage and benefit standards despite the fact that job standards are the norm in many cities and states, including Los Angeles and New Jersey.
Even Houston requires recipients of city subsidies to provide 100 percent employer-paid health insurance.
City economic development officials argue that businesses will raise wages when it is good for them so there is no need to compel them to do so.
This ignores the history of labor standards in this country and the evidence of what happens when the wage floor is raised.
Employers adopt more efficient ways of utilizing workers, turnover and recruitment costs decline, and productivity increases.
Moreover, federal government data indicate that the worker productivity (value added per worker) of most sectors in New York City is well above national averages.
In the hospitality sector, the productivity of a New York worker is 75 percent greater than the national average, and in retail, the New York workforce is 39 percent more productive.
New York businesses can afford to pay workers better.
The city's continuing refusal to establish wage standards for subsidized development deals is evident in the Kingsbridge Armory case currently before the City Council.
The Bloomberg administration has agreed to heavily subsidize the project by selling the property to the developer well below market value and providing $14 million in city tax breaks.
A coalition has been pressing for the project to require a living wage, local hiring and community amenities.
The mayor has rejected the coalition’s agenda in favor of giving the developer a freer hand.
The challenge of low wages and the city’s increasing working, but poor, population was highlighted by the Mayor's Commission for Economic Opportunity (aka the "Poverty Commission") in its 2006 report to the mayor.
The commission pointed out that "for too many families, work is no longer a ticket out of poverty.
" One way to change that is to help workers train for more highly paying jobs.
However, during the Bloomberg administration, the city has paid far less attention to improving the human capital of New York's workforce through skills training and career-related vocational education than to the steady stream of real estate deals and mega-projects.
Since most companies rarely invest much in the skills of their workforce (partly out of concern that such "investments" can walk out the door), the city needs to make optimal use of the limited federal government workforce development funding and encourage more businesses and industries to develop career ladders that support and reward workers seeking to improve their skills.
While education is the key to success in the labor market, according to the latest 10-year occupational projections a disproportionate share of New York City's projected net job growth is expected to occur in jobs that require little formal education or skills training, and that are likely to pay wages insufficient to support a family.
It is imperative for the city to do more to promote human capital investments, to increase skill requirements, and to foster the development and expansion of homegrown businesses that rely on more skilled workers.
MIT labor economist Paul Osterman has argued that wage standards are an effective way to put pressure on businesses to make jobs more productive.
In 2006, the city’s Economic Development Corp.
enlisted the assistance of outside economists to help evaluate the city's largest economic development tax break program, the Industrial and Commercial Incentive Program.
In a surging real estate market, the cost of the program was rapidly increasing and recently reached an annual cost of $500 million.
The evaluation concluded that a huge portion of program's breaks were unnecessary, since most companies probably would have made the investments without getting a tax break.
The evaluation suggested that incentives could be curtailed entirely in midtown Manhattan and that retail projects should be sharply limited since retail investments typically follow market opportunities.
Despite these findings, only relatively minor modifications were made to the tax subsidy program.
The real estate community argued that the tax incentives were necessary in midtown -- one of the most desirable and sought-after business locations in the world -- since the city had committed to providing generous commercial property tax breaks in the Hudson Yards district, west of midtown.
Here was a case where City Hall's desire to engage in "creative," off-budget capital financing for one project had locked in decades of commercial property tax breaks.
At the time, Sen, Charles Schumer merely stated the obvious when he remarked that massive public investment in the form of the number 7 subway line extension, parks and other amenities, should have been sufficient inducement to get developers to build along the Hudson River not far from Penn Station, the Javits Convention Center and the Theater District.
During the recent real estate boom, when demand for Manhattan office development was literally sky-high, the city had the opportunity to back away from granting costly commercial property tax breaks.
Particularly in the wake of seismic financial market shifts, everyone wants to see the local economy move away from its over-reliance on Wall Street.
For example, there is justifiably a lot of interest in exploiting opportunities posed by a transition to a "greener" economy.
It's a triple play -- reduced consumption of fossil fuels, a cleaner environment and new jobs to boot.
But along with adding new industries, we should be concerned that the jobs created in them are good jobs, offering decent pay, benefits, training and advancement, and that they employ city residents.
We should also seek to promote real minority entrepreneurial involvement in new and emerging industries.
The mayor's PlaNYC 2030 underscored the environmental benefits of a greener economy.
The various green jobs components of the federal stimulus program (e.
residential weatherization and public building retrofits) will add tremendous resources at an opportune moment, provided the city has the strategic vision to build a local "green jobs" sector.
In this Great Recession, New York City’s unemployment rate has crossed into double digits and is likely to stay unacceptably high for several months, possibly years, to come.
When discouraged workers and the under-employed are factored in, the city’s "real" unemployment rate is about 16 percent.
For blacks and Hispanics, real unemployment is 20 to 25 percent.
And New York has a lot of company -- 30 million Americans are either unemployed, under-employed or have dropped out of the labor market because jobs are so scarce.
For national economic policy, there is little recourse but an expansive job creation program.
The mayor of New York City should be working closely with our elected officials in Washington to design a program that will help struggling small businesses, worried families, our distressed neighborhoods, and that will buttress the provision of critical public services.

I have pretty much quit playing all of my other games, because this is the only one I like to play.
I like the alphabetical order to help find words I didn't know were words.
I also like that it fills in some letters as you go, so it makes it easier to find those words you thought you put in, but didn't (this is probably b/c of the large number of puzzles I have played).
I would like to see the few letters that are shown in your other word games b/c it gets frustrating after a half-hour or so staring at the blanks where the word should be.

When I was growing up in East New York, Brooklyn in the early 90s, most residents were Black or Latinx.
Today, the demographics are still about the same, and very little has changed about the neighborhood.
I distinctly remember noticing that there were no white people that lived near me and that the neighborhoods that had a large percentage of white residents were simply better: They had better schools, nicer streets, more businesses, less crime, and no visible drug use.
It was everything I wanted my neighborhood to be.
As ashamed as I am to admit this now, I assumed that the only way neighborhoods could be bettered is by having white residents, so I hoped that my neighborhood would become like Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
At the time, Williamsburg was rapidly changing, and what used to be dirty streets and run-down businesses were now tree-lined blocks and shiny Starbucks.
What I failed to understand then was that the gentrification of neighborhoods might make the space look better, but my family would never be able to afford the price of living there.
Although my childhood neighborhood is still far from gentrification due to its distance from New York City and history of gang violence, drug use, and poverty, things seem to be changing, as this real estate listing demonstrates by calling East New York “the new frontier.
” Gentrification is new-wave colonialism, and it has economic, societal, and public health repercussions for poor communities of color.
Many times when wealthy people move into a low-income neighborhood, they truly want to help.
Oftentimes, they even start community programs and become leaders in the community, often through beautification projects.
And while I get why this seems to be good at first glance, it really isn’t.
When neighborhoods are gentrified, those moving in are looking for cheap rent and the ability to make a better life for themselves.
And while wealthier people may feel entitled to buy or rent wherever they wish (as is indeed their right), they must also understand the consequences of their actions.
As our neighborhoods become “up-and-coming areas” that “evoke images of burned-out buildings, riots, and poverty,” the people that lived there through the poverty and disrepair deserve to stay in their homes and have a community that supports their needs.
We need to understand that gentrification isn’t about beautifying neighborhoods and making them safer.
It is the systematic displacement of people of color from their homes.
Gentrification hurts communities of color, and these are some of the ways how.
As this study states, the median rent prices in New York City rose 75% since 2001.
This same trend can be seen in other neighborhoods that have currently become gentrified, like Oakland, California.
It’s common to see landlords bully low-income tenants into moving out by not maintaining apartments or not renewing their lease, forcing residents to move out.
I’ve seen this happen to many of my relatives that moved to New York City in the early 70s and settled in the Lower East Side and Soho neighborhoods of lower Manhattan.
While these areas are now the first choice of home for celebrities and ritzy events like the TriBeCa Film Festival, they were previously filled with tenement buildings and low-income housing.
One of my aunts who still lives in what is now the very trendy Soho pays for all repairs and upgrades in her apartment, as the building owners refuse to do so in an effort to bully her into leaving and renting her apartment at a much higher cost.
Yes, it’s illegal, but they know she could never afford a lawyer.
None of her neighbors remain, and none of the local businesses she frequented are still the same.
Even her local church no longer offer services in her language.
I ask her often why does she remain, although I know the answer: That’s her home.
Poor people of color living in gentrified neighborhoods find themselves between a rock and a hard place.
They are often unable to move because they could never afford housing elsewhere, but are constantly pushed to the limit by landlords looking to rent at higher prices.
It’s illegal, but that doesn’t help a person who does not understand the law or hire someone to help them navigate the legal system.
Many of these communities are comprised of immigrants that have lived in the United States for decades, yet have no resources left in their communities.
They face language, cultural, and societal barriers that set them at a disadvantage next to real estate companies and developers.
If wealthier residents are moving into a low-income neighborhood, it follows that they will spend more on local businesses and generate more profit for them.
Yet, unfortunately, this is rarely the case.
Businesses have a hard time catering to two different types of clientele, though they often try to do so.
It’s common to see grocery stores start selling a wider variety of products to attract new residents, but few actually see the increase in profits they thought they would because new residents often shop in places they feel more comfortable in.
Likewise, new businesses that open up specifically to cater to the new residents bring new competition to the old ones, further straining the local community.
New businesses open to cater to the wealthier residents of the neighborhood and existing shops are forced to either a) change their practices to appeal to new residents and survive or b) stick with their old clientele and likely lose their business.
Additionally, rent increases affect businesses as much as they do low-income residents.
The only businesses that can thrive under these circumstances are large corporations like Whole Foods.
Whole Foods, unlike other local supermarkets, attract a new set of people and completely changes a neighborhood.
This is evident in the way Whole Foods changed the neighborhood of Jamaica Plain in Boston.
While Jamaica Plain already had a large and affordable supermarket called Hi-Lo, open since 1964 and known for selling Latin American products, it couldn’t compete with Whole Foods.
Needless to say, Hi-Lo had to close because it could not keep up with Whole Foods, and just like that, low-income residents of Jamaica Plain were left without a place to shop for groceries that were affordable and culturally relevant.
As this article states, “That’s because Hi-Lo and Whole Foods aren’t just stores, they’re ideas that lead to similar ideas, and attract people who identify with those ideas in cyclical fashion.
” People of color, and especially Black people, are often perceived as dangerous and thuggish.
As the recent shooting of Mike Brown – an unarmed young Black man in Ferguson, Missouri – further proves, the stereotyping of racial minorities has dangerous consequences.
Black and Latino men are disproportionately arrested, especially for marijuana use and distribution, while white men who do the same are celebrated.
And we can’t assume that justice is the same for everyone.
In this article, un-ironically titled “I Spent a Day Delivering Weed in New York City,” the author repeatedly states that these are not your “normal” drug dealers, therefore, not a threat to your safety.
Our neighborhoods are often the only place where we can feel at home, but as neighborhoods get gentrified, activities such as panhandling and sleeping in public places become criminalized, too.
While not having poor people live on your streets might be a priority for wealthier residents, the response should be to help them, not arrest them.
If people of color are getting arrested for everything from drug use to being poor, I don’t think it’s safe to say that gentrification is improving our neighborhoods and making them safer.
The reality is that the incarceration of Black and Brown men create the illusion of safety for white residents, but it’s a sense of security based on stereotypes of Black and Brown men being thugs, criminals, and dangerous.
The need to feel safe, which is an absolute human right, is a necessity, but the way we achieve that in gentrified neighborhoods is missing the mark.
Crime happens because former residents of gentrified neighborhoods live in poverty and suffer from lack of resources and poor educational and health services.
Gentrification is driven by the private sector.
Close-knit communities thrive on socially conscious business practices that benefit everyone.
Local shops often allow families to shop on credit and use public assistance funds without shame.
Communities often get together for block parties and potlucks, and in general, there is a sense that you will be taken care of.
But when newcomers see existing residents as dangerous, this feeling of community is hampered.
In my childhood neighborhood, I would often babysit and tutor younger children that lived near me.
Although some parents would give me some form of payment, I did it because it was the only way to serve my community – a community that had few affordable childcare centers and no tutoring services.
It was a community, as imperfect as it may be.
Today, I live in a different neighborhood – one that is far more gentrified than the place where my family still lives, and a lot less reassuring.
I have a dog park, a Planet Fitness, a yoga studio, and a coffee shop all within reach, but I have neighbors I have never met, and I could never ask my local grocer to give me a loaf of bread on credit.
And I will be sincerely honest: I absolutely love that every Sunday, I have a community garden where I can go shop for local and organic produce and walk one block back to my apartment.
But it will never compare to the free hot dogs I ate while playing near the fire hydrant on a hot summer day in Brooklyn.
Children who live in areas of concentrated poverty never fare well.
They often have low graduation rates and deal with constant violence.
So it follows that gentrification should improve the lives of poor children of color.
There is no denying that diverse schools, both economically and racially, are a good learning space for all children.
When children are exposed to a variety of individuals, they have a better understanding of the world.
However, what happens to neighborhoods also happens to schools.
As former residents are pushed out, so are the children attending local schools, which disturbs their learning process.
While schools do tend to improve and start providing amenities that children benefit from with the increase in capital coming in from the higher income of new residents, few minority children stick around to enjoy these perks.
With poverty rates for children at a staggering 22% in the United States, it’s important to make sure that all amenities and community programs that come with gentrification are also available to poor residents.
Yet with the profit-driven model that arises as communities are gentrified, it’s unlikely that any children will benefit from gentrification.
Children succeed when their parents are capable of providing for them.
When parents are unable to afford their own neighborhood amenities, their children start seeing the difference along racial and social barriers and internalize it.
Vibrant communities that rely on social networking are torn apart with gentrification.
Neighbors that people once relied on move out, and services that were beneficial to the community are replaced.
For those that stay, they become outsiders in their own communities.
In a similar manner, communities that have historically banded to build a community through strife – like Black people in Harlem, New York and Latinxs in the Mission District of San Francisco – begin to see their tight-knit and flourishing communities disbanded.
This is evident in the way Vogue categorically dismissed the neighborhood of Bushwick in Brooklyn as a “disfavored neighborhood.
” A year later — and a lot more white and affluent residents to sell magazines to — it’s the 7th coolest neighborhood, due in part to the new influx of white artists to the previously “grimy, industrial Bushwick.
” Yet Bushwick already had a thriving community of artists all along, and it’s where celebrities such as Rosie Perez and Eddie Murphy hailed from.
While it’s understandable that communities can (and do.
) change as time passes, their histories must be protected.
After all, we still associate Plymouth Rock and lower Manhattan with Dutch settlers, and that was over 500 years ago.
The truth is that new developments and fancy coffee shops will never replace the social network that helped local residents survive.
Residents that fear being displaced and losing their social network are under a lot of stress.
Those who want to remain grapple with rising rent and food prices, while those that leave lose a lot of their hard-earned capital.
Disparities in health become acute when neighborhoods change rapidly and existing marginalized communities are pushed to the peripheries.
External problems manifest themselves in mental and physical health issues, such as anxiety and depression, or high blood pressure and heart problems.
The psychological effects of losing one’s tight-knit community and deep social links can be traumatizing for some.
It’s important to note that gentrification doesn’t just affect our views; it affects our perceptions and mentality.
Public health programs must address issues that displaced people deal with daily, from lack of access to affordable healthy food to subpar housing.
They change through the years, and there is nothing wrong with an organic shift in the demographics of a neighborhood.
But it shouldn’t happen at the expense of poor people and people of color.
Poor communities of color have spent years battling disinvestment and abandonment, but redevelopment only seems to occur when white and wealthy people move into a neighborhood.
It’s important to keep in mind that gentrification might make a neighborhood beautiful, but only for a select few people.
If we truly believe in improving and redeveloping our neighborhoods, we must do so for everyone – regardless of social, racial, or economic status.

With Detroit Downbeat on 2008, Its Suppliers Are Singing the Blues Carmakers expect 2008 to be challenging, but hundreds of automotive parts suppliers are anticipating the year ahead to be one of the ugliest ever.
Icahn’s American Real Estate Partners had improved its offer in the past week to $37.
25 a share, but some shareholders said Lear was worth far more.
One of the biggest shareholders criticized the company’s deal to sell itself for $2.
8 billion to the investor Carl C.
who recently spent $200 million to increase his stake in Lear to nearly 16 percent, has offered to acquire the entire company.
Analysts say troubled suppliers have become attractive investments because they can be bought cheaply, demand for parts is growing and interest rates are low.
We delivered and installed this modular aluminum wheelchair ramp for Jonathan “Hot Wheels” Villanueva, 19 here in Belmar, NJ, a disabled hurricane Sandy victim’s home with his mother Michele Colón.
After we completed the ramp, Wheels rolled up and then back down the ramp as if it were there all his life.
Once back at the bottom of the ramp, Wheels said he was going to stand up and give US a standing ovation to show his gratitude.
Shockingly, he did so and then blew us all away when he then proceeded to Walk all the way up and back down again unassisted.
He had been crawling up and down those stairs and passing his wheelchair over his body every time he came and left alone too….
of Transportation plan to enforce the new Vision Zero policy at a Forest Hills intersection has residents concerned about the effects it could have on traffic.
At last week’s Community Board 6 meeting, members discussed a DOT plan that would make some traffic changes at the intersection of Queens and Yellowstone boulevards.
According to the DOT, among the plan for the intersection is to widen medians on Queens Boulevard to create safer pedestrian crossings, install plastic bollards on Yellowstone Boulevard to prevent u-turns and restrict left turns from Yellowstone northbound to Queens Boulevard going westbound.
The agency said the changes are being made to improve safety for drivers and pedestrians in the area.
According to statistics provided by DOT, there were a total of 85 injuries from 2007 to 2011 and one pedestrian fatality in 2012.
But some residents in the area say the changes could have a negative impact on the area.
Barbara Stuchinski, the president of the Forest Hills Civic Association, said it will be very difficult for drivers if they are coming from Queens Boulevard and are looking to get onto Yellowstone Boulevard.
They would have to drive one to two blocks up what she described as a “big hill” and make a left turn to get onto Queens Boulevard.
She also said that this plan would drive away some business from the stores on Yellowstone Boulevard because that left turn will no longer be available to them.
“If you’re coming from the south side of Queens Boulevard and you want to go to one of those stores, it seems like an impossibility,” Stuchinski said.
She said, instead of this plan, the traffic could be better controlled by making minor changes, including changing the timing of the traffic lights.
The plan will officially be underway soon, with Frank Gulluscio, the District Manager of Community Board 6, saying that the project is a done deal despite resident concerns.
In order to promote dialogue in this situation, Gulluscio said representatives from DOT will appear at a CB6 meeting within the next two months to discuss the plan and iron out any problems residents have with the intersection plan.
In September, homes in the elite Los Angeles suburb of Hidden Hills consumed an average of nearly four and a half megawatt hours of electricity, which paid an average monthly electric utility bill of more than $1,200 for doing so.
The typical household in Hidden Hills, a gated residential community with a total all land area of 1.
7 square miles, used significantly more electricity in 2012 (especially in September) than any other city in California, according to new data released by the California Public Utility Commission.
This gives the good people of Hidden Hills, which includes the likes of Sean Penn, Melissa Ethridge and Britney Spears, the ignominious honor of being California’s biggest energy hog.
Residents of Hidden Hills are unlikely to lose sleep over their elephant-sized monthly electric bills considering that Hidden Hills boasted the strongest concentration of upper-end incomes in America in 2011, according to data from the U.

Glowing from the approval of a $1 billion revitalization plan, Los Angeles City Council members proclaimed Wednesday L.
River Day, hailing its pending rebirth and the possible return of endangered steelhead trout.
But behind the scenes, other officials were working on a separate ambitious plan that could suck up much of the river’s water.
Two city agencies are drafting a new proposal to purify treated sewage and refill the groundwater basin, where wells would pump it up, eventually leading to the taps of homes and businesses.
Right now that very same treated water that used to be sewage flows into the Los Angeles River from a Van Nuys plant.
Under this new plan, much of it would instead be pumped into the ground, leaving the river’s water levels substantially lower.
“Maybe 60 years from now we won’t be kayaking on the river,” said Council for Watershed Health program director Mike Antos, who leads the Los Angeles Basin Water Augmentation Study.
That scenario is not a given at this point, but it is among the range of possible outcomes.
It comes into conflict with Mayor Eric Garcetti’s plan to make the L.
River more welcoming for birds, businesses and residents.
Army Corps of Engineers recently gave its support to the $1 billion plan, with costs to be shared among federal, state and local agencies.
His plan depends on the same scarce ingredient that is key to the purification proposal — clean water.
As the drinking water plan advances, city leaders will have to balance these competing interests.
By 2022, the Department of Water and Power and the Bureau of Sanitation want to purify much of the sewage effluent coming from the Donald C.
Tillman Water Reclamation Plant, near the intersection of the 101 and the 405 freeways.
To fulfill this DWP plan would mean no longer pumping the plant’s water into the river but instead sending it into the groundwater basin.
Today, about 30 million gallons of treated outflow is emptied into nearby lakes and the L.
River each day, according to a preliminary study of the purification plant.
That happens to be the same amount that officials want to purify for drinking water.
Will there be enough left over for recreation.
“It depends on how much river you want under your kayak,” said Jim McDaniel, the senior assistant general manager at the Department of Water and Power.
McDaniel and other water industry leaders were speaking Wednesday at Woodbury University in Burbank, at a forum presented by BizFed, an L.
County business advocacy group.
There could be more effluent by the time the plant is built, he said after the forum, if the economy performs well and businesses expand.
But in some stretches of the river, more than 90 percent of today’s water comes from the treatment plants, McDaniel said.
“There’s going to have to be balance,” he added.
“There’s a finite amount of water there.
” As the DWP is planning the groundwater replenishment facility, it is also working to clean up pollutants in the San Fernando Valley basin.
The purification plant is estimated to cost $400 million to build, with $19 million in annual operating costs, while the chemical remediation plant could cost between $600 million and $900 million to build.
Funding sources have not yet been finalized.
This would be the second time the city tried to replenish the groundwater basin with treated sewage.
In 2000, it pulled the plug on a project dubbed by skeptics as “toilet to tap.
” As officials try to gather support for the project, which adds another layer of purification, they will study how much water would flow into the L.
Public comments on the draft environmental impact report will be accepted around mid-2015, according to the DWP.
That will be the time environmentalists, businesses, water consumers and others can make their case about the river’s future.
“The riddle is: ‘What do we want the river to be.
’” said Antos from the water study group.
“In the long-term, all these things can be balanced, but it’s a choice on our part.

When we all heard about Sugar Bear cheating on Mama June, we were all like, Nooooooo.
But then things got a little weird.
For one, Sugar Bear denied he cheated on Mama June or was dating.

If the cheating scandal IS fake, it seems Sugar and Mama are following in the PR footsteps of other couples whose breakups seem suspiciously bogus.

Il programma è nuovo di zecca, ma la copertina è sempre la sua.
Maurizio Crozza anche a diMartedì, il talk di Giovanni Floris su La7 si prende il palco e di fronte a un divertitissimo Pierluigi Bersani, si lancia nella sua imitazione.
In un immaginario colloquio telefonico fra l'ex segretario del Partito Democratico e Fassina, fa dire a Bersani: "Hai sentito cosa mi ha detto Renzi.
Vecchia guardia, forse; anziano, lo accetto; vecchio bacucco, ancora ancora: guarda, Fassina, passi pure vecchio rincoglionito, ma conservatore non scherziamo.
Io che non sono riuscito neanche a conservarmi il posto di lavoro.
Poi Bersani-Crozza pensa a come guadagnarsi la stima del nuovo presidente del Consiglio: "Forse con una cena elegante".
E così si fa passare al telefono i suoi: la Bindi, Cuperlo, Pippo Civati.
Finita l'imitazione si rivolge direttamente a Bersani in studio: "Cosa ci fa da solo in studio.
Una riunione della minoranza del Pd.
Ci è mancato tanto negli ultimi 20 anni, ci è sempre mancato, ma stavolta Renzi ha esagerato".
Infine una battuta anche per Matteo Renzi, presidente di un governo che "ha più consensi a destra che a sinistra".
"Di recente, Renzi ha fatto visita al cervelli italiani emigrati nella Silicon Valley.
Questi non appena se lo sono trovato davanti hanno detto: "Minchia ci ha trovato, dobbiamo andare più lontano".
E poi ancora: "Ve lo immaginate Renzi che fa le valigie per andare in America.
Allora il Pd l'ho spento, le riforme le ho congelate, la spina ai sindacati l'ho staccata, l'acqua alla Madia l'ho data.
Ora saluto il babbo, oh cazzo il babbo me l'hanno indagato per bancarotta fraudolenta.
Mi hanno accusato di essere il figlio di Berlusconi, ma anche il mio babbo vero mica scherza".

She declared she had to put on 'the greatest show on earth, during the greatest show on Earth' and Madonna certainly didn't disappoint.
The singer, 53, put on an impressive performance during the halftime show of the NFL Super Bowl XLVI football game between the New York Giants and the New England Patriots.
There was just one small slip-up onstage where the singing legend was strutting her way across the bleachers to Music, the second song in her set, and was unable to step up onto one of them and had to repeat the dance move to hoist herself up.
Despite the tiny mistake Madonna stunned crowds, singing her way through classic hits Vogue, Like a Prayer and Music, as well as performing her new song Give Me All Your Luvin.
While the pressure to perform well was immense and greatly felt, Madonna rose to the challenge and she can be thankful she avoided any Janet Jackson-style wardrobe malfunctions.
Split-tacular: Madonna was lifted high up into the air with her legs in the splitsShe lip-synced her way through the hit 80’s hit as she strut around the stage with supersized projections be displayed on the stage beneath her.
As she 'Vogued' her way around the stage throwing angular shapes around with her arms Madonna paid homage to the magazine with graphics covering the floor.
Next up came Music where she took to the bleachers, and suffered her small slip-up as she danced her way down the steps with a group of gymnastic males.
As a dancer on a wire showed off his skills she hip thrust her way through the performance.
LAMFAO then joined her on stage and the song was mashed up with their hit.
Madonna was seen climbing onto the shoulders of one of the band before hip thrusting some more on the DJ booth.
With a rip of her skirt and a grab of some golden pom poms the show moved seamlessly into her new track Give Me All Your Luvin.
As well as a team of cheerleaders Madonna was joined by Nicki Minaj and MIA and the performances formed a triangle with Madonna at the head.
While the focus was clearly on Madonna, MIA appeared to want to cause controversy and was seen swearing into the camera.
As the lights dimmed a church choir was seen taking to the stage, giving Madonna an opportunity to don a floor-length priest's outfit.
Cee Lo Green also donned a sequined ensemble and joined Madonna on an alter which raised up into the air as they sang Like a Prayer.
With the large backing choir behind them the show ended with a loving message, as Madonna disappeared under the stage the words 'World Peace' was written on the large screen floor.
It appeared Madonna's performance proved popular with celebrities and many famous faces took to Twitter to congratulate the veteran performer.
am of the Black Eyed Peas tweeted: '#whatdoyouthinkofthehalftimeperformance I thought madonna rocked.
I'm so proud of my guys lmfao #madonnaisalegend.
' Meanwhile 30 Rock star Alec Baldwin also had something to say and posted: 'Two quarters of Superbowl and the strongest performer is Madonna.
' Snoop Dogg, Sharon Osbourne and Rosie O'Donnell also gave rave reviews of Madonna's act.
But not everyone was as impressed.
Piers Morgan and Seth MacFarlane took a more critical approach with their review.
The CNN presenter commented: 'Yuk.
O’Brien talks about his budget recommendation, rehashing previous power points about losing tax money and state aid while paying out more for increasing health care costs.
No taxes are going up — the $10 million levy will stay where it is — but he does point out 129 city positions will be lost.
The initial budget deficit started in the neighborhood of $14.
3 million dollars, which he says he whittled down to $7 million by freezing remaining job vacancies and offering early retirement.
He says the recent vote in the state legislature show the Governor and House agree with his plan to move municipal unions into a “GIC-like” health care plan.
Bargaining with Locals continues, he adds: “We need [the 129 workers] and we value each of them very much.
” “This budget will have a positive impact on the Worcester Public Schools,” citing Chapt.
3 million), but factoring in the loss of stimulus money balances that out to a “net gain of approximately $8.
” He says employee health insurance changes could “generate up to $8 million in cost increase avoidance that could be re-directed to the classrooms.
” Moylan says his budget cuts 19 positions.
Over the years there’s been a “disproportionate” scope of cuts even as the “scope…has increased.
” “We are now down to areas that just don’t make any sense…if you look at my budget impact statement you’ll see things we’ve had success with that are downright eliminated.
” This includes yard waste sites at Clark St.
The graffiti team will be eliminated, as will Keep Worcester Clean and Nuisance Team.
Three public beaches will be closed* and certain parks will get “absolutely no levels of service” to redirect services to the other city parks (he doesn’t say which ones).
*We received an email from the city this morning that said the beaches are funded in the budget and will not be closed.
No handicap parking signs,” etc.
“Instead what will have to happen is we will have to outsource that…generally speaking when you outsource something it costs about 3x more than when you do it in house.
” Parking control officers will be cut except for in the downtown area, which saves $60,000 in employee costs but ruins $120,000 in future revenue from parking tickets.
” “My concern is about DPW is we always seem to get the job done.
Last year I was concerned that we were close to failure.
That if the wrong kind of incident occurred, like another ice storm…we would fail.
” Deputy Chief Steven Sargent says they’re expecting to lose 27 officers and 8 sergeants, along with civilian jobs.
Community Impact will bear the brunt of the hit.
Accident investigations will stop unless they’re high profile or linked to another investigation.
Neighborhood watch officers will still work, anti-violence will stay intact.
Priority staffing will go towards operations for call and response duties.
“It will ultimately effect the moral.
Fire Chief Gerard Dio says he came up with a reduction plan a few years ago, but this plan “negates” what he had.
In ten years he says he’s lost 100 fire fighters.
The plan equates to 2 captains, 6 lieutenants and 35 fire fighters: same as two companies.
Brownouts were discussed like they used last year, but they’re for the short term and don’t work as long term plans, he says.
“It’s a dark picture that we have to deal with and we try to deal with it the best we can.
” “You will start to see decreased response times…I don’t know the long-term effect of reducing two more companies in a city of this size.
O’Brien says this year’s budget meetings will be different than last year, which means they’ll have three public budget hearings.
5/10, 5/17 and 5/24 from 6:00 to 8:00 pm are the dates and times.
7:42: Haller says “there’s no appetite” to raise taxes.
She wants to know what loss of income the unions that did take the manager’s HC plan will face.
O’Brien says “it’s a dynamic network that controls costs…the average family in the city…would save at least $1,700″ if moving over from Blue Cross/Blue Shield.
There’s also a deal to create a “health savings account” and use the months of no premiums employees will get for switching to bulk it up.
7:47: Haller has the Manager reiterate that by taking the city’s HC plan the city could save the anti-graffiti team, summer impact, etc.
O’Brien also says he’d use one-time money to bridge whatever gap is left if the unions take the new HC plan, but he won’t use (substantially more) one time money to plug the budget hole without HC reforms.
Haller: “This will have a devastating impact on District 4.
I urge, hope, plea for our city employees” to come to an agreement with the city.
“Public safety is our highest priority…It will take six months to destroy a lot of properties, but it will take years to get it back.
” Rushton: “We don’t have to repeat” what will happen to the city with these cuts.
” He says “it’s time to push the ball across the goal line” in regards to negotiations.
“The majority of this council will not raise taxes…Failure at these negotiations is not an option.
” He adds that he’s optimistic.
Toomey: “I’m loathe to have to work with this budget…it is difficult for us to try to bring business in…that will create a greater problem…What was outlined for us today will make fewer people work even harder.
” Palmieri: He starts with giving the manager and unions credit as they work through this, but calls this “beyond comprehension…I know the manager is not going to let that happen and I know the unions won’t let this happen…we’re not going to go thirty years back…it’s going to be a successful negotiation.
” Lukes: Budget decisions often have been delayed because of last-minute deals and agreements.
But, she says, no rabbits will be pulled out of hats.
There are no hands that are hidden.
Decisions will have to be made…I understand the art of negotiations.
Perhaps we’re in dire consequences now, but unions want to get the best contracts for their employees for the next two to three years.
” But, she says “generosity is not going to be an element” in the negotiations because of the multi-year recession.
“We have enough leadership out there that understands we have no where else to go,” she pleads to the negotiators.
“Don’t wait for the state legislature to do anything.
Let’s do it here and now for the city’s sake.
” 8:09: Lukes talks about her amendment to the tobacco ordinance which would give stores three months to sell their cigarette stock before the ban goes into place.
Toomey says that’s best so Clancy can be here to vote on it.
8:12: Lukes wants to know if we can add information to water bills that say how much of the bill comes from EPA mandates.
She also wants to know what the additional money we’ll have to spend to satisfy the latest mandate will go towards.
Moylan says the rising fees this year do not factor in “anticipated” cost increases if the city loses its suit against the EPA.
The council votes in the increased water and sewer rates.
CSX is held once again so they can address Putnam Lane’s closure and the National Grid work all at the same time.
8:19: Toomey says Rice Lane School had no crosswalk for a while because of street re-paving.
It’s there now but she wants better foresight for this.
8:23: Palmieri talks about the USDA/ALB meeting yesterday.
“I thought it was eventful and interesting…The critical issue that we continue to ask is the inoculations of the host trees.
” “There seems to have been a change in what they want to do at this juncture…without really participating the way this council thought in inoculating more trees with the USDA.
” He’s upset that the USDA and DCR won’t re-inoculate trees that got it last year.
There is a way to privately obtain the inoculate and use it, but Palmieri says there’s going to have a be a real concerted effort to get that information out there.
He’s skeptical this will save many trees, “but we need to have a real proactive approach…we should have a program in place that is unlike any other place in the country because we are devastated by the ALB…we can’t just be cutting down infested trees and not inoculating host trees.
” Haller asks if there’s enough of that medicine over the counter to warrant sending out letters to constituents.
Smith calls the USDA’s decision “completely baffling…they might want to wash their hands of all the trees in the Greendale/Burncoat area, but I’m not ready to do that…guess what, if you don’t treat them they’re going to become infested.
” “There’s no logic behind these decisions that are being made…There comes a point where we have to expect and demand more.
The residents demand more…Funding is not an issue.
They have enough money to do the chemical treatments.
” 8:34: Toomey talks about the April 24, 1916 Easter Rising when the Irish declared independence from the British government.
Rushton commends the Navy SEALs and Obama administration for “getting that bastard.
We have this giant warehouse and sometimes maybe an item or two or ten gets inadvertently pushed to the back of one of the many shelves and maybe we sort of lose track of it and forget we have it.
But then one day we find it again.
In any case, as happy as we may be to see the thing again, we do realize that while this wonderful item may not be exactly what one would call stale, it surely is no longer exactly fresh.
So the logical thing, the only thing, is to lower its price.
So as you can see, our human frailty devolves to your potential benefit.
That's how we talk, here at the warehouse.

It's a happy design-loving dog, indeed, with his own house by Hong Kong-based designer Michael Young.
Quite possibly inspired by the Jetsons, Young's dog house is made from stainless steel and rotational-molded polyethylene, which is my favorite kind.
Comes complete with clever doggie steps which should be filled with with water for stability if you truly care about your dog.
Also your dog needs to be under forty pounds or it will be too big for the house.
Design, like Fashion, favors the thin.
The price used to be an incredible-but-worth-it $1000, but is now only a trim $400.
Don't let your dog be disappointed.
Photos are from the doghouse on display at Moss.
Except for ones of Astro and Jetson's home base.
This colorful collapsible funnel is simple and ingenious: it only takes up space when you're using it.
The rubber-like material is soft, and flexible enough to be collapsed again and again and again and again, yet is rigid enough to keep its shape and can withstand hot and cold temperatures.
I used to go out with someone like that.
Scottish-born textiles queen Donna Wilson was Designer of the Year at the prestigious British Design Awards 2010.
Since 2003, when she opened her studio, she has created an entire alternate universe of curious, playful, irresistible knitted creatures, like this one, Albert, who is described by Donna this way: "Loves chicken chowmein.
" INFLATE is a well known British company which began by making inflatable objects, like pool toys.
In the early days of the company, they also experimented with some wilder ideas.
What you are looking at here is one of those wild ideas.
It's two long narrow rubber "fields", punctuated with plastic flower holders their entire length.
On one end of each is a nozzle and the intention is that the user should FILL THE RUBBER FIELD with water.
Fill it until there's a solid base of water in each.
The small white flower holders are open to the water inside the field, and therefore when the user places a lovely stemmed flower in each of the 29 holders on each field, you suddenly have an active double field of flowers, right in your living room.
Perhaps not surprisingly, this amazing product did not move into production, and these are the only known examples of this experiment in bringing together water, rubber and flowers.
Despite their age (we believe they date from early 2000), they are both in perfect condition.
They can of course be used outdoors but, really, why would you.
Note that in the photo, the fields are NOT filled with water, which is why they look so flat.
There's a very famous Japanese wrestler named Koichiro Kimura but we're pretty sure it's not the same Koichiro Kimura who designed this simple and elegant lunch box.
Ironically, this box, which consists of three round containers and a lid, which can double as a serving plate, is made from an extremely tough polyeurethane and would probably withstand a round or two with the wrestler.
The White Coral Spoon is by the great American designer Ted Muehling, for Porzellan Manufaktur Nymphenburg.
It's as though you can feel the slightly rough, brittle surface of coral when you hold this delicate spoon in your hand.
The haptic quality of the bisque porcelain is similar to that of the crustacean.
I've always suspected that was the case, and now here's the proof.
The best part is you can have as many of these spoons as you want now because instead of $420 each, which was ridiculous, they're only $125.
I guess its just your lucky coral day.
ATLANTIC CITY – Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, the fourth boardwalk casino here to close this year, was pronounced dead at 5:59 a.
on a Tuesday, which in and of itself seemed an insult.
In the end, the 30-year-old onetime hotbed of glamor looked like it had smoked too much, had drunk too hard and needed a shower.
Trump Plaza sat in the center of the boardwalk.
Come off the Atlantic City Expressway, and there it loomed, a white monolith projecting surrender in stained carpets, roped-off pits and the neon U LAZA sign staring balefully down the boardwalk.
Few gamblers came to see it off, though Marie Morlachetta stopped by late Sunday night to say goodbye to the staff and to pronounce — upon discovering no toilet paper in her bathroom stall — “This place has been going to the dogs for a long time, but I still love it.
” On the morning of the casino’s closing, a memorabilia collector parks himself among the rows of blinking, blaring, vacant slots and keeps feeding it titos – ticket in, ticket out – to get one time-stamped as close as possible to the final minute.
But mostly the dealers pack up chips, and cocktail waitresses serve the last of the vodka and coffee, and everyone checks their watches.
That evening, they gather by the hundreds at a 24-hour bar where they used to go to decompress.
They call out to each other, a parade of Johnnies and Kennys and Joeys and Ritchies and Debbies.
Some left the Plaza years ago for the greener pastures of casinos in other states, but many spent their entire careers there.
“We spent 30 years together,” says Debbie Fortier, a cocktail waitress.
“We were together longer than most marriages.
” They spill out in the parking lot and smoke cigarettes and take pictures and tell stories about the days when Donald Trump still ran the place and the high rollers laid down $10,000 bets and tipped $1,000 a hand and celebrities floated through like fairy dust.
“It was exhilarating,” says dealer Ken Gonsalves, who opened the place in 1984.
The Plaza had become the limping property at the back of a herd of what were once 12 casinos in Atlantic City.
No one was surprised when it failed to outrun the logic of the convenience gambler, the day-tripper upon whom Atlantic City had become dependent.
“Why would I drive two and half hours to come here, when door-to-door from my house to Mount Airy Casino is 45 minutes.
” asks Peter Bryn of Budd Lake, N.

So sounds the death knell of an East Coast monopoly.
So goes the elbow-throwing era of state-sanctioned casino gambling.
Get in while the getting is good.
Divert the stream of cash before it crosses the border.
In 2006, gross gaming revenue was $9.
5 billion in the northeastern U.
7 billion, a three percent annual growth rate, says David G.
Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
The new lure customers from the old.
A favored word in play: cannibalization.
“The monopoly of gaming for Atlantic City ended five years ago, and the fact that no one woke up and said this is a chapter that’s closing and we need a new chapter was beyond me,” says Mayor Don Guardian, who took office in January and whose campaign slogan was “A New Beginning.
” “We put all our eggs in one basket, and you never put all your eggs in one basket.
” The air in Atlantic City these days is laced with belated recognition.
This city is famous for its pessimism (“I heard a guy complain that if Fort Knox brought a traveling exhibition of gold bars to the convention center, overnight they’d turn to lead.
” “You building Atlantic City’s future.
” asks the reporter to the worker outside the massive Bass Pro Shop construction site.
) But that’s not all to be found here.
Atlantic City has always been a place of contradiction.
Neon artificiality, food -stamp reality, persistent urban decay, spectacular natural beauty, multiethnic, multiracial, multilingual – it’s a town that gets beneath the skin, refusing to allow you to give up on it.
“The locals call it getting sand in your shoes,” says Trump Plaza security guard Stanley Smith.
“And once you have it, you can’t get rid of it.
” A city that reinvents itself as often as this one perseveres on the memory of the good old days left behind and the promise of better days ahead.
In a seaside town, there’s always next season.
Now, however, it must deal with an economic crisis.
“You want to talk ripple effects.
” says Frank Formica, an elected county official and owner of a 95-year-old family bakery that supplies some of the casinos.
“The ripple effects are tidal waves.
” Four casinos closed in nine months.
A fifth threatens to close by Thanksgiving.
Almost 8,000 workers got pink slips.
Many of the lost positions were considered good jobs with union-negotiated benefits, and people made careers out of them.
They put themselves and their kids through college and went to the dentist regularly and had their nails done.
You don’t have to think too hard about what the ripple effects might be.
“We have about 800 casino workers living here,” says Egg Harbor Township Mayor James “Sonny” McCullough.
As the casinos started to cut back around 2008, 2009, and started moving toward a part-time workforce, we started seeing a lot of foreclosures.
It still costs the same amount of money to operate a town.
You still have law enforcement, and you still have education.
Sixty-five percent of the budget goes to education.
” Things started going bad in 2007, the year after Pennsylvania opened slots, henceforth known as the Year of No Going Back.
Within four years, Pennsylvania bumped Atlantic City out of second place behind Nevada in annual gaming revenue.
In 2013, Schwartz says, Pennsylvania’s gross gaming revenue was $3.
Almost two-thirds of those winnings came from eastern Pennsylvania — gamblers who otherwise would likely spend their money in Atlantic City.
As Pennsylvania rose, Atlantic City fell from a 2006 peak of $5.
2 billion in gross casino revenues to $2.
Considering that Atlantic City’s long monopoly ended with the start of the Great Recession, bad quickly became worse.
Trump Plaza dealer Ray Ngo pulls his last paycheck from his pocket.
Trump Plaza dealers’ weekly toke rate, the pooled tips they divvy up, fell from a high of $20 an hour to an average of $10 an hour.
In the last full week of business, the toke was $6.
The ripples show up in the 2,091 unemployment insurance claims filed by casino workers after Showboat and Revel closed.
They show up in the more than 1,500 job-seekers who met with 60 employers at the Department of Labor and Workforce Development career fair held at the Atlantic City Convention Center.
The ripples also show up in rising real estate taxes – already among the highest in the country — which Atlantic City has been raising by double digits of late.
Ninety percent of the city’s budget comes from real estate taxes.
In 2010, the city’s total assessed property value was $20.
5 billion, says Michael Stinson, the city’s director of revenue and finance.
3 billion and is heading south.
The majority of that drop is a result of successful appeals by the casinos for reassessments.
Because of the straits the city now finds itself in, Stinson says, federal and state government is kicking in a combined total of about $30 million to help cover essential services including firefighters through the end of the year.
The less money Atlantic City has to contribute toward the county budget, the more the surrounding jurisdictions have had to kick in, meaning they, too, have been raising real estate tax rates.
Frank Formica is chair of the equivalent of Atlantic County’s Board of Supervisors, here called the Board of Chosen Freeholders.
The area he represents includes Atlantic City.
He is also the owner of Formica Bros.
bakery, which bakes 20,000 to 50,000 pieces of bread a day and has nearly 70 employees.
“We delivered somewhere around 2,000 to 3,000 pieces a day to Trump Plaza at its peak,” he says.
“The Atlantic Club was 1,000 a day.
Revel, a couple thousand pieces a day.
” He says he expanded operations into a neighboring county and picked up 100 more accounts over the last five years to try compensate for the loss he feared was coming.
“So, people might say, ‘What’s Formica crying about.
’ I used to deliver the equivalent of those 100 accounts within a mile radius of our bakery to the casinos.
Now, we do it in a 40-mile radius with two extra trucks and drivers that add 180 hours of labor and 1,000 miles of gas, tolls and wear and tear per week.
” But, he says, “from forest fires come new trees.
This is a wakeup call for Atlantic City to become something only it can become.
” “One thing that has never been underscored in what is happening here,” Formica adds, is that “no other city in the U.
will ever be the first exclusive monopoly outside Nevada in the rest of your days.
No other city had a mandated legislative monopoly.
No other city with gaming outside Vegas exploded like Atlantic City, and no other city could implode like it.
We were Vegas’ only competition, and now everyone is our competition.
” Atlantic City is a town of 40,000 people, 48 blocks long, three-quarters of a mile wide at its widest.
Its budget is about $270 million.
About one-third of its residents live in poverty.
More than two-thirds of its adults age 25 and older have a high school diploma or less.
In July, its non-seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 13.
9 percent, more than twice that of New Jersey’s.
The good news is that’s lower than in was in July 2013.
The not-so-good news is that its labor force is shrinking, as well.
Pain is inevitable, Guardian says, though he hopes to avoid mass layoffs in City Hall through attrition.
Guardian is a man with a snap in his stride and a vision for economic diversification that includes turning Atlantic City into a university town, better educating its workforce, extending the boardwalk and creating the equivalent of Baltimore’s Inner Harbor.
It includes a plan to grow the city’s retail base and to diversify the tourist industry to attract a greater range of entertainment and conventions.
“We need to become a real city and not just a Jersey Shore town,” he says.
No one, the mayor says, saw the collapse of four casinos in a single year.
A fifth, the Trump Taj Mahal, is in bankruptcy, with the owners making noises about closing in mid-November if the union doesn’t make some concessions.
The Taj is a colossal property, as was Revel Casino.
Showboat, which sits between them, was no slouch.
One end of the boardwalk would fall into silence should the Taj go, and if there is one thing the boardwalk will not tolerate, it is silence.
The opening bid at this week’s auction is expected to be $90 million.
The city still houses a $2 billion-plus casino industry.
The other local casinos, particularly those at the marina, have seen their revenues rise with the culling, and a few years ago several began to expand into true resort/entertainment facilities.
Plus, as everyone here will tell you with a wide sweep of the arm toward the beach and the sun sparkling off the Atlantic Ocean, “We’ve got this.
” The morning after Trump Plaza closes, a 51-year-old Plaza bartender sits with the 54-year-old Plaza cocktail waitress at a one-stop shop set up by the state Department of Labor and Unite Here, local 54, and helps her apply for her unemployment benefits.
“This is all I know,” she says.
The newly jobless move from station to station, applying for food stamps, if needed, getting information in English, Spanish and Gujuarti on credit counseling, mortgage modification, job training, Social Security and help with the utility bills.
Gonsalves says his wife is a part-time dealer at Borgata, the hot property in the city, and so he’s going to take some time to catch up on projects around the house.
One day, when his little ones are grown, he’ll tell them about the last night at the Plaza and how he dealt the last hand: In the casino’s last hour, only one table is open.
One is the husband of a dealer, and he keeps a steady stream of tips going Gonsalves’ way.
The other is a scruffy guy in a camouflage jacket, who later declares his name classified on a need-to-know basis.
Gonsalves, a miracle to watch with the cards, does his thing.
X proceeds to lose hand after hand through a stream of complaints about how he’d been playing at the Trump Plaza since damn near the beginning of time and how it had been mismanaged into oblivion.
“I’m really here for sentimental reasons, you know,” he says.
“I wanted to play one last sh—y hand in a sh—y casino.
” “Alright, last hand gentlemen,” the casino manager says.
” No one will remember what the two players’ hands show, because Gonsalves shows an ace.

Lent Carnival/Mardi Gras Ash Wednesday The Journey of Lent Reflections on Lent The season of Lent has not been well observed in much of evangelical Christianity, largely because it was associated with "high church" liturgical worship that some churches were eager to reject.
However, much of the background of evangelical Christianity, for example the heritage of John Wesley, was very "high church.
" Many of the churches that had originally rejected more formal and deliberate liturgy are now recovering aspects of a larger Christian tradition as a means to refocus on spirituality in a culture that is increasingly secular.
Originating in the fourth century of the church, the season of Lent spans 40 weekdays beginning on Ash Wednesday and climaxing during Holy Week with Holy Thursday (Maundy Thursday), Good Friday, and concluding Saturday before Easter.
Originally, Lent was the time of preparation for those who were to be baptized, a time of concentrated study and prayer before their baptism at the Easter Vigil, the celebration of the Resurrection of the Lord early on Easter Sunday.
But since these new members were to be received into a living community of Faith, the entire community was called to preparation.
Also, this was the time when those who had been separated from the Church would prepare to rejoin the community.
Today, Lent is marked by a time of prayer and preparation to celebrate Easter.
Since Sundays celebrate the resurrection of Jesus, the six Sundays that occur during Lent are not counted as part of the 40 days of Lent, and are referred to as the Sundays in Lent.
The number 40 is connected with many biblical events, but especially with the forty days Jesus spent in the wilderness preparing for His ministry by facing the temptations that could lead him to abandon his mission and calling.
Christians today use this period of time for introspection, self examination, and repentance.
This season of the year is equal only to the Season of Advent in importance in the Christian year, and is part of the second major grouping of Christian festivals and sacred time that includes Holy Week, Easter, and Pentecost.
Lent has traditionally been marked by penitential prayer, fasting, and almsgiving.
Some churches today still observe a rigid schedule of fasting on certain days during Lent, especially the giving up of meat, alcohol, sweets, and other types of food.
Other traditions do not place as great an emphasis on fasting, but focus on charitable deeds, especially helping those in physical need with food and clothing, or simply the giving of money to charities.
Most Christian churches that observe Lent at all focus on it as a time of prayer, especially penance, repenting for failures and sin as a way to focus on the need for God’s grace.
It is really a preparation to celebrate God’s marvelous redemption at Easter, and the resurrected life that we live, and hope for, as Christians.
Carnival, which comes from a Latin phrase meaning "removal of meat," is the three day period preceding the beginning of Lent, the Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday immediately before Ash Wednesday, which is the first day of the Lenten Season (some traditions count Carnival as the entire period of time between Epiphany and Ash Wednesday).
The three days before Ash Wednesday are also known as Shrovetide ("shrove" is an Old English word meaning "to repent").
The Tuesday just before Ash Wednesday is called Shrove Tuesday, or is more popularly known by the French term Mardi Gras, meaning "Fat Tuesday," contrasting to the fasting during Lent.
The entire three day period has now come to be known in many areas as Mardi Gras.
Carnival or Mardi Gras is usually a period of celebration, originally a festival before the fasting during the season of Lent.
Now it is celebrated in many places with parades, costumes, dancing, and music.
Many Christians’ discomfort with Lent originates with a distaste for Mardi Gras.
In some cultures, especially the Portuguese culture of Brazil, the French culture of Louisiana, and some of the Caribbean cultures such as Trinidad, it has tended to take on the excesses of wild and drunken revelry.
There has been some attempt in recent years to change this aspect of the season, such as using Brazilian Carnival parades to focus on national and cultural history.
Many churches now observe Mardi Gras with a church pancake breakfast or other church meal, eating together as a community before the symbolic fasting of Lent begins.
Ash Wednesday, the seventh Wednesday before Easter Sunday, is the first day of the Season of Lent.
Its name comes from the ancient practice of placing ashes on worshippers’ heads or foreheads as a sign of humility before God, a symbol of mourning and sorrow at the death that sin brings into the world.
It not only prefigures the mourning at the death of Jesus, but also places the worshipper in a position to realize the consequences of sin.
(See Reflections on Ash Wednesday).
Ash Wednesday is a somber day of reflection on what needs to change in our lives if we are to be fully Christian.
In the early church, ashes were not offered to everyone but were only used to mark the forehead of worshippers who had made public confession of sin and sought to be restored to the fellowship of the community at the Easter celebration.
However, over the years others began to show their humility and identification with the penitents by asking that they, too, be marked as sinners.
Finally, the imposition of ashes was extended to the whole congregation in services similar to those that are now observed in many Christian churches on Ash Wednesday.
Ashes became symbolic of that attitude of penitence reflected in the Lord’s prayer: “forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us” (Luke 11:4, NRSV).
The color used in the sanctuary for most of Lent is purple, red violet, or dark violet (see Colors of the Church Year).
These colors symbolize both the pain and suffering leading up to the crucifixion of Jesus as well as the suffering of humanity and the world under sin.
But purple is also the color of royalty, and so anticipates through the suffering and death of Jesus the coming resurrection and hope of newness that will be celebrated in the Resurrection on Easter Sunday.
Some churches use grey for Ash Wednesday or for the entire season of Lent, or for special days of fasting and prayer.
Gray is the color of ashes, and therefore a biblical symbol of mourning and repentance.
The decorations for the sanctuary during Lent should reflect this mood of penitence and reflection.
Some Anglican churches use unbleached muslin, which can range from white to beige, with accents in red or black for Lent to symbolize this same spirit of penitence.
Some churches avoid the use of any flowers in the sanctuary during Lent, using various dried arrangements.
This can be especially effective if a flowering cross is used for Easter.
Other churches use arrangements of rocks or symbols associated with the Gospel readings for the six Sundays in Lent.
Some church traditions change the sanctuary colors to red for Maundy Thursday, a symbol of the disciples and through them the community of the church.
Since Eucharist or communion is often observed on Maundy Thursday in the context of Passover, the emphasis is on the gathered community in the presence of Jesus the Christ.
Traditionally, the sanctuary colors of Good Friday and Holy Saturday are black, the only days of the Church Year that black is used.
It symbolizes the darkness brought into the world by sin.
It also symbolizes death, not only the death of Jesus but the death of the whole world under the burden of sin.
In this sense, it also represents the hopelessness and the endings that come as human beings try to make their own way in the world without God (see The Days of Holy Week).
Black is always replaced by white before sunrise of Easter Sunday.
There are many ways for a congregation to mark the journey of Lent.
Of course, beginning with a service of worship for Ash Wednesday is always appropriate (see Ash Wednesday: A Service of Worship).
During Lent, one of the most effective visual reminders of the season that can be expanded in many variations is to use a rough wooden cross as a focal point in the sanctuary.
The type of cross and how it is constructed will depend on exactly how it will be used.
The cross is usually erected in the Sanctuary on Ash Wednesday as a visible symbol of the beginning of Lent.
It is usually draped in black on Good Friday.
The same cross can also become a part of the congregation's Easter celebration as it is then draped in white or gold, or covered with flowers (see The Flowering Cross).
One effective way to make use of the cross is to use it as a Prayer Cross during Lent.
A hammer, square nails, and small pieces of paper are made available near the cross.
At a designated time of prayer during the Sundays in Lent, or beginning with Ash Wednesday, people are invited to write their prayer requests on the paper, and then nail them to the cross.
The quiet time of prayer with only the sounds of the hammer striking the nails can be a moving time for reflection on the meaning of Lent, and a powerful call to prayer.
The prayer requests can be removed and burned as part of a Tenebrae or Stations of the Cross service during Holy Week to symbolize releasing the needs to God.
Some churches have a special time of prayer or meditation one night of each week during Lent.
Often Catholic and high church traditions pray the Stations of the Cross (see The Fourteen Stations of the Cross).
Some Protestant churches have a special series of weekly Bible studies followed by a time of meditation and prayer.
Often, in both Catholic and Protestant traditions, the prayer time is followed by a simple meal of soup and bread to symbolize the penitence of the Season.
We enjoy celebrating Palm Sunday.
The children get to make paper palm branches and for many it is one of the few times they get to take an active role in "big church.
" We wave the palm branches and celebrate.
It is a happy time, with flowers, new clothes, and the expectation of Spring in the air.
Yet there is something significant missing if we only concentrate on celebration for these two Sundays.
It is too easy and promotes much too cheap a grace to focus only on the high points of Palm Sunday and Easter without walking with Jesus through the gathering shadows of Maundy Thursday and the darkness of Good Friday.
For us, that journey begins on Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent.
Lent is a way to recall a larger story than just celebration.
It is a way to face the reality of the consequences of sin and the terrible toll it takes on the world.
Lent calls us to examine our own lives with the prayer, “Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my thoughts.
See if there is any wicked way in me (Psa 139:23-24).
The journey through Lent is a way to places ourselves before God humbled, bringing in our hands no price whereby we can ourselves purchase our salvation.
It is a way to confess our total inadequacy before God, to strip ourselves bare of all pretenses to righteousness, to come before God in dust and ashes.
It is a way to empty ourselves of our false pride, of our rationalizations that prevent us from seeing ourselves as needy creatures, of our external piety that blinds us to the beam in our own eyes.
Through prayer that gives up self, we seek to open ourselves up before God, and to hear anew the call "Come unto me.
" We seek to recognize and respond afresh to God’s presence in our lives and in our world.
We seek to place our needs, our fears, our failures, our hopes, our very lives in God’s hands, again.
And we seek by abandoning ourselves in Jesus’ death to recognize again who God is, to allow His transforming grace to work in us once more, and to come to worship Him on Easter Sunday with a fresh victory and hope that goes beyond the new clothes, the Spring flowers, the happy music.
Yet, that celebration begins in ashes.
And it journeys though darkness.
It is a spiritual pilgrimage that I am convinced we must all make, one way or the other, for genuine spiritual renewal to come.
I have heard the passage in 2 Chronicles 7:14 quoted a lot: ".
if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.
" This usually is quoted in the context of wanting revival or renewal in the church.
The prayer is usually interpreted as intercessory prayer for others, since we too easily assume that any problem lies with someone else.
Yet a careful reading of the passage will reveal that the prayer that is called for here is not intercessory prayer for others; it is penitential prayer for the faith community, for us.
It is not to call for others to repent; it is a call for us, God’s people, to repent.
It is our land that needs healed, it is our wicked ways from which we need to turn, we are the ones who need to seek God’s face.
Perhaps during the Lenten season we should stop praying for others as if we were virtuous enough to do so.
Perhaps we should take off our righteous robes just long enough during these 40 days to put ashes on our own heads, to come before God with a new humility that is willing to confess, "Lord, be merciful to me, a sinner.
" Maybe we should be willing to prostrate ourselves before God and plead, "Lord, in my hand no price I bring; simply to the cross I cling.
" That might put us in a position to hear God in ways that we have not heard Him in a long time.
And it may be the beginning of that healing for which we have so longed.

From The Brooklyn Paper: Angry Greenpointers are planning to sue the city and developers over two planned waterfront luxury apartment complexes that they say are steam-rolling over environmental protections.
The ad hoc group announced the suit at a rally against the Greenpoint Landing and 77 Commercial Street developments on Wednesday night.
Council candidate Stephen Pierson was on hand to tell the crowd of 75 protesters that he will spearhead the lawsuit with the goal of stopping the 12 towers from rising.
“This is not right, and [the developer] should not go unchallenged,” said Pierson.
The legal action would be based on the city’s decision that the developments — a 10 tower compound with as many as 5,500 apartments and a two tower neighbor with a total of 720 at the Newtown Creek end of Greenpoint — would have no negative environmental impact.
The anti-high-rise group says the findings are based on a study that is eight years old, running afoul of a requirement that the city make decisions based on accurate information.
“[The developers] might claim that they have updated a few things,” said Pierson.
“But if they had done anything significant, they would have published it.
” The energetic crowd toted signs bearing messages such as “The roof is too damn high” and “Greenpoint does not equal Midtown.
” Protesters said they fear a repeat of the massive condo skyscrapers lining Williamsburg’s waterfront, which activists decried for increasing rents and failing on promises to expand parks, but failed to prevent from rising.
Pierson said that even if the Article 78 lawsuit does not hit its mark, it will buy neighbors time until a new mayor takes office, which could be a crucial factor in the battle against the project.
“Even if we lose, we can tie it up until we get a new mayoral administration that might be more sympathetic,” said Pierson “Bloomberg was setting the bar [for developers] very low.

When her two children go to bed, Christina Gilchrist watches them via a baby video monitor.
However, her kids aren’t babies anymore: Her daughter is 3 years old, and her son is approaching 2.
“It’s super cute to watch them and how they interact without us there,” said Ms.
Gilchrist, who lives in San Francisco and has witnessed sweet nighttime moments like her daughter “reading” a book to herself or singing to her brother.
“I would never know she did that if it wasn’t for the video monitor.
Gilchrist isn’t the only parent watching her kids in bed remotely long past the baby stage.
As video monitors have become cheaper, smaller and more secure over the last decade, they’ve also become increasingly ubiquitous, surpassing audio monitors in sales, and changing parental monitoring behaviors in the process.
While parents of the past tended to use audio monitors only until their babies slept through the night or could call out to mommy and daddy, many moms and dads today (me included) are using video monitors well beyond those milestones.
“Parents are using video monitors for a longer period of time,” said Julie Dodge, product manager for Summer Infant’s monitor line.
Dodge, parents tend to stop video monitoring in a bedroom when their child is on average about 3 or 4, up from about 12 months old for audio monitoring.
Beyond the peace of mind and potential safety benefits that come from extended use of video monitors, many moms and dads would agree that “it’s more fascinating” to watch your child via a video monitor than to listen to him or her via audio, said Alan Fields, co-author of the baby gear review book “Baby Bargains” and the “Best Baby Monitors” online guide.
The early audio monitor was a way for parents to hear remotely when their baby woke up, but video monitors let parents see what their baby is doing when they’re not there.
But while it’s fun to watch kids entertain themselves, long-term monitoring may be contributing to the creation of a future generation that’s used to being in the spotlight and to having little privacy.
Many young children, it turns out, realize that they’re being watched by their parents, or at least by a camera.
Gilchrist’s 3-year-old daughter, Abby, is among them.
On a recent Saturday morning, Abby pointed out the camera in her room.
“It’s used for Mommy and Daddy, so if I bang, they are going to talk through the camera,” she said.
Gilchrist tells her two little ones to be quiet via the monitor’s talk feature when they start their nightly chatting, screaming and banging on the walls.
) According to Jean Twenge, author of “Generation Me,” college students have become more narcissistic over the last couple of decades, and growing up being watched by a bedroom camera (along with being constantly photographed) could help continue this trend.
Video monitors may also make future generations more accepting of being watched by police and security cameras.
“You get used to something growing up and you just accept it as the way the world works,” said Dr.
Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University.
In the nearer term, extended monitoring can have another unintended consequence: sleep deprivation.
My husband wakes up a number of times each night to check the video monitor and make sure our 2-year-old daughter is still sleeping — she generally is — and he’s not alone.
Some parents “become a little compulsive about the video monitor,” said Nicole Johnson, a sleep coach and founder of The Baby Sleep Site.
“They feel like they need to keep checking to make sure baby is okay.
I once worked with a family whose child was sleeping great, but mom would wake up and check the monitor virtually all night.
I tell parents that if the monitor is doing more harm than good in their home, it’s best to get rid of it.
” So, when should parents stop using video monitors.
The answers vary, but Judith Owens, director of sleep medicine at Children’s National Medical Center in Washington and a consultant with the American Academy of Pediatrics, said she doesn’t see any utility in using the monitors once healthy children are ambulatory, though those with certain sleep problems or illnesses may need longer or interim monitoring.
In the case of the normal healthy baby, monitoring past 12 to 15 months “is really probably unnecessary,” Dr.
Owens said, adding that if children “are old enough to recognize that they are being watched on the video monitor, then it’s probably time to stop.

Charts Way to Build #7 Line Without Using MTA Funds, Also Lays Out Plan to Nearly Double Size of Javits Center Schumer: We Can and Must Do Both, Build Downtown and Far West Side Today Senator Schumer laid out his vision for the West Side in a major speech to business leaders from the Partnership for New York City.
He discussed how New York City's creeping "culture of inertia" could overwhelm the necessity of Far West Side development and put forth new thoughts and ideas on what should be done to move forward now that the stadium has been rejected.
Schumer initiated the original Group of 35 that targeted far West Side for commercial/residential growth.
Introduction – Is the #7 Extension and Future Commercial Development of the West Side In Jeopardy.
Good morning, I’d like to talk about something very important to us all today – the future development of the West Side and the overall economic growth of our City.
I’ve spoken on this topic before, but I am compelled to speak out right now in the wake of the Public Authorities Control Board’s rejection of the new stadium and because the MTA has recently submitted their current five-year capital plan for approval by the MTA Capital Program Review Board.
The Board is expected to approve or disapprove the MTA capital plan any day now.
Recently we have heard whispers that the CPRB, which consists of representatives appointed by Governor Pataki, Mayor Bloomberg, Majority Leader Bruno and Speaker Silver, may not agree to approve the extension of the #7 subway line to the Far West Side.
We hear that there are concerns that both the City and the MTA are overextended and that the commercial development the #7 will spur on the far West Side isn’t needed right now, or will compete with the rebuilding of Downtown.
I believe the #7 line should and must be approved and I want to urge the members of the Board to approve the extension of the #7 and the MTA’s entire capital plan to keep the momentum going for the redevelopment of the Far West Side.
I was religiously agnostic on the West Side Stadium because I felt it was so important that the other parts of the plan – the rezoning, expansion of the Javits Center and extension of the #7 line – happen, regardless of the stadium controversy.
And so I chose to work with both sides – Mayor Bloomberg and Deputy Mayor Doctoroff, who were pushing the stadium, as well as Speaker Miller and other Council members, some of who opposed the stadium – to keep momentum going on the plan overall.
The stadium debate is over now and we have come to a fork in the road.
We can continue to delay projects -- critical projects like the #7, turn our backs on the future, and feed the culture of inertia or we can move forward.
Public transportation is what separates New York from almost every other American city.
It is the reason that our city is growing once again in the 21st century.
Mass transit allows our city greater density of population than any other in our country and with it comes a density of job opportunities, economic cross-fertilization, cultural, educational and social opportunities.
It is this very density, which only mass transit allows, that has always allowed our city to attract the wealthy, the middle class, and the poor, all seeking one or more of these opportunities.
The density that mass transit facilitates is even more important to attracting these groups in our 21st Century information age society.
It comes as no surprise then that the history of the City of New York teaches us that development follows subways.
The Hudson Rail Yards is the last significant developable parcel in Midtown Manhattan and building the #7 extension will light a stick of development dynamite under the Far West Side.
We must summon up not only the will to pursue the #7, rebuild Downtown, and pursue other grand plans, but I believe we must also commit more public dollars to large transportation-oriented public works.
New York faces stiff economic competition from other U.
cities and major cities across the globe and we need to invest in our own economic future.
To do so we must push ahead with our long term goals – unlocking the potential of the less developed parts of the City like the Far West Side – while continuing the most vital work of rebuilding Downtown.
The late Senator Pat Moynihan used to observe that while New York receives a lot of what he termed “disaster relief” from the Federal government – welfare, Medicaid and Section 8 housing dollars – we do not receive enough Federal dollars for things that generate economic activity and create jobs, like transportation and military bases.
And just as Pat Moynihan fought to bring New York major transportation dollars, I have joined with our entire delegation in the fight to ensure that New York gets its fair share of Federal transportation funding.
The House and Senate are currently in conference on the next major Federal transportation bill and we do not yet know what the final allocations will be.
But even though Pat Moynihan is no longer here with us, New York will still do well.
Our highway funding will likely increase around 20 percent to over $10 billion for the next six years.
Our transit funding will increase well over 30 percent, providing at least $6 billion for the next six years.
And in addition to those formula funds, New York will receive hundreds of millions in project earmarks.
But to realize all the important projects we need, we must also boost our own capital investments at the City and State level.
We used to be a City that was willing to make major investments in our economic future, but we have let inertia set in and a reluctance to make the fiscal sacrifices needed to build a better future for our City and the generations of New Yorkers to come.
As many of you here recall, several years ago I helped create a task force, called the "Group of 35," which I chaired with former Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin.
It included chief executives and leaders in business, real estate, academia, labor and government.
At that time, New York's real estate market was booming and the Group's mission was to identify areas within the City where we could build new office space to both attract and retain businesses.
When the Group released its report in June of 2001, it projected the City would need 60 million square feet of new office space by 2020 to keep pace with projected job growth of almost 300,000 new office sector jobs.
The Group's main recommendation was the creation of three new and expanded "Central Business Districts" in Downtown Brooklyn, Long Island City and the Far West Side of Manhattan.
For the Far West Side, the Group specifically proposed creating at least 20 million square feet of new office space within the area west of 9th Avenue between 28th and 42nd Streets, expanding the Javits Center, rezoning the area, assembling development sites, creating open space and pedestrian-friendly corridors, creating an Urban Business Campus, and most importantly extending the #7 Line to connect with Grand Central, Penn Station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
The #7 line extension was to be the base upon which the other recommendations would successfully take root.
When the Group of 35 report, entitled "Preparing for the Future: A Commercial Development Strategy for New York City," was released in June of 2001, there was general agreement that many of recommendations were urgently needed and both the public and private sectors should create a partnership to pursue them.
Three months later our City was attacked and the country's economy started to slow, with New York being especially hard hit.
Naturally and correctly, the recovery and rebuilding of Lower Manhattan became the focus for so many of us.
In Congress we worked to obtain the $20 billion in funds needed to rebuild the City and that process continues today as we seek to get the last piece of that funding, $2 billion for the Downtown/JFK Airport Rail Link.
But as we all know, New York is estimated to have lost approximately 250,000 jobs after 9/11 and I, and so many others, have made it our number one mission to help the City not only recover all the jobs lost after that horrible, tragic day, but grow and create even more jobs.
History has shown that if New York City doesn’t grow, it dies.
Those who say New York’s only goal and focus should be only bringing us back to where we were on September 10, 2001 do not appreciate New York’s glorious past and our potential for an even greater future.
Three-and-a-half years after 9/11, my focus on job creation has only grown stronger, as I have seen too many New Yorkers still out of work and still in need of our help.
Every 40 years or so New York sheds its skin with a burst of public and private investment in transportation infrastructure.
At the turn of the last century, New York built much of its remarkable subway system, which helped make the City one of the world's greatest.
In the 1940s, '50s and early '60s, Robert Moses was responsible for a massive expansion of New York's transportation infrastructure, until New Yorkers finally rebelled against his refusal to address the human costs of his projects.
Nevertheless, Moses helped further build the New York region into an economic powerhouse.
Now, as the 21st century dawns, New York must once again make major investments in its transportation system which will fuel the region's economic growth for the coming decades.
Between 1990 and 2000, New York City's population grew by about 800,000 people and the metropolitan area grew by over 1 million people, more growth than our region had seen in decades.
And that growth is being fueled largely by two dynamic groups of people – new immigrants from all over the world and creative, well-educated, young people, flocking to New York from all over the country.
Both groups of newcomers have spurred a fantastic renaissance of so many of our City's neighborhoods – Harlem, Green Point, Williamsburg, DUMBO, Red Hook, Bedford-Stuyvesant and even the South Bronx.
To make sure these newcomers succeed, our City must grow and must create new jobs.
Much of our present growth is being fueled by this influx of newcomers and the concomitant residential real estate boom they create.
But if they cannot find good paying jobs they and their successors will leave And I believe that we cannot create significant new and good paying jobs without significant new investments in transportation.
Without them we will literally and economically stand still.
And in today's competitive economy, to stand still, as I said, is to die.
I believe we have a rare moment here in New York – we have strong political consensus on a number of key transportation projects needed for our region, including East Side Access, Second Avenue Subway, linking Lower Manhattan with Kennedy Airport , extending the #7 Line to the far West Side, and the cross-harbor freight rail tunnel.
And right now, fortuitously, funding for these projects can be found in a number of different pots – the reauthorization of TEA-21 and the annual Federal Transportation Appropriations process, our remaining September 11 funding, and bonding future revenues from the Far West Side.
It is especially remarkable in that the City has not built a new rail line for 60 years, despite all the growth we have experienced.
In so many ways we have never been more ready to expand our City’s transportation network, but I am fearful that there is a certain culture of inertia creeping into City’s efforts.
That culture of inertia threatens to mar this grand experiment of the possible that we call New York City.
Criticism predominates over construction; critics are given more weight than those trying to build and we all find it far too easy to second-guess every decision -- in political circles, in the news media, and in the public debate.
We’ve always been a City that loves free-thinking criticism, but it’s always been countered by a “can do” spirit.
The culture of criticism doesn’t completely stop New York from growing because of capitalism.
Someone can go ahead and build a small business or even a skyscraper on his or her own.
The goal to make money overcomes the culture of criticism.
But when it comes to large public works, where the profit motive vanishes and public pressure has great effect, we seem paralyzed and lacking in confidence.
That is why there can be no “either/or” question of Downtown vs.
We can’t choose one over the other or let one area lay fallow until the other is completed.
I say this as someone who has devoted some portion of nearly every day of my life for the last three and a half years to helping our City rebuild and triumph from the devastating attack of 9/11.
To insure our City’s future success it is our duty to see that our City continues to meet future economic demand and provide choices for employers and residents.
Developers, companies, residents will each have their own needs and preferences for location, space and amenities.
Some will be better served Downtown and some on the Far West Side.
If New York is to keep growing and thriving, we must be ready to provide the broadest menu of options for employers and residents alike.
Providing several different venues and then letting businesses and residents decide which they prefer is the tried and true free market way of New York and America.
To simply have government choose one place and tell businesses and residents to take it or leave it will not inure to New York’s long term benefit.
That is why I was so delighted when Mayor Bloomberg and Deputy Mayor Doctor off embraced so many of the Group of 35's recommendations for the Far West Side and became such big boosters of that area’s potential.
I want to compliment the Mayor and his team on their efforts so far, which I firmly believe will spur job creation, new housing development and benefit the entire City and metropolitan region.
I also want to compliment Speaker Giff Miller and the members of the City Council, who not only provided their strong support back in January for much of the Mayor’s proposal, but made many improvements to the City’s plan.
Thanks to the Council’s work, the project’s overall cost was reduced by $1 billion and significantly more affordable housing for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers was added to the mix.
While agreement could not be reached on the stadium, the teamwork of the entire City on the rest of the plan has already produced exciting results.
The rezoning of the 42-black area west of Eighth Avenue for large-scale development, has spurred widespread developer interest.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that land prices in the area have more than doubled and developers are planning to build large new residential buildings, a 1,500-room hotel and even some commercial property.
I also agree that the renovation and expansion of the Javits Center from its current 790,000 square feet to eventually 1.
75 million square feet is long overdue and will have clear and immediate economic benefits to the entire region.
New York City has been missing out on some of the largest and most lucrative conventions and trade shows.
New York City reports that the Javits Center is currently unable to host the 60 largest conventions and trade shows in the United States.
And there are also many smaller conventions that bypass Javits due to its lack of meeting rooms.
The current proposed expansion will increase the number of meeting rooms tenfold and enable New York to attract the type of conventions, like the American Federation of Teachers or the American Veterinary Medical Association, that each account for over 15,000 hotel room nights and all the spending, from Broadway shows to restaurants to shopping, that accompanies those visitors.
And I hardly need to tell this audience what the impact of that spending is – jobs and tax revenues for the City.
But now that the stadium project, which would have included a large plenary space for conventions, is off the table, I believe it is worth revisiting the Javits expansion design and considering adding more space, possibly on the former stadium site over the Western Rail Yards.
Plans for the stadium limited Javits to 1.
and only northward growth; with the rejection of the stadium we can think more grandly.
The convention business is fast-moving and competitive and we need to build in anticipation of where it is headed.
Many other cities – Chicago, Orlando, Las Vegas, and Atlanta, for example – have invested far more in their convention infrastructure.
Why not consider expanding the Javits Center even further, perhaps to as much as 3 million square feet, which would make us the largest convention center in the United States.
Why shouldn’t New York become the number one destination for both U.
Medium-sized cities and their convention centers may be struggling, but we are in a different league.
People the world over want to come to New York.
Given the attractions of our city we can become the number one convention city for the world.
And if the current convention center expansion may add 10 or 15 hotels, just imagine what a 3 million square foot project could do.
The hotel jobs alone, which are such an important “ladder” into the workplace for low-income and immigrant workers, would be worth benefit to our growing City.
And just as we should think big on the Javits Center, we must think big on transportation, which will always be the most important driver of economic growth of our City, our region, and our State.
As Senator, I have seen not only how a project like East Side Access or a Downtown link to JFK could spur economic growth in our region, but I have seen what a dramatic effect JetBlue's low-cost flights from Kennedy Airport to Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse have had on Upstate's economy or the exciting promise of the Rochester-to-Toronto fast ferry.
And so to slow down or deny the necessary support for the #7 line extension would be shortsighted, and feed the dangerous culture of inertia that threatens to subsume our City’s appetite for grand public works projects.
What the Critics Are Saying Many thoughtful people have raised good questions about the need to extend the #7 line and where it fits into the City’s overall financial and economic development plans.
We should certainly address their arguments.
The chief concern raised is that investing in the #7 will spur commercial development in the Far West Side at the expense of Downtown.
I certainly share the fear that many have that we are losing our focus on Downtown.
The plans for a Goldman Sachs headquarters are on hold and security concerns threaten to bog down the Freedom Tower and other projects.
And I have called on the Mayor, Governor and all our civic and business leaders to break the culture of inertia that seemed to envelop downtown rebuilding and to rededicate themselves to revitalizing Downtown.
That is a clear moral imperative for us all.
But I refuse to believe that this great City of eight million people cannot do the equivalent of walking and chewing gum at the same time – rebuild Downtown while also redeveloping the Far West Side.
At the dawn of the last century, we built a subway system and grand public works like Grand Central Station.
In the 1930s through 1960s we built a city highway system, Lincoln Center, and the World Trade Center.
But there hasn't been a major public work built in this city for 50 years.
Surely we can do both Downtown and the West Side.
Others take issue with different elements of the City’s and MTA’s financing proposal.
Because neither the City nor the MTA can afford any more direct capital investments, this project relies on the creation of a new entity, the Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation (HYIC), to float approximately $3 billion in bonds to fund the #7, construction of the platform over the Eastern Rail Yards, and creation of open space and streetscape improvements.
HYIC’s bonds will be largely supported by allowing developers to purchase additional development rights and through an innovative type of financing known as “value capture,” which closely resembles tax increment financing.
Instead of collecting property taxes on new development in the area, the City will actually take ownership of any new buildings and lease them to developers for 30 years.
While the #7 extension and the platform over the Eastern Rail Yards are being built, the City will cover the debt service for the bonds for a total estimated cost of around $1 billion over 10 years.
Once developers start putting up projects, they will then make payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTs) and those payments will back the HYIC bonds and eventually provide the City with additional revenues.
The City has discretion in the PILOTs it charges the developers and can offer them a substantial discount over what they would pay in property taxes as an incentive.
Let me say right here that I think the “value capture” financing plan that the City created will succeed and Speaker Miller and the City Council deserve credit for shaving $1 billion off the costs of the original version.
But I do not believe we need to give developers tax breaks -- the reduced PILOTS -- to get them to the West Side.
That money should be used for the building of the #7 line if needed.
There is already growing developer interest in the area and I see no evidence that reductions in PILOT payments – de facto tax breaks at the City’s expense – are needed.
Traditionally in this City, infrastructure alone is sufficient to induce development.
In the early part of the last century, when the City announced it was building the IRT subway line in the Bronx, the Grand Concourse was bought up and developed within a year.
I expect the similar interest on the Far West Side.
Once developers believe the #7 line expansion is for real they will flock to the area and property values and concomitant property tax collections will soar.
As far as I am concerned, the #7 line IS the subsidy for that development and West Side developers should pay “full fare.
” The funds saved can be plowed back into the #7 line construction if overruns develop, or if not needed for the #7, into infrastructure investments elsewhere that benefit everyone.
Generally, the City does best when it creates favorable conditions for development – adequate transportation and city services -- and lets the market decide who comes to the table, rather than pick winners and losers with individual incentive packages.
And by not offering extraordinary inducements to developers in the Far West Side, the City also ensures that our development efforts for Downtown will succeed.
Downtown, which must overcome unique security concerns in the wake of 9/11, is the natural choice for providing deep tax incentives to lure employers in.
I agree with those, such as Speaker Silver, who have said that we must provide extra assistance to businesses locating Downtown.
We do not need to and should not provide similar breaks for businesses that locate on the Far West Side.
There are also those that argue that we do not need to worry about the commercial development of the Far West Side now, the demand for office space is low citywide and residential development will be sufficient for now.
But in truth, the timelines differ for the two areas and over the coming years, as New York City continues to grow, there will be enough demand for office space both on the West Side and in Lower Manhattan.
These two important areas of the City do not have to compete.
Many of the Lower Manhattan infrastructure projects are ready to start soon – the Santiago Calatrava PATH terminal and the MTA’s redesigned Fulton Center – and, we hope the Goldman Sachs building and other buildings on the World Trade Center site will commence construction soon.
By comparison, the MTA would not start construction on the #7 line extension until 2006 and we wouldn’t expect to see a new commercial building until 2010 or 2011.
New York City’s latest estimate, assuming that the metropolitan region grows at its past rate of 1.
4 percent per year, is that the City will need 68 million sq.
of Class A office space by 2025.
We can expect to build around 14 million sq.
in Lower Manhattan and another 24 million sq.
So even if we fully develop both areas, we will still need another 30 million sq.
just to keep up with current growth rates over the next 20 years.
And if we fail to keep building at a healthy pace, we may find ourselves making the same mistake we made during the 1990s, when high vacancy rates and a lack of large developable sites led us to all but stop building large new developments.
We all know what happened, from 1991 to 2003.
Demand for space increased dramatically, there was a shortage of parcels for development, and the price for office space in Manhattan skyrocketed.
As a result many new developers and businesses who wanted to stay in New York but could not afford it, went elsewhere.
Northern New Jersey added 19 million sq.
of office space and lured quite a few businesses across the Hudson.
Tens of thousands of other jobs went to more distant locations, like Tampa and Dallas and beyond.
And while we can build new space for new and expanding businesses, the jobs lost to New Jersey and other locations are not coming back.
Building the #7 will avoid this problem from repeating itself as the City starts growing again.
The availability of new parcels on the Far West Side will increase supply – lack of new sites and their stratospheric costs is the number one hindrance to new development in the City.
In 2015 instead of prime office space costing, for example, $120 a square foot, it will only cost $95, keeping prime space affordable and keeping jobs growing.
Thus the #7 line expansion will do more to retain and attract jobs to our City than individual tax breaks aimed scattershot at select companies seeking to locate on the far west side.
The combination of tax breaks going to Downtown only, and the West Side getting the #7 line, is serendipitously complementary.
The other question about the “value capture” financing plan is whether it will offer sufficient safeguards for the MTA’s budget and ensure that the extension of the #7 does not compete with other key priorities such as East Side Access and Second Avenue Subway.
I would submit that if done right, expansion of the #7 line will not interfere with other mass transit priorities.
Given the precarious state of the MTA’s finances, and its earlier willingness to sell off the development rights to Hudson Rail Yards without a competitive bidding process, it is certainly legitimate to question the details of the City’s proposal for extending the #7.
The MTA’s Capital Plan says that the City will cover 100 percent of the $2 billion cost of extending the #7, but the details are a bit more complex than that.
Two issues have not yet been resolved that could potentially cost the MTA money – development of the Eastern Rail Yards and coverage of potential project cost overruns.
It is especially important that the City make a commitment that the extension of the #7 does not drain funds away from other MTA priorities.
While I believe the “value capture” financing plan should cover the costs of the #7 extension and other infrastructure improvements, the City should have a backup plan if there are unforeseen cost overruns.
The city can and should pledge what may be one billion in the reduced PILOT tax breaks to construction of the #7 instead should there be cost overruns.
The MTA should pledge the dollar from the sale of air rights over the East Rail Yards to go to the #7 as well if they are needed.
And as a last resort, we should consider an increase in the hotel tax, should the #7 project’s costs skyrocket.
The extension of the #7 will produce clear and quantifiable benefits for the hotel industry as it makes the convention center and the City in general more of a destination for visitors around the world.
The industry should pledge some of those benefits back if they are needed.
The MTA has serious capital financing problems with both keeping its existing stock in good shape and in building important new projects like East Side Access and the Second Avenue Subway.
I believe the City, State, and Federal governments should be doing more to help the MTA out with this large and important problem.
But those very real and equally important problems should not be an excuse to holding up the #7 line.
The #7 line project can and will be a tub that floats on its own bottom and pays its own way.
With “value capture” financing, asking developers to pay their full PILOTs, the increased proceeds from the East Rail Yards airspace, and, as a last resort a temporary increase in the hotel tax, the #7 will pay its own way.
It should not interfere with MTA financing of other needs, like East Side Access and Second Avenue Subway.
As I have also said recently, I am fearful that there is a certain culture of inertia creeping into City’s recent efforts at public works projects.
I am also fearful that as a City and region, we are no longer willing to make the public investments necessary to foster economic growth.
Throughout our City’s history, development and economic growth have followed the same pattern – we build a subway line and businesses and jobs follow.
We are now about to determine the fate of that #7 line, and subsequently, the fate of the whole Far West Side Central Business District.
Once again, I call on the MTA Capital Program Review Board to approve the Agency’s capital plan and for all of us to join together to do whatever it takes to move the #7 line extension and all our other important priorities forward.
To do otherwise would be shortsighted, and feed the dangerous culture of inertia that threatens to subsume our City’s appetite for grand public works projects.
Two types of pericarditis can occur after a heart attack.
Early pericarditis most often occurs within 1 to 3 days after a heart attack.
When the body tries to clean up the diseased heart tissue, swelling and inflammation occur.
Late pericarditis is also called Dressler syndrome (or post-cardiac injury syndrome or postcardiotomy pericarditis).
It usually occurs several weeks or months after a heart attack, heart surgery, or other trauma to the heart.
However, it may happen a week after a heart injury.
Dressler syndrome is believed to be caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy heart tissue.
You have a higher risk of pericarditis if you have had a previous heart attack, open heart surgery, or chest trauma, or if your heat attack affected the thickness of your heart muscle.

27 of 31 people found the following review helpful (Western Hemisphere) - See all my reviews This review is from: Inside the Dream Palace: The Life and Times of New York's Legendary Chelsea Hotel (Hardcover) Curious to no end regarding the famous, or infamous, depending on the period of time of the many occurrences that took place at the Chelsea Hotel throughout, I looked forward to this book: Inside the Dream Palace: The Life and Times of New York's Legendary Chelsea Hotel, by a very good writer named Sherill Tippins.
To begin with: her command of the language, the number of words I was forced to look at twice, her vast knowledge on the subject, and of course the flow of countless of individuals, characters that lived under such a massive structure, making the place a true unique habitat, make for a serious intriguing read.
For some bizarre reason I compared it briefly to the Overlook Hotel from the movie The Shinning, but the Chelsea Hotel, as opposed to the scary empty one in the movie, had so many people of caliber inside its walls, it has created its very own ghost stories today.
I will not attempt to even bring forth a few of the names that sought residence at the Chelsea, but sufficient is to say that there are more than enough to make for a very and varied compelling read.
Perhaps that would be my only criticism of this juicy book, too many characters interloping, not one lasting more than a few pages, as the book moves along from the inception of this hotel, once believed to be the very best of New York living almost to the present days.
The abundance of characters, and the passage of time, makes this book one rich experience, so many anecdotes, glimpses at a society that definitely exalted the arts in general, for there were all kinds of talented people roaming the halls, day or night, I am sure.
Is like a slide show with narrative of the glorious, and then not so glorious days of such a legendary building.
I found the book more like a train leaving the very first stop, into a never ending road of characters and situations, more entering as others left, and some of the stories truly memorable, especially from the strong poetic population, but not to disregard those of the musicians, captains of industry, directors, writers, etc.
When you have a combination of a great writer, and an extensive subject matter that happens to be all true, you just catch a ride that is truly enjoyable and haunting at the same time.
What a unique place, the Chelsea Hotel.
Really thanking Amazon for allowing me to read this enthralling book, making me wonder how much would I have given to sublet for a couple of months, or perhaps even more, it don't matter if it was one of the smaller rooms, those that were brought to existence when the hotel was renovated, to increase the number of possible rooms, from the once opulent rooms it was originally known for.

I would have liked one of the beautiful, original eighty apartments along with the free thinking, artistic neighbors in the Chelsea Association which later became the Chelsea Hotel.
The Chelsea was inspired in part by Charles Fourier, a French utopian writer.
The idea was to design an urban environment that would attract artists, intellectuals and progressives who would work in a setting that could inspire creativity and tolerance.
The original apartments were designed both for those with wealth and also those with more limited means.
Inside the Dream Palace describes the community that flowered within the walls of the Chelsea for over a hundred years.
The lives of musicians, writers, artists and actors are chronicled, framed by the New York City in which they lived.
Thomas Wolfe, Mark Twain, Bob Dylan, Patti Smith, Robert Mapplethorpe, Gore Vidal, Edie Sedgwick, Sid Vicious and Arthur Miller, along with many others, make appearances.
The influence of the artists on each other both creative and destructive makes an interesting read.
Through the years they offered each other inspiration and support as well as possibly a bit too much sex, alcohol and drugs.
Their concerns over income inequality, recessions/depressions and unpopular wars and foreign involvements unfortunately sounded very current.
Tourists, drug dealers, prostitutes, murderers, along with the eccentric and those just attracted to the action, all fill out the story.
It is a fascinating, unusual history with the Chelsea as the main character.
This book will appeal to anyone interested in the creative life, urban planning, sociology, architecture, history and New York City.
The next time I am in town I plan to find the Chelsea, stand at the front door, and have my picture taken.

The Chelsea Hotel has surely housed more talented, innovative and fascinating people than any other residence on earth.
I read Ed Hamilton's wonderful book "Legends of the Chelsea Hotel" a few years ago and came to appreciate the incredible quirkiness of the Chelsea, but Tippins' new book expands on Hamilton's entertaining book to give us a fuller view of the historical importance of the Chelsea.
Tippins' research is obviously exhaustive and her integrity as a writer is at the top of the heap.
I'm a librarian and I can't recall the last time I have been this impressed with the scholarly research that went into creating this work.
There are many tall tales about the Chelsea that are not completely true, and Tippins does not include any of the unproven tales.
As big as this book is, I can't help but hope for a second volume.
There are so many interesting tales to tell about the Chelsea that I bet Tippins could fill up another huge book or two.
I selfishly hope she will go for Volume 2 of "Inside the Dream Palace" one day.
6 of 6 people found the following review helpful (Boston, MA USA) - See all my reviews This review is from: Inside the Dream Palace: The Life and Times of New York's Legendary Chelsea Hotel (Hardcover) People who share a common vision or destiny are strengthened by forming communities in which their work and beliefs are supported and sustained.
Many of these movements are religiously based such as the Amish, Mennonites, or Hare Krishnas.
Secular movements that adopt a community-based lifestyle are harder to maintain on a broad scale because competing interests - like sex, money, and power - make coalescing around a common core more complicated.
The Chelsea Hotel was a unique and beautiful exception to this rule.
Despite vast differences in race and gender, age and income, education and experience, money and power, the Chelsea Hotel community was bound by one thing: talent.
Even the talent was expressed in widely divergent ways.
Yet, for almost 100 years, this diverse energy found a place to call home at the Dream Palace.
Sherill Tippins's opus pays homage to the idea that ideas can form powerful and perpetuating communities of believers.
Emerson or Thoreau would have called the Chelsea Hotel home.
Remarkably, Tippins also shows how outside influences and competing interests strengthened the intimate bonds between the Chelsea believers while propelling their creative work beyond its walls.
The Chelsea Hotel was both a cultural and artistic incubator.
Writers, musicians, graphic artists, filmmakers, actors and avant garde adventurists mixed in amongst regular people in the heart of New York City.
Religious-type fervor within a secular, and sometimes sinful environment, somehow produced enduring art.
The Chelsea Hotel was both wicked and wonderful - and so is this book.
6 of 6 people found the following review helpful Thorough and Worth the Read, (Austin, Texas) - See all my reviews This review is from: Inside the Dream Palace: The Life and Times of New York's Legendary Chelsea Hotel (Hardcover) “Inside the Dream Palace: The Life and Times of New York’s Legendary Chelsea Hotel” is a thorough, engrossing history of one of New York City’s most iconic hotels.
Combining a single building’s architectural history with a social history of its inhabitants is no easy feat, and this book manages to do it extremely well.
The characters who inhabited the hotel come to life within its pages, and the building itself remains central to the story.
From nineteenth century society to early twentieth century literary figures, the Beat Generation, to the Warhol “superstars” to the shocking murder of Nancy Spungen and beyond, a great deal of historical context is provided for the hotel’s place in American society – which illustrates its importance all the more.
The book has extensive notes and detailed illustrations which provide eeven more depth.
Sherill Tippins should also be commended for delving deeper into the earlier history of the building and its curious patrons, rather than spotlighting the more recent, lurid history.
Through this book, she shows us that the Chelsea Hotel is a valuable component of New York history.
The Chelsea is a beautiful building with a long, storied past, a strong presence today (even as its doors are closed), and, with the anticipated success of this important historical account, a hopeful future.

I am a New Yorker born and bred.
However it took this amazing author, who moved to Manhattan in the late 1970's (well, OK, she is sort of a New Yorker by now), combined with a force of nature (lightning literally striking and illuminating the amazing Chelsea Hotel as she looked at it), to bring it all on, and bring it to us, the fortunate readers.
The drama, the fascination, the history, the romance, and the sheer love of art as an influence on society is all here.
I chose the book to read for one reason alone.
I was a little off when I think back on why I chose this book.
This is because I was given an amazing gift when I began reading this encyclopedic yet never boring chronical which uses the Chelsea Hotel as its gemlike centerpiece.
And what a setting surrounds it, to enlighten us.
Therefore, no matter what my misguided reason was for deciding to read Inside the Dream Palace, I got so much more that I was expecting.
I received, from this beautifully conceived book, a perfectly amazing overview of New York City in general.
It extends, fluidly encompassing a massive stretch of years.
From the book, I gained an understanding of my home town which begins in the 1800's and continues onward, inexorably and in a stunning manner.
I am so impressed with Inside the Dream Palace, from beginning to end, that I urge other readers to get this book.
If you are at all interested in American history from the period of the robber barons forward, the history of New York in general, the history of the arts, the history of the wealthy versus the poor and the various philosophies which swirl around them, ever changing.
if you are curious about architecture, or famous people ranging from Samuel Clemens all the way to Dylan Thomas to Bob Dylan and beyond.
if you love good stories well told, if you LIKE BOOKS, get this book.
I loved Inside the Dream Palace, the Life and Times of New York's Chelsea Hotel, by Sherrill Tippins.
The author brought every moment to life.
As a writer, she is a bolt of lightning herself.
5 of 5 people found the following review helpful A Look at American History from a Strange, Compelling and Important Vantage Point, (New York, New York) - See all my reviews This review is from: Inside the Dream Palace: The Life and Times of New York's Legendary Chelsea Hotel (Hardcover) Depending on your favorite, or perhaps least favorite, period of modern American artistic expression, the Chelsea Hotel in New York City is either a symbol of potential and creativity or rock-bottom depravity.
The truth, as explained by Sherill Tippins in her latest work of nonfiction, INSIDE THE DREAM PALACE, is that the hotel should be understood as both.
The tricky --- and interesting --- thing is that to understand the ways in which the Chelsea has been a place of destruction, sadness and death is related to the ways it has been, for over 100 years, a place of intellectual and social freedom, and a beacon for the artists and thinkers who have shaped the cultural landscape of America.
The Chelsea Hotel opened its doors in 1884 with the intention of cultivating a relationship with artists and a mingling of various social and economic classes.
This experiment was based loosely on the ideas of French utopian Charles Fourier and was part of a small but influential movement in the US and France of communal and unencumbered living.
Each floor of what was then named the Chelsea Association Building had a mix of apartments, from luxurious multi-roomed suites to more modest two-bedroom arrangements.
The building had state-of-the-art fire protection and original decorative elements based on American motifs.
The top floor was reserved for sun-lit artist studios, and the roof had garden space and a brick promenade.
Right away, some of America's best creative minds, as well as those from Europe, were drawn to the architecture, neighborhood and atmosphere of the Chelsea.
Writer William Dean Howells is one of the first Tippins introduces.
By the 1930s, such important figures as Edgar Lee Masters and Thomas Wolfe were living at the Chelsea, cultivating friendships, living an urban-bohemian lifestyle and working on masterpieces.
Through the decades, the Chelsea, with its free-spirited and passionate community of writers, social activists, dancers, composers and artists, is the inspiration of people like John Sloan and Virgil Thomson, and later Dylan Thomas, Arthur Miller, Gore Vidal and the Beat Poets.
The list goes on and on, and INSIDE THE DREAM PALACE shares stories --- amazing and heartbreaking --- of the lives lived in this landmark building.
Over time, however, the reality of life at the Chelsea grew darker.
Many residents had drug and alcohol problems as they struggled to support themselves financially.
There was increasing violence in the rooms (which, decade by decade, had been divided up into smaller and smaller units), fires broke out on a regular basis, and the once stunning building fell into disrepair.
The owners, staff and management did their best to keep the historic place afloat --- ignoring overdue rent, babysitting residents through breakdowns and drug detoxes, and continuing to promote the Chelsea as a muse for brilliant minds.
By the late 1970s, however, the Chelsea was overrun with drug dealers, prostitutes and thieves, and the devoted long-time residents often felt vulnerable.
With the infamous murder of young punk rocker Nancy Spungen, the Chelsea, once home to Katherine Dunham, O.
Henry, Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe, Bob Dylan and Harry Smith, seemed doomed.
The Chelsea Hotel is currently closed and its future uncertain.
Whatever happens to it, INSIDE THE DREAM PALACE stands as yet another fantastic tribute.
Fascinating and dramatic, this meaty work of nonfiction captures the spirit of the place and puts the residents and passers-through into social, artistic and political context for readers.
Every page readable and totally engrossing, Tippins's book is a look at American history from a strange, compelling and important vantage point and is highly recommended.

, (Chicago) - See all my reviews This review is from: Inside the Dream Palace: The Life and Times of New York's Legendary Chelsea Hotel (Hardcover) A lot of masterly research went into this book.
It’s a crowded account of the art and antics of the people who drifted in and out of the Chelsea Hotel from its inception as a Fourier-style utopian dream of a community in the 1800’s, until 1980 where the author ends her account shortly after the deaths of Nancy Spungen and Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols.
A disproportionally large number of pages are devoted to happenings at the Hotel during the hippie-yippie-punk years of 1965 through the late 1970’s.
Almost all of the last 100 pages of this volume are an account of the drug-drenched, often violent and dissolute atmosphere that pervaded the Hotel throughout that period.
If you are of a more conservative bent, politically or aesthetically, you might feel like an alien wandering through these days of wine and overdoses.
So you might want to skim over or skip the repetitiveness of these “happenings.
” In fact, whatever your taste in art and social philosophy, you might want to take a more overall approach to this entire book.
I at first tried to fully absorb the episodic details of the lives recounted here – from Steven Crane's disappointment with Mark Twain's social apathy - to Brendan Behan’s self-destruction – to Andy Warhol’s celebrity.
But it was all almost too much.
I felt frustrated and overwhelmed.
I felt the author should perhaps have been more selective.
A typical paragraph would include a mind-boggling welter of reference: “Others were also attracted to the delightful spectacle of Kleinsinger performing on his grand piano while his doves cooed and a turtle named Gray danced a step or two.
On any given night, the (Arthur) Millers were likely to find there Eartha Kitt, star of Shinbone Alley (the Broadway adaptation of archy and mehitabel), chattering nonstop about her new film career; Kitt’s mentor, the elegant choreographer and anthropologist Katherine Dunham, recalling her experience working with Virgil Thomson on his 1947 production of The Mother of Us All; or Dunham’s close friend Sophia Delza, an expert on Chinese theatrical dance…” It was heartening to read how many women played leading roles, not only as patrons of the arts, but in creative roles themselves.
But these pages often felt just too dense with incident.
They often seemed more like catalogue than chronicle.
However I came to appreciate the book more when I took a somewhat different approach to it.
Rather than trying to retain individual details of these artists’ flagrancies, I started to read the book more as I would look at a Persian rug – enjoying the overall intricate tapestry of it.
As Tippins takes the reader through the eccentricities of the people occupying these ever more sub-divided rooms, I found I could better appreciate it as a kaleidoscopic shift of multi-colored patterns.
Tippins generally uses a fairly straight-forward reportorial style in her writing.
But she does invoke the telling poetic image occasionally, as for instance when she refers to the inhabitants of the Hotel as a deck of Tarot cards, each a representation of some maverick and mystic archetypal character.
There are a couple of banks of photographs here, giving face to the fractious goings on at the Hotel.
What’s more, Tippins often carries her narrative outside the rooms of the Hotel into society at large, deploring what she concurs with the artists as being the increasingly mercenary tone of the American landscape, a tone that the artists ultimately failed to paint over with their extravagant brilliance.
All-in-all, you might want to check into this Hotel.
The rates are reasonable and the ambience is unique.

" The caliber of "Inside the Dream Palace" is far and away superior to any historic book about popular culture I have read in years.
The background of the Chelsea Hotel in old New York, starting with Clement Moore (author of "The Night Before Christmas"), who donated the land it was built on, is so vastly interesting I could not put the book down once I'd started it.
The author made every scene, idea, event, and person as clear as light--from the political corruption in old New York to the character of Stephen Crane; from poor Paula, trying to design a life in New York, in the beginning of the book, to Harry Smith and his originality, at the end.
Her writing left nothing to doubt since it was obviously so accurately researched (note the extensive references).
Sherill Tippins has managed, through integrity and expertise, to create a book of history, pathos, and accuracy seldom seen.
What a combination of scholarship and popular appeal.
This book will occupy an important place in libraries around the world, as it has succeeded already to apprise the public of information which might easily have been lost.

It is long, with a great bibliography and photos.
After reading, I spent hours on the internet researching more about each aspect of Hotel Chelsea, El Quijote and movies/stories written, and what happened to the key people mentioned.
One of the most memorable books I have read in a very long time.
It brought back lots of memories of the 1960'-70's that I had forgotten.
I would highly recommend just for the period of history it spans.
Now I would like a tour of the landmark hotel.
I would like to see the apartments that were described in the book, the roof top, the stairway with the fancy wrought iron railing.
I would like to experience this for real, see where the dreams were made, as the book is so compelling.
Thank you for bringing out the skeletons of Hotel Chelsea.
Thomas Louie, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Calgary, holds a container of stool pills in triple-coated gel capsules in his lab in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Jeff McIntosh Imagine a low-cost treatment for a life-threatening infection that could cure up to 90 percent of patients with minimal side effects, often in a few days.
It may sound like a miracle drug, but this cutting-edge treatment is profoundly simple -- though somewhat icky: take the stool of healthy patients to cure those with hard-to-treat intestinal infections.
A small but growing number of physicians have begun using these so-called fecal transplants to treat Clostridium difficile, commonly referred to as C-diff, a bacterial infection that causes nausea, cramping and diarrhea.
The germ afflicts a half-million Americans annually and kills about 15,000 of them.
But fecal transplants pose a challenge for the Food and Drug Administration, which has decided to regulate the treatment as an experimental drug.
Stool transplants don't fit neatly into the agency's standard framework.
And while regulators have shown flexibility in their approach, some critics say the mere presence of government oversight is discouraging many doctors from offering transplants.
That's led some patients to seek out questionable "do-it-yourself" websites, forums and videos.
Most researchers agree that the FDA's concerns are warranted.
Patients can contract HIV, hepatitis and other viruses and parasites from fecal matter that is not properly screened.
Additionally, there are no long-term studies on potential side effects of stool transplantation.
FDA officials declined to be interviewed for this story, but said in a written response that the fecal transplantation "shows promise in treating C.
difficile infection that has not been responsive to other therapies.
" Indeed, with many patients no longer responding to potent antibiotics, fecal transplants have emerged as an effective therapy against drug-resistant strains of the C-diff superbug.
The procedure works because the healthy bacteria found in donors' feces can help fight off foreign infections.
"We're dealing with something that is pretty close to miraculous," says Dr.
Lawrence Brandt of New York's Montefiore Medical Center, who has performed over 200 fecal transplants.
Most products reviewed by the FDA spend years in testing before they are submitted to the agency, usually by large drug or medical device developers.
Fecal transplants have followed a different path.
In recent years, a handful of doctors have published small case studies on their use of stool to treat C-diff, with many reporting cure rates of about 90 percent.
In January 2013, the New England Journal of Medicine published the first rigorous, head-to-head study showing that fecal transplants were superior to antibiotics for patients with recurring C-diff.
The FDA announced last May that it would regulate stool transplants as an experimental drug, meaning doctors could only perform transplants under an FDA-approved research application.
The so-called investigational new drug application must include detailed information on the drug to be tested, the study design and safeguards to protect patients.
Assembling a single application can take months or years, even for large drugmakers.
Doctors pushed back, saying the requirement would force them to turn away desperate patients.
"FDA and some others are concerned about the long-term effects," Brandt said.
"But my point was these people are getting ready to die now.
They are not going to survive long enough to develop the diseases you're afraid they're going to get.
" A few weeks later, the FDA revised its position, saying it would not enforce the requirement for doctors treating patients with drug-resistant C-diff -- provided donors are properly screened and patients are informed that fecal transplants are still experimental.
But regulating stool samples as a drug presents other challenges.
While it's easy to limit access to experimental drugs, everyone has access to stool.
And with detailed instructions available on websites like thepowerofpoop.
com, there's nothing to stop patients from trying the procedure at home -- especially if they can't find a doctor to perform it.
"Some of these patients are very desperate and they're not going to take no for an answer," says Dr.
Michael Edmond of Virginia Commonwealth University, who has performed fecal transplants for patients who travel from as far away as Ohio.
Catherine Duff of Carmel, Indiana, says she had no choice but to help herself.
In April 2012, she was suffering through her seventh C-diff.
infection, going to the bathroom 20 to 30 times a day and making multiple trips to the hospital due to dehydration.
"My quality of life had gotten to the point where I was beginning to think that it might be better to die," says Duff, 58.
Duff asked three different physicians if she could try a fecal transplant, but none were willing to perform the procedure.
Her gastroenterologist did offer to test her husband's stool to make sure it wasn't contaminated.
Using instructions found online, Duff and her husband created a solution from his stool sample, mixing it with saline in a blender and administering it via an enema bottle.
Four hours later, Duff said she felt good enough to get up and go for a walk.
Today, Duff runs a nonprofit group, the Fecal Transplant Foundation, which aims to raise awareness of the procedure and help patients.
Duff says she gets up to 15 emails a day from patients looking for a doctor or a donor.
Some even ask if they can use a stool sample from their infants or pets.
Duff says the unresolved status of FDA's oversight discourages more doctors from offering the treatment.
"There are so many doctors who are suspicious that the FDA could change their mind at any given moment and decide to not exercise discretion," Duff says.
According to a list maintained by the foundation, only about 100 physicians offer fecal transplants in the U.
There is no one method for performing the procedure.
Some doctors liquefy the stool and drip it into the patient's colon via colonoscopy.
Others use a tube that runs from the nose down into the stomach.
With so few providers available, proponents of stool transplantation have come up with innovative solutions.
One big hurdle is the high cost of screening a stool sample, which can run up to $1,500 per sample.
Insurance typically doesn't cover testing the stool sample because donors are usually healthy without signs of sickness.
Since October 2013, a Boston-based "stool bank" has managed to bring costs down to about $250 per treatment by screening samples in bulk.
To date, OpenBiome has shipped over 300 stool samples in ready-to-use frozen preparations to 39 hospitals.
But in March, the FDA released an updated proposal for regulating fecal transplants, saying doctors should only use stool from a donor who is "known" to either the patient or their physician.
Some doctors and patients worried the proposal, if finalized, would shutter OpenBiome and a handful of other stool banks, which use anonymous donors and ship to providers hundreds of miles away.
But OpenBiome founder, Mark Smith, says his group continues operating after having several productive discussions with the FDA.
Smith says regulators have encouraged him to set up a formal study in which hospitals that work with OpenBiome will contribute data on the safety and effectiveness of fecal transplants.
"They understand the importance of making treatment available for patients today, while making sure there is adequate oversight of the risks," Smith says.
"We're actually totally on the same page.

The Boston Globe is reporting that the, er, Boston Globe is not being sold to Boston Herald publisher Patrick Purcell or former ad exec Jack Connors, despite a Financial Times story to the contrary.
The Financial Times reported last week that the Times Co.
“began discussions two weeks ago” with Connors to buy the Globe and its stake in the Red Sox.
Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Times Co.
and the Sox reached out to Connors earlier this month to gauge his interest in buying the stake in the team, and potentially the Globe.
Two years ago, Connors teamed up with former General Electric Co.
chief executive Jack Welch to put together an unsuccessful bid to buy the Globe.
The Telegram has been rumored to be included in any sale of the Globe as part of the New England Media Group; insiders say it is one of the only pieces in the local empire not losing money hand over fist.

NEW YORK (WFAN) — Eli Manning’s season is mercifully over.
On Sunday against the Redskins, in the Giants’ final game of 2013, the quarterback walked off the field in the second quarter with a left ankle injury after throwing an interception.
It was a brutal ending to a highly-disappointing campaign for Manning and his Giants, one in which Big Blue finished 7-9 and missed the playoffs for the fourth time in five years.
With the offseason officially underway, and plenty of fans and pundits alike proclaiming that this is the beginning of the end for the two-time Super Bowl champion, Manning is as motivated as ever to prove his worth.
“You want to come back and prove to yourself and your teammates and your organization that you’re committed, and that I can play at the high level that I’ve been playing at in the past,” the two-time Super Bowl MVP told WFAN co-hosts Joe Benigno and Evan Roberts on Monday.
“Obviously this year was tough.
I can think of a number of throws that I wish I had back.
The Giants’ signal caller threw 18 touchdowns to 27 interceptions — leading the league in picks by five — and completing 57.
He was also sacked 39 times and had seven fumbles.
Despite his championship pedigree, the co-captain knows that he needs to make a statement next season and show all the doubters that he still has it.
“I’m gonna work my tail off,” the three-time Pro Bowler told Joe & Evan.
“I’m gonna do everything I can to look at this film and fix the things that I think are wrong and make adjustments to come back and play at the level that I know I can play.
I can win games in this league.
” Wide receiver Victor Cruz said he thought there was a little bit of a disconnect between the quarterback and the receiving corps on 2013.
Manning couldn’t disagree with Cruz’s assessment.
“I thought our work wasn’t as good as it needed to be,” the 32-year-old said.
“We had a number of mistakes between the both of us that were costly.
Some of them led to interceptions and some led to incompletions.
We just weren’t as solid and as sound as we need to be in this league … We weren’t as sharp as we needed to be.
From a whole offensive standpoint, it wasn’t our best work.

Chetrit was born in Morocco in the 1960s to a Moroccan Jewish family, the son of Simon and Alice Chetrit.
[1][2] He has three brothers: Meyer Chetrit, Jacob Chetrit, and Juda Chatrit.
[3] The Chetrit family made their initial fortune in textiles[1] and shipping.
[4] In 1996, his father and his brother David were arrested and jailed in Morocco for smuggling and were cited as an example of injustice by the U.
State Department in their annual human rights report.
They were pardoned and released in 1998.
[4] He arrived in the United States initially tasked with furthering the family's textile business working as an importer/exporter.
After pleading guilty to one felony count of violating customs laws in 1990 (and being sentenced to three years’ probation), he turned to real estate assembling a portfolio of outer-borough residential properties which he sold for $70 million in the early 1990s.
[1] In 1994, he entered into his first commercial real estate transaction, purchasing an office building on West 44th Street for $13 million.
[1] In 2004, Chetrit was the lead investor in a group that purchased the 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago for $840 million with partners Lloyd Goldman, Joseph Moinian, and Jeffrey Feil, eventually changing the name to the Willis Tower in 2009.
[1] Other purchases include Park West Village on the Upper West Side, the International Toy Center on Madison Square Park, 500 and 512 Seventh Ave.
in the Garment District, and the Caledonian Hospital complex in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.
[5] In 2011, after a disagreement, the Chetrit brothers divided the family business into two entities with Joseph and Meyer operating under the Chetrit Group; and Jacob and Juda under the Chetrit Organization.
[3][6] Also in 2011, partnering with David Bistricer, he purchased the Chelsea Hotel for $80 million;[7][8][9] they sold their interest in 2013.
[10] In 2013, in his largest transaction to date, he and his partner David Bistricer, purchased the Sony Tower in New York City for $1.
He intends to convert the building into condominiums.

He will typically select structures with flexible zoning (which broadens the pool of future purchasers) in areas seeing a downturn and thanks to his minimal use of debt, he has the ability to wait the market out.
At times this approach creates conflict with local businesses who want immediate change.

The United States will lead a $750 million effort to fight the worst Ebola outbreak in history, The Washington Post reported Monday.
Up to 3,000 military personnel may be used in the fight against the disease — check out the White House fact sheet on the response.
We’ve compiled a partial list of the best longer stories on the Ebola outbreak so far.
Let us know at Storyline@washpost.
com, and we’ll add to this list.
How the Ebola crisis started — and why it was so difficult to maintain: In Vanity Fair, Jeffrey E.
Stern investigates the origins of the current outbreak and traces it to Guinea near Sierra Leone: “In Meliandou, bushmeat has long been a common source of food.
As elsewhere in West Africa, hunters wade into the forest and come back with whatever they can find.
Once, not so long ago, what they found was a rich and varied bounty: monkeys, antelope, squirrels.
That has changed; the whole eco-system has re-arranged itself.
After civil wars broke out in Liberia and Sierra Leone, refugees poured over the borders, and the population grew, even as a power struggle in Guinea took an economic toll.
People started looking to the rich resource all around them: trees.
Trees were felled to make way for farms or burned down for charcoal.
Endless truckloads of timber were shipped to construction companies.
The forest suffered another trauma as mining interests—the Anglo-Australian Rio Tinto, the omnipresent Chinese—pushed aggressively to exploit the country’s natural resources (bauxite mostly).
As the forests disappeared, so too did the buffer separating humans from animals—and from the pathogens that animals harbor.
O cuts hurt the Ebola response, just before the outbreak happened: Sheri Fink of The New York Times has a great look at how because of cuts, “much of the work of spotting outbreaks was left to desperately poor countries ill prepared for the task”: “The Ebola epidemic has exposed gaping holes in the ability to tackle outbreaks in an increasingly interconnected world, where diseases can quickly spread from remote villages to cities housing millions of people.
, the United Nations agency assigned in its constitution to direct international health efforts, tackle epidemics and help in emergencies, has been badly weakened by budget cuts in recent years, hobbling its ability to respond in parts of the world that need it most.
Its outbreak and emergency response units have been slashed, veterans who led previous fights against Ebola and other diseases have left, and scores of positions have been eliminated — precisely the kind of people and efforts that might have helped blunt the outbreak in West Africa before it ballooned into the worst Ebola epidemic ever recorded.
military aid isn’t quite enough Laurie Garret, a senior fellow for global health at the Council for Foreign Relations, won a Pulitzer for her coverage of the 1995 Ebola outbreak.
In September, she participated in a briefing for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and emphasized the urgency of the situation: “Nothing short of heroic, record-breaking mobilization is necessary at this late stage in the epidemic.
Without it, I am prepared to predict that by Christmas, there could be up to 250,000 people cumulatively infected in West Africa.
At least 30 nations around the world, I dare predict, will have had an isolated case gain entry inside their borders, and some will be struggling as Nigeria now is, tracking down all possibly exposed individuals and hoping to stave off secondary spread.
The great African economic miracle will be reversing, not just in the hard-hit countries but regionally, as the entire continent gets painted with the Ebola fear brush…Lawlessness will rise as Ebola claims the lives of police and law enforcement personnel, and terrified cops quit their jobs.
State stability for hard-hit nations will be questionable, or nonexistent.
” Adam Nossiter of The New York Times examines how the Ebola crisis is unfolding in two distinct fashions: “Inside the Ebola zone, the fear is based on a potent reality.
Ebola kills about half its victims, the epidemic is so far unchecked, and the medical resources on the ground, largely sent in from elsewhere, are not keeping pace.
In fact they are losing ground.
That truth is difficult for people in the West to grasp.
The misapprehension is comprehensible, because one of the world’s deadliest viruses is afflicting the weakest, least-prepared societies in the world.
” “Outside the zone, hysteria over Ebola has led to the collective stigmatization of a big chunk of the African continent.
Anybody coming from West Africa is suspected of carrying the disease.
Inside the zone, life goes on, and people shop in markets — if not quite as normal, then at least as much so as human survival mechanisms will allow.
Near the gates of the Ebola treatment center in Guéckédou, Guinea, for instance, where the epidemic started, a licentious-looking bar called the “Deuxième Bureau” — “Second Office,” a local reference to the house of a kept woman or mistress — was still welcoming customers in mid-July, even as dying Ebola patients were being ferried past.
” How can we push drug companies to develop drugs that won’t be sold en masse.
“Diseases like malaria and tuberculosis, which together kill two million people a year,” Surowiecki writes, “have received less attention from pharmaceutical companies than high cholesterol.
” “The key is to reward companies for creating substantial public-health benefits.
And the simplest way to do this would be to offer prizes for new drugs.
[Kevin Outterson, a co-director of the Health Law program at Boston University ] describes one scenario: ‘The government would make a payment or a stream of payments to the company, and in exchange the company would give up the right to sell the product.
’ The drug company would get paid, and would avoid all the expenses of trying to push a new product (which you don’t want with a last-resort antibiotic, anyway).
Society would get a new drug, and public-health officials would be able to control how it was promoted and used.
What it’s like to hunt for Ebola Todd Frankel has the story of Joseph Fair, a 37-year-old American in Sierra Leone who has dedicated his life to fighting Ebola.
“Fair has worked seven days a week, hunting for ways to curb the outbreak, at times begging international groups for staff and supplies.
He sent his girlfriend home to California months ago.
Too dangerous here, he told her.
He’s seen Sierra Leonean doctors and nurses — friends he’s known for years — get infected and die.
He sweated out his own Ebola scare.
‘It’s like he was trying single-handedly to stop this outbreak,’ says Randal Schoepp, chief of the U.
Army’s applied diagnostics branch at Fort Detrick, Md.
, who has worked with Fair in West Africa.
” More: What it’s like to cover Ebola.
And the simple method used to screen for Ebola at airports.
Why 75 percent of Ebola deaths are of women.
Jina Moore of Buzzfeed has an excellent story about some heartbreaking inequities in the Ebola death toll.
“To families losing their loved ones, Ebola is a heartless killer.
It demands what most people consider a ruthless response to suffering: distance.
Its secret weapon is not the scientific mystery of its seven proteins.
It’s the human need to show compassion and care, and it’s killing Liberia’s women.
The Ministry of Health says fully 75% of the Ebola deaths it has counted are women, but it doesn’t release disaggregated mortality statistics.
But Tolbert Nyenswah, the assistant minister of health who provided the estimate, agrees that whatever the number, women bear the biggest mortality burden of this disease.
Culturally, they are expected to do the caretaking.
‘In this country,” he said, “men are bullshit.
’” More: Meet the men with the most dangerous jobs in Ebola-ridden Liberia.
Last year, during his best three-month stretch, Jordan Golson sold about $750,000 worth of computers and gadgets at the Apple Store in Salem, N.
It was a performance that might have called for a bottle of Champagne — if that were a luxury Mr.
“Part of me was thinking, ‘This is great.
I’m an Apple fan, the store is doing really well.
’ But when you look at the amount of money the company is making and then you look at your paycheck, it’s kind of tough.
” America’s love affair with the smartphone has helped create tens of thousands of jobs at places like Best Buy and Verizon Wireless and will this year pump billions into the economy.
Within this world, the Apple Store is the undisputed king, a retail phenomenon renowned for impeccable design, deft service and spectacular revenues.
Last year, the company’s 327 global stores took in more money per square foot than any other United States retailer — wireless or otherwise — and almost double that of Tiffany, which was No.
2 on the list, according to the research firm RetailSails.
But most of Apple’s employees enjoyed little of that wealth.
While consumers tend to think of Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.
, as the company’s heart and soul, a majority of its workers in the United States are not engineers or executives with hefty salaries and bonuses but rather hourly wage earners selling iPhones and MacBooks.
About 30,000 of the 43,000 Apple employees in this country work in Apple Stores, as members of the service economy, and many of them earn about $25,000 a year.
They work inside the world’s fastest growing industry, for the most valuable company, run by one of the country’s most richly compensated chief executives, Tim Cook.
Last year, he received stock grants, which vest over a 10-year period, that at today’s share price would be worth more than $570 million.
And though Apple is unparalleled as a retailer, when it comes to its lowliest workers, the company is a reflection of the technology industry as a whole.
The Internet and advances in computing have created untold millionaires, but most of the jobs created by technology giants are service sector positions — sales employees and customer service representatives, repairmen and delivery drivers — that offer little of Silicon Valley’s riches or glamour.
Much of the debate about American unemployment has focused on why companies have moved factories overseas, but only 8 percent of the American work force is in manufacturing, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Job growth has for decades been led by service-related work, and any recovery with real legs, labor experts say, will be powered and sustained by this segment of the economy.
And as the service sector has grown, the definition of a career has been reframed for millions of American workers.
“In the service sector, companies provide a little bit of training and hope their employees leave after a few years,” says Arne L.
Kalleberg, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina.
“Especially now, given the number of college kids willing to work for low wages.
” By the standards of retailing, Apple offers above average pay — well above the minimum wage of $7.
25 and better than the Gap, though slightly less than Lululemon, the yoga and athletic apparel chain, where sales staff earn about $12 an hour.
The company also offers very good benefits for a retailer, including health care, 401(k) contributions and the chance to buy company stock, as well as Apple products, at a discount.
But Apple is not selling polo shirts or yoga pants.
Divide revenue by total number of employees and you find that last year, each Apple store employee — that includes non-sales staff like technicians and people stocking shelves — brought in $473,000.
“These are sales rates for a consulting company,” said Horace Dediu, an analyst who blogged about the calculation on the site Asymco.
Electronics and appliance stores typically post $206,000 in revenue per employee, according to the latest figures from the National Retail Federation.
Even Apple, it seems, has recently decided it needs to pay its workers more.
Last week, four months after The New York Times first began inquiring about the wages of its store employees, the company started to inform some staff members that they would receive substantial raises.
An Apple spokesman confirmed the raises but would not discuss their size, timing or impetus, nor who would earn them.
I am Robert LoScalzo, a resident of Queens.
I'm opposed to unnecessarily sacrificing even more parkland to the USTA.
I am very concerned that you may not be aware, that USTA is perfectly capable of renovating its facilities while keeping within its present footprint, and NOT expanding onto even more parkland.
USTA's EIS for this project (chapter 17) sets forth two options – the "Alternative Without Additional Park Land" and the "Alternative Without New Park Land Alienation" – either of which would rebuild the USTA stadiums, in place.
So if you're in favor of creating construction and trade jobs, those two reasonable options would absolutely do so, and would also satisfy USTA's desire for new, state-of-the-art facilities – without further encroaching into Flushing Meadows Corona Park.
USTA's self-serving conclusion is that rebuilding within its current footprint is not acceptable to USTA.
USTA wants more parkland, for two main reasons: Number One: To increase the width of a walkway inside the tennis center, to provide a more luxurious experience for tennis people during just two weeks of the U.
If that walkway really isn't wide enough, U.
Open fans would have testified at the public hearings in support of widening it.
Solving a non-existent problem two weeks out of the year does not justify sacrificing sacred parkland.
Number Two: USTA wants to increase attendance at the U.
Open by 10,000 more people every day.
But who says that we want 10,000 more people there, or that it's even reasonable to put them there.
The impacts of those people are very significant.
A very large number of them will travel by car, taxi or limousine.
Here are two photographs showing the effects on Roosevelt Avenue during the 2012 U.
Two entire lanes are coned off – one in each direction – to accommodate drop-off and pick-up of tennis people.
This situation is already very bad – but USTA wants to attract another 10,000 people here per day.
By the way, these conditions on Roosevelt are right next to the proposed site of the Mets mall in the Citi Field parking lot – which would be the largest mall in New York City.
How can you reconcile commandeering Roosevelt Avenue like this, with the simultaneous traffic to be generated by a huge mall, right here.
Open is already well established.
It does not depend on whether 10,000 more people attend it.
This USTA proposal, like the two others that impinge on our park, are efforts to close deals on parkland while the Bloomberg administration is still around to sign the papers.
Please do right by the people of Queens: Tell USTA to renovate within its existing space, and reject its self-serving application to expand its size and its impacts.
Robert LoScalzo Whitestone, New York 718-352-4534 Proposed E X P A N S I O N of United States Tennis Association National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows Corona Park IMPACTS UPON TREES Excerpts from the USTA Draft Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 1, page 8: "Approximately 422 trees would be removed, which would be transplanted to the extent practicable" (emphasis added).
Chapter 7, page 2: "Six state-listed endangered willow oak trees located in the walkway between Louis Armstrong Stadium and the Indoor Tennis Center would be displaced as a result of the proposed project.
However, if deemed feasible, these trees may be relocated to another area of the NTC or onto adjacent DPR property" (emphasis added).
Chapter 7, page 1: "The analysis finds that the proposed project would not result in any significant adverse natural resources impacts" – despite the likely tree impacts.
____________________________ USTA CAN RENOVATE WITHOUT ENCROACHING ONTO MORE PARKLAND USTA is perfectly capable of renovating its facilities within its existing footprint, and rebuilding its stadiums in place, WITHOUT expanding onto any additional parkland.
In fact, USTA’s Draft Environmental Impact Statement (chapter 17) analyzes two scenarios in which renovations are accomplished without additional parkland: "Alternative Without Additional Park Land" • 0.
94 acres of park land would NOT be added to the NTC site.
• USTA stadiums would be rebuilt, in place – providing the same construction and trade jobs as if built elsewhere.
• The "opportunity to improve pedestrian circulation" only for patrons of the U.
Open attendee has testified that the existing pedestrian circulation is insufficient.
) • There would be no increase in capacity of the NTC to allow 10,000 more visitors per day to attend the U.
Open – but there would also be no adverse traffic impacts arising from the influx of those additional 10,000 visitors.
"Alternative Without New Park Land Alienation" • NO new alienation of park land.
26 acres of previously alienated park land would be added to the NTC site.
• This alternative "would result in the same development program as the Alternative Without Additional Park Land", above.
Either of the above two reasonable alternatives would result in renovated USTA facilities, but without further compromising Flushing Meadows Corona Park.
The pending USTA ULURP application should be denied, and the USTA told to pursue either of the above two reasonable alternatives.

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Officials in Queens have called on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to do more to help Long Island City businesses in the face of planned weekend shutdowns on the 7 line this year.
The MTA announced last month that it will shut down the line between Queensboro Plaza and Times Square for 13 weekends between the end of this month and July.
The authority said the shutdowns are necessary for maintenance and signal work.
Queens officials argue that halting the line for such an extended period of time will isolate residents in the neighborhood.
“‘It not only poses a problem for folks who live in Long Island City, but other folks from other neighborhoods, including parts of Manhattan, find it incredible difficult to get to Long Island City,” New York City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer told 1010 WINS.
Van Bramer said the shutdown could also devastate small businesses in Long Island City.
“One big weekend could make the difference between survival or going out of business.
And in this case, the MTA is shutting down the 7 train for almost half of the weekends in the entire calendar year, which is an incredible hardship on our small business owners who are trying to make ends meet.
” The city councilman and other Queens officials met with MTA officials on Thursday to discuss ways in which the authority could help local businesses while the 7 line is down.
Van Bramer said he wants the MTA to subsidize East River ferry service to Manhattan and allow customers to use MetroCards while train service is down.
He said ferry service would be just a few minutes door-to-door from Long Island City to Midtown and that it would only cost $4 a ride.
Officials also want the MTA to provide express bus service to and from Manhattan, a request that has been made before, as well as a campaign promoting Long Island City businesses while the line is halted.
“They can use their resources to have a robust, and meaningful marketing, and advertising campaign letting folks know that Long Island City is open for business when these weekend closures are taking place so that folks don’t feel like Long Island City is closed,” Van Bramer told 1010 WINS.
Additional closures are expected in the second half of 2014 as well.

Medicare spending isn’t just lower than experts predicted a few years ago.
On a per-person basis, Medicare spending is actually falling.
Spending per Medicare patient has almost always grown more rapidly than the economy as a whole, often by a wide margin.
Lately, though, some have taken to using the unwieldy phrase “negative excess cost growth.
” This year, Medicare, which covers those 65 and older and people with disabilities, will spend about $11,200 on average for every person enrolled in the program.
By comparison, it spent $12,000 three years ago, in inflation-adjusted dollars.
The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that the number will fall below $11,000 by 2017 and stay below this year’s number until 2020.
The starkness of the pattern has been obscured because the budget office does not generally adjust its numbers for inflation.
So its official charts — and other charts based on them — can mislead when it comes to future costs because they show increases that are simply a reflection of economy-wide inflation.
Adjusted to reflect the value of a dollar, Medicare spending has not been rising and is not projected to rise in the next few years.
The only other time cost growth has ever stayed below zero was in the late 1990s, when Congress made substantial cuts to Medicare spending.
Then, the trend lasted for three years.
This time, the budget office expects it to be more enduring.
The recent pattern reflects two main factors.
One is that the baby boom generation is entering the program.
In the long term, that’s a problem for Medicare’s finances because the number of people it must care for is going to surge.
But in the short term, it skews the group enrolled in Medicare toward a younger, healthier population.
The second factor is more surprising and consequential.
Over the last few years, Medicare patients have been using fewer expensive medical services, particularly hospital care and prescription drugs.
The budget office is increasingly persuaded that such a pattern is going to last for a while.
The reduction in the usual growth in health care spending means spending for the entire Medicare program is on track to grow more slowly over the next decade, even as more baby boomers reach retirement age and the number of people entering the program grows.
An inflation-adjusted picture of Medicare’s overall spending trajectory, according to the C.
, shows modest growth for the program, especially compared with its estimates from just a few years ago.
Reductions made in the last four years alone are responsible for 10-year savings of more than $715 billion, which dwarfs nearly every deficit-reduction measure currently under discussion.
The 1990s slowdown obviously did not last.
But even if you focus only on what has happened, rather than on what budget analysts think will happen in the future, the change is remarkable.
The notion that Medicare would have been spending less money, per person, would have been hard to fathom just a few years ago.
(Remember the fights about the Affordable Care Act’s “rationing” board and Paul Ryan’s Medicare voucher plan.
Both were aiming for annual excess cost growth targets of 1 percent.
) The demographic pressures on the program still matter, but the flat per-person spending growth makes the Medicare budget more affordable.
Historically, the budget office has thought about excess spending growth as representing about half of Medicare’s future spending growth, with the aging of the population representing the other half.
Now that first half has gotten a lot smaller.

Maybe it's just my opinion, but this is a dumb and bad tweet about baseball players and when they're allowed to party: With a win in Atlanta, the Pirates clinched at least a wild card berth and their second consecutive postseason appearance, after more than two decades without a one.
There are people out there—few of them, but they exist—who believe that a team should not celebrate a mere playoff berth, that the champagne and cigars should be reserved for World Series alone.
That is objectively a terrible take because making the playoffs is probably the greater achievement.
The conventional wisdom these days, backed up by studies, is that the MLB postseason is a crapshoot, and the slog of the regular season is a much better indicator of the best teams.
Just getting to October is the real accomplishment.
But more than that, clubhouse celebrations are awesome.
What the hell else do you play competitive sports if not to celebrate like madmen when you do something great.
And for whatever reason (maybe because they've been here before and now know how to do it up.
), the Pirates' celebration last night was a classic.
Clint Hurdle kicked it off with what was supposed to be a speech but skipped right to the soaking instead: And here are some more photos of the Bucs' champagnekkake.
Sports are bad and sad these days.
The Pirates celebrating should make you happy.
On the Northeastern shores of Lake Ontario, the historic 1830's Morton Brewery site has been reconceived into a world-class Performing Arts Centre at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario.
The only facility of its kind in the region, the 80,000 square-foot Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts unites a diverse range of performance and creative art disciplines under a single roof, housing a 566-seat Performance Hall, classrooms, rehearsal and performance spaces for the School of Music and the Departments of Drama, Film and Media at Queen’s University.
Throughout the design process, Snøhetta worked closely with Queen’s University to develop a collaborative, supportive learning environment for young artists and performers to grow in their discipline.
The breath-taking views and natural calm inspired the design language and material choices for the project, conceiving an open, crisp and clear space for students to focus on Arts Education.
The architectural strategy in re-using the site’s historic buildings was developed through workshops with preservation consultants and the Heritage Committee of Kingston, defining a clear distinction between new structures and architectural heritage elements.
The stainless steel façade of the new structures reflects back upon the monochromatic whites and greys of the winter skies and frozen lake, referencing the moment when water turns to ice.
The complementary dark grey wood siding on the historic structures references black barns, whose dark wood was used to withstand moisture.
A shared green space ties The Isabel with the neighbouring Tett Centre, providing an open, framed view of Lake Ontario for visitors arriving to the Arts Campus.
The centerpiece of the new Performing Arts Centre is the 566-seat performance hall.
Designed as a classical music theatre, the proportions and acoustics are based on studies of the great historic ‘jewel box’ concert halls of Europe.
Working closely with the Acousticians at Arup, the concert hall design allows for superb live acoustical musical performances, without relying on electronic amplification for optimum sound quality.
The hall provides an engaging and intimate experience for both performers and audiences.
Historically, classical music theatres were designed as relatively symmetrical spaces based on the architectural and stylistic preferences during the Baroque and Renaissance periods, but through continual feedback and acoustic modeling studies at Arup’s Soundlab, the design team was able to develop optimized wall shaping and recognized that employing an asymmetrical ceiling layout in a symmetrical room also could provide a superb acoustical experience.
The Concert Hall’s interior design references geological patterns of the Kingston area’s local rock strata, referencing its famed role as limestone capital of Canada.
Employing 3D computer modeling algorithms, Snøhetta and Arup shaped a visually stunning interior that provides the optimum level of sound diffusion, surface texture and specular reflection.
During amplified musical performances, such as Jazz or Rock Music, a series of acoustical drapes can be deployed over sections of the side walls to provide sound absorption and lower the reverberation time.
When entering The Isabel, students and guests are greeted by a large public lobby with stunning waterfront views.
This social meeting place is conceived as a seamless continuation of the spectacular landscape.
Portions of the ceiling plane are finished with the same reflective metal as the facade, bringing reflections of the lake and landscape into the building.
At night, the activities and light of the lobby spill out onto the waterfront, creating a bright, safe environment for visitors to step outside.
The new patio allows patrons to sit close to the lake, while also maintaining a natural edge between land and water.
The design team reclaimed and recycled large quantities of wood flooring, structural columns and beams discovered in the historic buildings to use as wall and ceiling cladding in the public interior spaces, as well as millwork in the greenroom and lobby.
Inside, the rich colour palette provides a cosy, inviting environment for students at work.

The hip-hop music video, posted to YouTube last summer, is a paean to recreational prescription drug use on Staten Island.
Set partly in Duane Reade drug stores, the video, to “My World is Blue” by the White Trash Clan, presents a fantasy world tinted blue, apparently for the color of the pills, and features a young woman playing a blue fairy and blowing kisses to the camera.
“Crush and sniff it,” one man raps.
“Blue is my world in this life how I live it, come out to Staten Island, pay a little visit.
” This week, the life of the woman playing the fairy took a turn, the police said, when she was arrested and charged with three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance.
The police said that the woman, Sharissa Turk, 22, who works by day selling whimsically designed fruit and dessert baskets at an Edible Arrangements on Victory Boulevard, had sold Oxycodone to an undercover officer Read more….
Ilana Panich-Linsman still recalls being an awkward 15-year-old in western Massachusetts, leading a fairly innocent life with a few brainy friends.
Which may explain why one winter night eight years later, she stopped outside a Brooklyn pizza parlor and stared at three 15-year-old girls talking animatedly inside.
They seemed much more self-confident than she had ever been at that age.
Panich-Linsman, who was studying at the International Center of Photography, wanted to shadow and photograph teenage girls as they made the small decisions that began to define them as women.
So she went inside and started to explain how she wanted to be a fly on the wall as they lived their hormone-charged teenage lives.
They were, to her surprise, immediately interested.
“For them, it seemed like it was the most normal thing in the world to be documented and photographed,” she said.
“It probably comes with growing up with reality TV.
They knew exactly what I was saying.
For them it was like, ‘Well, of course.
’ ” She met their parents and asked for permission to follow their children.
After long conversations they agreed.
Panich-Linsman, 25, zeroed in on the three girls, Hannah, Libby and Katie, who all lived in the neighborhood, went to public school and had attentive parents.
Panich-Linsman describes them as very social and much more mature then she was at that age.
“I wouldn’t have had the self-confidence to hang out with them at 15,” she said.
“They were so adultlike — I was way closer to 14 than 16 at that age, and they were much more like 15 going on 18.
” Of course, being 15, they thought of her as closer in age to their middle-aged aunts than to them.
The girls did well in school, but sometimes behaved like — well, teenagers.
They were exploring and experimenting and on occasion hanging out with teenagers who were perhaps less in control.
“These girls were pushing boundaries, but they weren’t pushing so many boundaries that I ever felt like they were in danger, and if they had been in danger there would have been no hesitation to let them know, ‘You know, this isn’t going to end well,’ ” Ms.
Though she saw the role of a documentary photographer to only observe, she said, “when you’re the only adult in a sea of 15-year-olds, you have a secondary role sometimes.
Panich-Linsman followed the girls intensively for nine months and then revisited them for their senior prom in 2012.
She has kept in touch as they went off to college.
“All three are very intelligent, smart women, but they’re still figuring it out,” she said.
“They’re thinking of themselves as individuals, they’re thinking of careers and they’re more mature, yet they still resemble who they were when they were 15.

“The Woman Who Lost Her Soul,” an epic about America’s unbridled military ambitions, has won this year’s Dayton Literary Peace Prize for fiction.
In their announcement of the $10,000 award this morning, the judges said that novelist Bob Shacochis “creates an intricate portrait of the catastrophic events that have led to an endless cycle of vengeance and war between cultures.
” This complex, demanding novel about a father-daughter pair of spies was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and received lavish critical praise when it was published last September.
Moving back and forth over five decades, the story provides an extraordinary vision of 20th-century atrocities and explores the foundations of our ongoing war on terror.
Shacochis, who grew up in the Washington area and now teaches writing at Florida State University, says, “The Dayton award is a young prize, but given its birth in a bona fide peace process and its vision, as well of the distinguished pedigree of its past recipients, perhaps in 10 years or 20 or 50 its status will enter that rarified zone reserved for the Nobel, sans the dynamite.
” Unfortunately, despite the remarkable quality and dramatic relevance of “The Woman Who Lost Her Soul,” it has generated far more enthusiasm among critics than among readers.
But for Elisabeth Schmitz, Shacochis’s editor at Grove/Atlantic, today’s announcement confirms what she’s always thought about the book.
“Nobody tells it straight the way Bob does,” she says.
“Twenty years in the writing and set on three continents over a turbulent century, this book does nothing less than to show us why America stands where it does in the world today.
” Shacochis attributes his life’s work to the values imbued in him as an adolescent in the Washington area: “In ‘The Woman Who Lost Her Soul,’ I was writing about what I know, what I have known since growing up in the ’50s in McLean.
The people running the most powerful nation on earth were our parents and our neighbors and the families sitting next to us in the pews at church (for me, St.
Luke’s in Langley, where after Mass on the first Sunday in June, 1968, my 16-year-old self went up to Bobby Kennedy to shake his hand and say, ‘Good luck in California, Senator’).
” He asks rhetorically, “How could I grow up where I did, and when I did, and not become a writer obsessed by the dynamics of politics and power and, ultimately, peace, after being an eyewitness to such a continuous waste of the nation’s treasure and blood, and our soul as a nation outcast into a wilderness of fear.
My adolescence was an adolescence of assassinations.
” A graduate of the Iowa Writers’ Workshop and a Peace Corps volunteer, Shacochis worked for years as a journalist, covering, among other troubles, the U.
(He can still recall — with a certain degree of pique — the day his mother called him in tears because his 1999 nonfiction book, “The Immaculate Invasion,” was panned on the front of Book World.
“I wish my mother were alive to witness how The Washington Post has come back around to a much more felicitous view of my work — and me.
”) “There are good reasons,” he says, “why we find ourselves mired in the wars of today, this battle between West and East, and my novel tries to dramatize those reasons, and root them in the lives of characters that have surrounded me all my life: the Cold War warriors, the soldiers and sailors, the spooks that sat next to us in high school at the pizza parlor in McLean.
” Grove/Atlantic publisher Morgan Entrekin said he hopes today’s prize for “The Woman Who Lost Her Soul” “will bring it even more attention — and readers.
As a number of reviewers noted, it is the sort of novel of politics and ideas with a broad canvas that is rare these days.
” Also announced Wednesday morning, the Dayton Literary Peace Prize for Nonfiction has been awarded to “Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here,” by University of California at Davis law professor and human rights activist Karima Bennoune.
In her review in The Washington Post last year, Rachel Newcomb wrote, “Bennoune offers a compelling, meticulously researched account of the legions of Muslims whose struggles against fundamentalist violence are almost never reported in our media….
‘Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here’ should be required reading, not only for those of us who are professionally involved with Muslim-majority societies, but also for anyone who mistakenly believes that Muslims are doing nothing to end fundamentalist violence.
” The Dayton judges also named two runner-ups: Jo Roberts’s “Contested Land, Contested Memory: Israel’s Jews and Arabs and the Ghosts of Catastrophe” and Margaret Wrinkle’s debut novel, “Wash.
” The Dayton Literary Peace Prizes — inspired by the 1995 accords that ended the war in Bosnia — “celebrate the power of literature to promote peace, social justice and global understanding.
9 in Dayton, Ohio, Shacochis and Bennoune will each receive $10,000; Roberts and Wrinkle will each receive $1,000.
As previously announced, novelist Louise Erdrich has been named this year’s winner of the Richard C.
Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award, named in honor of the late diplomat who brokered the Dayton Peace Accords.
(Erdrich’s “The Round House” was a finalist for last year’s Dayton prize for fiction.
) To be eligible, books must be published or translated into English and “address the theme of peace on a variety of levels, such as between individuals, among families and communities, or between nations, religions, or ethnic groups.

Sadie Rosenkrantz is like many other Queens residents: she loves to read.
She visits her community library in Forest Hills regularly, at least once a week.
Today, Sadie celebrated her 104th birthday at the library.
Staff honored her with a bouquet, and dedicated two new books to her by a favorite author, James Patterson.
Sadie has been visiting Queens Library at Forest Hills for the past 60 years.
She enjoys attending the musical programs, and especially concerts from Lincoln Center Local.
She checks out the library's calendar to find events of interest on Saturday afternoons, after her regular hair dresser's appointment.
Sadie has a close relationship with all the library's staff, and especially with Bibi Khan, who is the Customer Service Representative.
They frequently speak on the phone.
Sadie says the service at the library is "absolutely fantastic.
" She is concerned for the future: what if her favorite library people retire.
Christian Zabriskie writes: “Libraries in Miami are in the final stages of an incredible budget fight.
It’s been a pitched battle between library advocates and a mayor who has repeatedly slashed library funding, tried to eliminate library jobs, and worked to eliminate library branches and limit services.
In many ways it is a microcosm of the larger fight for libraries across the Unites States.
It will hopefully be seen as a turning point when our citizens demand more from their elected leaders and the social fabric can be rewoven.

Storme DeLarverie fought the police in 1969.
This year, she was in a nursing home, remembering what she could.
More Photos » At noon on Sunday, thousands of marchers filled Fifth Avenue for New York City’s annual gay pride parade.
Nearly six miles away, on the sixth floor of a nursing home in Brooklyn, the frail, white-haired woman in beige pajamas and brown slippers in Room 609 sat motionless at the edge of her bed, staring out her window.
She touched the medallion on her necklace — an image of St.
Jude, the patron saint of lost causes — and fiddled with one of her rings.
“This one,” she said of the ring on a pinky finger, “I hit a guy so hard I knocked the stone out, and I hadn’t gotten around to put it back yet.
” She had forgotten that the gay pride march was Sunday.
Her mind and her memory are not as sharp as her wit and her tongue.
She said she had been living there, at the Oxford Nursing Home, for years (she arrived in April).
She was not sure how old she was (she will be 90 in December).
The woman in Room 609, Storme DeLarverie, has dementia.
She is but one anonymous elderly New Yorker in a city with thousands upon thousands of them.
And many of those who marched down Fifth Avenue on Sunday would be hard pressed to realize that this little old lady — once the cross-dressing M.
of a group of drag-queen performers, once a fiercely protective (and pistol-packing) bouncer in the city’s lesbian bars — was one of the reasons they were marching.
DeLarverie fought the police in 1969 at the historic riot at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village that kicked off the gay rights movement.
The first gay pride parade in 1970 was not a parade at all but a protest marking the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall uprising.
DeLarverie may have been the cross-dressing lesbian whose clubbing by the police was the catalyst for the riots (the woman has never been identified).
While others are adamant that Ms.
DeLarverie was not that woman, no one disputes that she was there, and no one doubts that the woman who had been fighting back all her life fought back in the summer of 1969.
At one point on Sunday, she said she was not struck by the police.
At another moment, she said a police officer had hit her from behind.
“He wound up flat on his back on the ground,” said Ms.
DeLarverie, a member of the Stonewall Veterans’ Association.
“I don’t know what he hit me with.
He hit me from behind, the coward.
DeLarverie has struggled in recent years with a confluence of housing, mental health and legal issues.
In 2009, a social services group, the Jewish Association for Services for the Aged, was appointed her legal guardian by a judge.
In March, she was hospitalized after she was found disoriented and dehydrated at the Chelsea Hotel, her home for decades.
No one occupies her room on the seventh floor of the hotel, but it remains unclear if she will ever return.
A small group of friends, including some of her neighbors at the Chelsea Hotel, visit her regularly.
A social worker with the nonprofit group SAGE, which provides services to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender older people, has been assisting Ms.
DeLarverie since 1999, when she was at risk of eviction from the hotel.
Some of her friends said they had been frustrated by the way she was treated by the authorities and others, and they expressed disappointment that Ms.
DeLarverie’s troubles have not been a widespread concern for many gay and lesbian activists.
“I feel like the gay community could have really rallied, but they didn’t,” said Lisa Cannistraci, a longtime friend of Ms.
DeLarverie’s who is the owner of the lesbian bar Henrietta Hudson, where Ms.
DeLarverie worked as a bouncer.
“The young gays and lesbians today have never heard of her,” Ms.
Cannistraci said, “and most of our activists are young.
They’re in their 20s and early 30s.
The community that’s familiar with her is dwindling.
DeLarverie’s friends said they were disturbed because she spent most of her days inside the nursing home and they had not been allowed to take her outside, even for walks.
Leah Ferster, chief services officer for the Jewish Association for Services for the Aged, said she was not aware that that was a concern among her friends.
“We have to make sure she’s medically capable and able, and if that was true, then we would be glad to speak with her friends and see if we can come up with a safe plan and have her go out for a few hours,” she said.
DeLarverie’s first name is pronounced STORM-ee, like the weather, but in Room 609 on Sunday, she was calm, chatty, graceful.
Her life has been flamboyant, boundary-breaking, the stuff of pulp fiction.
Friends say she worked for the mob in Chicago.
The drag-queen group she performed with decades ago, known as the Jewel Box Revue, regularly played the Apollo in Harlem (she dressed as a man and the men dressed as women).
She was photographed by Diane Arbus.
She carried a straight-edge razor in her sock, and while some merely walked to and from the gay and lesbian bars in the Village, friends said, she patrolled.
Sitting at the edge of her bed, her mind turned again to the parade, where, in the past, she had been a fixture.
She said she had a message for those who took part in the celebration.
“Just be themselves, like they’ve always been,” she said.
“They don’t have to pretend anything.
DeLarverie asked what time it was, and what time the march started.
At one point, she took off her slippers and seemed to look for her shoes.
“I think they started already,” she said.
“They’re probably wondering where I am.
From Crains: One small technological step for government may be a giant leap for aggrieved New Yorkers: Now you can upload evidence online when fighting parking tickets and other violations.
For several years, residents and small businesses have been able to dispute tickets online but unable to upload evidence to support their arguments.
That meant that only incorrectly written tickets could be dismissed.
Now, those accused of violations can prove their case in court without having to leave their home or office.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg and City Council Speaker Christine Quinn announced the new service at a press conference Monday.
“It's less work for us and less work for the citizens of this city,” Mr.
” No more having to dash out to a city finance center during your lunch break to convince a judge that your car wasn't parked in a bus stop or driving through a red light.
No longer will businesses have to close shop for an afternoon to argue that the dirty sidewalk is someone else's responsibility.
Online hearings will allow New Yorkers to submit supporting materials, such as photos or other documents, with their written defense.
Each case is reviewed by an administrative law judge, who will rule on parking tickets by email within 10 days and within a month for tickets that come under the purview of the Environmental Control Board.
KABUL, Afghanistan — For the first time since Vietnam, a United States Army general was killed in an overseas conflict on Tuesday when an Afghan soldier opened fire on senior American officers at a military training academy.
Greene, was the highest-ranking member of the NATO-led coalition killed in the Afghanistan war, and his death punctuated the problems vexing the Americans as they try to wind down the 13-year-old conflict, contending with a political crisis that has threatened to splinter the Afghan government and leave it unable to fend off the Taliban.
The general was among a group of senior American and Afghan officers making a routine visit to Afghanistan’s premier military academy on the outskirts of Kabul when an Afghan soldier sprayed the officers with bullets from the window of a nearby building, hitting at least 15 before he was killed.
Though American officials said General Greene was not believed to have been specifically targeted, his violent death at the hands of an Afghan soldier, not an insurgent, was a reminder of the dangers faced by even the highest-ranking, and best protected, officers in Afghanistan.
Driving home the threat, an Afghan police officer opened fire on American soldiers visiting the governor of Paktia Province in eastern Afghanistan soon after the shooting at the military academy, Afghan and coalition officials said.
The policeman was fatally shot; none of the Americans were wounded.
There was no indication that either of the attackers were members of the Taliban, or that their acts were coordinated.
The insurgents did not claim the attackers as their own, instead hailing them as hero soldiers.
American officials said they had no reason to suspect the gunman at the military academy was anything but an ordinary Afghan soldier whose motivations remained a mystery.
But scores of these so-called insider attacks have plagued the American military in recent years, and Afghan and American commanders believe the vast majority have been carried out by Afghan soldiers and police alienated and angered by the protracted war in their country, and the corrupt and ineffectual government that the United States has left in place.
Few of the attacks are believed to have been results of coordinated Taliban plots.
Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said officials believed the gunman was “a member of the Afghan national security forces,” but he had no other details about him or the circumstances of the shooting.
Still, Admiral Kirby maintained on Tuesday that the insider attack, the first in months, would not change the Obama administration’s plans to leave a residual force in Afghanistan after most American forces are withdrawn at the end of the year and the NATO combat mission here formally concludes.
Admiral Kirby emphasized the progress that Afghan forces had made in recent years, citing as examples their role in limiting violence in the presidential election in April and the June runoff vote.
“They have had a good year, securing not one, but two, national elections and stopping or minimizing the impact of countless numbers of attacks throughout the country — even in Kabul,” he said.
Yet the shooting was a blunt reminder that discipline and vetting remain a challenge, and rogue Afghan soldiers and policemen remain a threat, despite a sharp drop in insider attacks since 2012, when the violence peaked and dozens of coalition service members were killed by Afghan counterparts.
With foreign troops having largely ceded their front-line role to Afghan forces in the past two years, training and advising Afghans is one of the few crucial roles still played here by the coalition.
American soldiers largely stay out of the Taliban’s line of fire, but they must still maintain close contact with Afghan soldiers and policemen.
Foreign forces have few options for protecting themselves, short of cutting off contact with the Afghans.
But that would make the training mission impossible, as General Greene, 55, most likely knew.
He was one of the most senior officers overseeing the transition from a war led and fought by foreign troops to one conducted by Afghan forces.
His specialty was logistics — he was a longtime acquisitions officer — and he had been dispatched to Afghanistan to help the Afghan military address one of its most potentially debilitating weaknesses: an inability to manage soldiers and weaponry.
Compared with the infantry grunts who did tours of duty in the Taliban-infested hinterlands of Afghanistan, General Greene had an assignment that appeared to carry far less risk.
Yet on Tuesday, he became one of the more than 2,300 American service members killed in Afghanistan.
Admiral Kirby said his death reflected an inherent risk of the war, calling insider attacks “a pernicious threat and always difficult to ascertain.
” “Afghanistan is still a war zone,” he said.
The political crisis that has gripped Afghanistan in recent months has increased the doubts among many here about the American project to rebuild the country.
The crisis grew out of a presidential election runoff in June marred by widespread fraud.
President Obama had to personally intervene last month when it appeared that powerful supporters of Abdullah Abdullah, one of the two candidates, were poised to seize power in what would have amounted to a coup.
Secretary of State John Kerry was dispatched to Kabul, and he brokered a deal between Mr.
Abdullah and the rival candidate, Ashraf Ghani, to audit all 8.
1 million votes cast in the runoff and to form a unity government after a winner was declared.
But the audit quickly became mired in squabbles between the rival campaigns, and there has been almost no progress in negotiating details of the unity government.
Still, the audit finally appeared to be making progress this week, providing a respite from troubling developments for American and Afghan officials — until Tuesday’s shooting.
The attack occurred around noon and sent shock waves through the coalition command and Afghanistan’s defense establishment, bringing nearly all other work to a halt.
In the immediate aftermath, Gen.
, the commander of coalition forces, ordered all foreign advisers and trainers out of Afghan government ministries and back to their bases.
At the military academy, foreign troops appeared on edge, fearful of another attack.
Massoud Hossaini, a photographer for The Associated Press, said he had arrived at the camp’s gate ahead of other journalists, and just as coalition armored vehicles were departing.
A coalition soldier manning a roof-mounted gun on one vehicle shouted for Mr.
Hossaini to “get away,” then fired what was apparently a warning shot.
“I don’t know what he fired; it was fired near our car,” Mr.
Hossaini said, adding that he quickly left the scene.
, the gunner appeared to be firing a warning flare.
“I haven’t seen anything like this since 2010,” when an American and a Canadian colonel and two American lieutenant colonels were killed in a suicide car bombing, said an American official in Kabul.
There was “more than a little shock and numbness” at coalition headquarters.
Another coalition official compared General Greene’s death to the killings of American advisers at Afghanistan’s Interior Ministry by an Afghan government employee in 2012, an attack that led many Western officials here to question the viability of their purpose.
That attack came amid a wave of anti-American violence over burnings of Qurans at Bagram Air Field, a sprawling base north of Kabul.
There was no similar incident before Tuesday’s shooting.
The general and the other Afghan and American officers were standing by a water purification tank when the Afghan soldier opened fire without warning, a senior Pentagon official said.
Afghan forces responded quickly, gunning down the assailant, and the shooting was over nearly as quickly as it began, Afghan and coalition officials said.
A German brigadier general and a senior Afghan commander were among the wounded, Afghan and coalition officials said, though they declined to identify any of the Western victims by name.
The identity of the gunman was not disclosed either.
Late into the night on Tuesday, many details of the shooting were unclear, and the coalition, in an official statement, would only confirm that one of its service members had been killed in what it described as “an incident” at the Marshal Fahim National Defense University in Kabul.
Until Tuesday, no officer in the American military of major general rank or higher had been reported killed by hostile action abroad since the Vietnam War.
According to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial database, Maj.
was killed on May 12, 1970, when his helicopter was shot down.
Rembrandt Cecil Robinson, who was the Navy’s equivalent of a major general, was killed on May 8, 1972, when his helicopter crashed.
Five other American officers of comparable rank were killed in the war, all in air crashes, whether accidental or caused by hostile action.

"There are at least two bogus roofing companies preying on seniors, especially women, in the Middle Village-Maspeth area.
approaching the target homeowner and say they were working on a neighbor's roof nearby and noticed that the target homeowner has a serious roofing issue.
The phony roofer goes on the roof sprays a (non-waterproof) silver paint, usually taking an hour and a half and then gives the homeowner a ridiculous bill, in this case $2,250.
The scammer then offers to lower the bill to $1,950 if the homeowner pays cash.
Of course the scammer gives a bill that's pre-printed and appears to be legit.
However the company name turns out to be bogus including the license number, phone and address.
The scammers have used company names such as "Halliday Painting Roofing Waterproofing" McGavin and possibly Thompson.
They have been known to use Irish and Scottish accents.
Their trucks are new and look impressive, a dark grey capped pickup and a red pickup, both with out of-state plates.
If anyone sees these trucks operating in the area please call 911 and try and get a license plate.
Also please call the Juniper Park Civic Association (718) 651-5865 if you know other victims or attempted scams.
In the case pictured the senior could not climb a ladder to check on the work.
The scammer promised in writing to seal and waterproof roof and flashing, clean gutters and guaranteed the job for 7 years.
None of the work promised was actually done, in fact the bogus roofer spray painted perfectly good shingles.

Home prices are soaring in SoCal, but they still haven't quite hit pre-recession levels.
Rents, though, have hit those levels and kept on climbing, according to the latest rental report from brokerage Marcus & Millichap.
LA County rents averaged $1,688 a month in the third quarter of 2013, up 2.
6 percent from the third quarter of 2012.
9 percent higher than their pre-recession peak.
An M&M broker tells the LA Times "Rent growth has probably got out front of the general economy and general inflation.
The recession forced a lot of homeowners back into the rental market, but rental units are also just incredibly scarce in Los Angeles in general--vacancies were only at 3.
6 percent in the third quarter--which means landlords have a lot of power right now.
But developers have gotten the message and there's definitely an apartment-building boom underway, particularly from Miracle Mile through Koreatown and into Downtown.
There should be 6,100 new units by the end of the year and 9,000 more added next year.
The most affordable place to rent is the Antelope Valley (where rents averaged $816 in the third quarter), but if you're looking for somewhere actually livable, East LA rents averaged $1,195.
And, as always, expensive markets and expensive: Santa Monica/Marina del Rey had the highest average ($2,690), followed by Brentwood/Westwood/Beverly Hills ($2,587).

Shortly after Judd Altman discovers his wife in bed with his boss, he learns that his father has died.
The old man’s dying wish was that the Altman family — his widow and their four children — observe the Jewish custom of sitting shiva, even though he was never especially religious.
That means spending seven days together in a big suburban house, accepting condolences amid platters of food.
For Judd, embodied by Jason Bateman with his usual air of beleaguered responsibility, a family reunion following a marital calamity is a nightmare.

Like many of us, Bloomberg wonders why new subway lines in LA and New York are often astronomically priced, while Spain and China can build a similar project for a lot less money (They mention bloated projects like NYC's Second Avenue Subway and San Fran's Central Subway and add that, "Los Angeles's planned subway to the sea will be a bit cheaper, but is still very expensive considering the area's lack of density.
" Guess Wilshire Boulevard is a quiet byway; also, the train isn't going to the sea.
) Aside from the heavy judicial review allowed infrastructure projects in this country, which adds cost, America spends too much money on glamming up its train lines and stations, says Bloomberg--a new Santiago Calatrava-designed subway stop in Manhattan will cost nearly $4 billion.
Planners for LA's Regional Connector subway line in DTLA are trying to simplify the designs (see image) for their three stations, though they will include relatively elaborate street-level plazas.
Another problem: too many consultants and analysts, who have their own consultants and analysts.
The CEO for Madrid's transit agency says they would never do anything like what the California High-Speed Rail Authority is doing with Parsons Brinckerhoff, an agency that is not only designing the line, but also acting as project managers; they'll also likely build the project.
Even though Parsons has a good track record with big projects, should they stumble, it could make an expensive project even more costly.

This morning, everyone agreed, the sky over New York City was crisp and clear, like it was on The Day.
I was up early, and at sunrise, Venus, the Crescent Moon, and Jupiter, were in a wonderful alignment in the sky.
I put up Old Glory, unfurled in a Flatbush that has seen so much before, then put on my tie, and headed for the office.
The Q train was filled, crowded with workers and students.
I was proud, as some of the international students noted who stayed with us during our daughter's recent wedding, that New York City remains so incredibly, remarkably, miraculously diverse.
All of us, working folks, students, New Yorkers, headed on our way to varied points throughout the 5 boroughs to do our New York thing, and hopefuilly return home this evening.
Today, at the office, the morning included, as it always has and no doubt will among those who were there and remember, a sharing of a few stories and memories.
The tales of Brooklyn on that day remain varied and extraordinarily person personal, as for everyone.
We've told the story here, before.
This year, we will let the memories establish their own priorities as we see what the future brings.

NEW YORK (WFAN) – The Richie Incognito-Jonathan Martin story continues to be the talk of the NFL.
Martin, an offensive tackle on the Miami Dolphins, has left the team after Incognito allegedly harassed him with threatening text messages and voicemails that were racially-charged in nature.
Incognito has been suspended by Miami, and according to a report he may have played his last game as a Dolphin.
Giants safety Antrel Rolle joined WFAN co-hosts Joe Benigno and Evan Roberts in his weekly spot on Tuesday to offer his thoughts on the controversial situation.
“Richie Incognito, is he wrong.
Absolutely,” Rolle told Joe & Evan.
“But I think the other guy is just as much to blame because he’s allowed it to happen.
” Further elaborating, Rolle said he would never allow himself to get involved in such a situation.
“First of all, know something like that would never, ever happen to myself, because I wouldn’t allow it to happen,” the two-time Pro Bowler said.
“… You know, at this level, you’re a man.
You’re not a freshman in college.
So I think everything has its limits.
So there’s no way that another man is gonna make me pay for something that I choose not to pay for.
” Rolle hopes that Martin is able to get back on the field, but again, he reiterated he believes the second-year player deserves some blame.
“Hopefully he’s able to bounce back and recover from all that has happened and understand it, and take awareness of, you know, that, you’re a grown-a– man,” Rolle said.
“You need to stand up for yourself.
” Rolle added that the controversy in Miami is “absolutely not” an indication of a league-wide issue.
“Hazing is hazing,” the 30-year-old said.
“You’re gonna go through it at the collegiate level, you’re gonna go through it at the professional level.
But once it gets beyond that point and once it becomes a personal thing, that’s where the problems (happen).
As teammates, it’s extremely important that you respect one another.

CANNES, France — EVERY year the organizers of the Cannes Film Festival choose to recognize one towering figure in cinema.
This year, they are paying homage to Jerry Lewis with a special screening of “Max Rose,” the latest film for the 87-year-old American.
In it, he plays an aging jazz pianist.
For 12 days, 20 or so films compete for the Palme d’Or, arguably the greatest accolade in cinema.
Roman Polanski, the Coen brothers, Paolo Sorrentino, Steven Soderbergh, Jia Zhangke, François Ozon and James Gray are among this year’s contenders.
The festival, which started on Wednesday and ends May 26, won’t give Jerry Lewis a statuette to go home with; it never does, and doesn’t have to.
Next Thursday, Cannes will simply reaffirm the genius of Jerry Lewis to the world.
Critics in France have always been infatuated with Mr.
Lewis, who has been far less adored in his own country.
Funny thing is, the French always seem surprised when it is suggested that their love is not universally shared.
“That Americans can’t see Jerry Lewis’s genius is bewildering,” N.
Binh, a critic for the French film magazine Positif, stuttered last week, as he stood in front of me while waiting to get into the screening of “The Bling Ring,” directed by Sofia Coppola.
Lewis rose to stardom alongside Dean Martin between 1946 and 1956.
In 10 years, they made 17 films together, from “My Friend Irma” to “Hollywood or Bust,” and were the world’s top box office earners.
In 1949, the New York Times critic Bosley Crowther seemed slightly puzzled by this “new mad comedian,” “his idiocy,” “the harrowing features of his face” and “the squeak of his vocal protestations.
Lewis went solo, writing, directing, acting and producing in a multiyear contract for Paramount and then for Columbia.
Among the titles treasured by the French critics were “The Bellboy,” “The Nutty Professor” and “Three on a Couch,” but also later films like Martin Scorsese’s “The King of Comedy.
Lewis was even the subject of a book by Rae Beth Gordon, published in 2001 by Stanford University Press and called, naturally, “Why the French Love Jerry Lewis.
” To understand the genius of Mr.
Lewis in the eyes of the French, one needs to go back to the infancy of cinema, before World War I.
The French were big producers of silent films, most of them comedies.
What the French love in Jerry Lewis, the actor, writer and director, is his multifaceted moi, the meta-narrative and his extreme velocity, as exemplified in French silent films.
He took them back to their cinema history.
Think George Méliès and you’ll have understood Mr.
Lewis’s enduring appeal with the French.
Méliès, a one-man band to whom Mr.
Scorsese dedicated a film in 2011 (“Hugo”) and who liked nothing more than to mutate into new characters, shared with Mr.
Lewis a taste for split personalities, otherness and hysteria.
In many films, including “The Nutty Professor” and “The Family Jewels,” Mr.
In front of a grimacing Lewis, the French feel awe, while Americans are more likely to shift uncomfortably in their seats.
The Australian screenwriter Shane Danielsen told me last week in Cannes that “Lewis’s humor — physical, gestural, a kind of exaggerated grotesque — transcends linguistic barriers in the same way as does Buster Keaton.
” Anglophones feel faintly embarrassed by it, I think, because they feel a guilty sense of ownership — and therefore complicity.
But for the French, its nonverbal, farceur quality is something they can hook into much more easily than, say, the parched irony of a Bill Murray or the specifically British despair of a Tony Hancock.
Most Americans don’t realize that for the French, Mr.
Lewis represents an American archetype, a handsome clown and histrionic child.
The American film director Jonathan Nossiter told me, “It’s very comforting for them to believe that an American genius, by necessity, is monstrously puerile in front of the camera and an idiot savant behind it.
Lewis also offers complexity and powerful combinations of opposites: he is both a child throwing tantrums and an auteur creating a world of his own.
He was a handsome man who kept wanting to play the ugly guy, first beside his sidekick Dean Martin, and then afterward in his solo career.
He has also been a depressive clown, à la Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati.
Jerry Lewis is an auteur the way François Truffaut defined it.
Thierry Frémaux, the director of the Cannes Film Festival, who presides over the selection of films and the choice of homages, told me: “Jerry Lewis invented a singular style, uniquely staged and choreographed.
In fact, when America was celebrating the showman, the comedian, France was recognizing the artist with a unique voice and eye.
” He was a hysterical and wondrous child that France would have loved to call her own.

Dear Residents of Sunnyside, Woodside & beyond, There is an alarming proposal in the works that seeks to turn the historic corner lot at 39th Avenue and 50th Street into an out-of-place, post-modern housing development.
This corner lot falls within the Sunnyside Gardens historic district and therefore all development proposals must be approved by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC).
As a smokescreen, the developers are also proposing to move a 1931 aluminum house onto the lot.
We are a group of concerned residents opposing this development.
The manner in which this proposal is being rushed through without sufficient public notice is indicative of the developers' not having our community's best interest at heart.
This development proposal runs contrary to the community's aim of preserving the corner lot from succumbing to over-development.
Our group has other ideas for this historic open space -- namely the transformation of it into a truly public community garden and green common, while preserving its existing structures and trees.
Most of the parks in Sunnyside now are either concrete playgrounds serving primarily school children, exclusive gardens or private parks charging membership dues.
The development proposal is completely wrong for the historic district, and it's completely wrong for our community.
But the Landmarks Law gives every one of us the right to voice our choice for our future, and we need everyone to exercise that right.
Right now there are 3 things you can do to help: 1.
Please “Reply” to this e-mail to say you oppose this development.
There will be an unveiling of this development proposal this week at Community Board 2's Land Use committee meeting.
If a lot of us show up and demonstrate our disapproval of the proposal, the harder it will be for the development to win the support it needs.
This is not a public hearing and we may not get to speak, but a lot of disappointed faces in the audience will help convey our message.
The meeting is Wednesday, June 19 at 7 pm at the address below: Community Board 2 office 43-22 50th St.
(Note - this is NOT at Sunnyside Community Services) Worse still the LPC public hearing, may be scheduled for July 9.
This gives us little time to organize our opposition so we want the hearing delayed.
Call and e-mail Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer’s staff to ask them to do everything in their power to delay the LPC's public hearing.
Please leave a voicemail if there is no pick up.
Nick Gulotta, staff preservationist: NGulotta@council.

KABUL, Afghanistan — Wrangling over Afghan election results continued Sunday as campaign aides of the presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah accused one of President Hamid Karzai’s vice presidents of involvement in fraud in a runoff vote that they say was stacked against Mr.
Three weeks after Secretary of State John Kerry brokered a deal to impose an internationally monitored audit of the June 14 vote, the process came close to collapse over the weekend.
The audit had been suspended for a week during the Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr, and the campaign teams of Mr.
Abdullah and his opponent, Ashraf Ghani, argued through the weekend over the technicalities of how to invalidate fraudulent ballots.
The United Nations, which is assisting with the audit, and the Afghan Independent Election Commission announced a decision on the criteria for invalidating votes and tried to resume the audit on Sunday, but Mr.
Abdullah’s team refused to participate, citing further objections to the criteria.
Kerry made phone calls to both candidates on Friday, with little apparent progress.
Abdullah’s campaign manager released an audiotape on which he said Vice President Karim Khalili could be heard directing his followers to support Mr.
Khalili has denounced the tape as fake, according to the independent television news channel Tolo TV.
In the tape the speaker, who sounded like Mr.
Khalili but had not been independently verified as such, said that the international community, the election commission and the president all supported Mr.
He even suggested that Afghanistan’s allies would tolerate the use of any means to achieve such a result.
“Our international friends have promised us that by using any means and using any opportunity, the election outcome must turn in favor of this team, even if these opportunities, even if these means are against electoral mechanisms,” the voice said.
Abdullah’s campaign manager, Baryalai Arsalai, said the tape proved that the election fraud had been planned to return a victory for Mr.
“This evidence was released today to inform our countrymen that our president, other government elders and the so-called election commission are instruments,” Mr.
The election was a public process, he said, calling it the right of the Afghan people, not the president or the commission chief.
“We have a responsibility to let people know that their rights are being violated,” he said.

More than 700 international election observers are in Kabul, ready to conduct the 100 percent audit of the Afghan runoff election.
Under tight security, some have been diverted from hot spots in Iraq and Libya and are bunking five to a room.

We can hear the drum beats of war again.
Syria certainly appears to have committed heinous acts.
The rebels may also have done so as well.
Chemical weapons have not been the only horrific means of injuring innocent people.
Tens of thousands have died and millions of lives have been disrupted.
The use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians crosses a red line and violates international values, law, and stability.
Responses to wrongdoing must not exacerbate problems.
The UN inspectors are not tasked with discerning the origin of the chemical weapons attacks and thus more proof will be needed to give the use of force any legitimacy.
After the Iraq intelligence fiasco the U.
has a credibility deficit in the international community.
Real credibility is one element of legitimacy.
Law must also not be ignored, certainly not by a country that founds its very existence on the rule of law.
Law prima facie gives legitimacy to political action.
Without it the entire edifice of peace is placed at risk even when the moral outrage of the public is calling for action.
Presently, without Security Council authorization, coercive military intervention in Syria would not be legal.
Since the fighting in Syria is not threatening another country the circumstance of self-defense, which would allow the immediate use of force against Syria by the threatened country without approval of the Security Council, is not applicable.
The actions of the Assad regime are horrible.
Still, international law should not be set aside with impunity.
Are we left with no alternative routes.
There would be a different political dynamic if the International Criminal Court (ICC) were to determine that sufficient evidence for a prosecution exists.
If it decided that crimes against humanity had been committed, the entire political landscape would change.
Mass atrocities are not new for the Assad regime.
The United Nations Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay as far back as December of 2011 called for the ICC to investigate mass killings.
It is worth noting that she has recently called for ICC investigations of rebel slaughters as well.
There is firm legal foundations for ICC involvement.
Although Syria is not a party to the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, prohibiting the use of chemical weapons, that does not matter.
Customary international law prohibits the use of such weapons of indiscriminate effect generally and Syria would be responsible, especially if they were used against civilian populations regardless of whether they are party to the Treaty.
The use of chemical weapons is a war crime within the terms of the Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) only if they are used in an international armed conflict, which the conflict in Syria is not.
But, their use is illegal as a war crime if intentionally directed against a civilian population in a non-international armed conflict.
Such a crime can be prosecuted by the ICC.
Although Syria is not a member of the ICC, that also does not matter.
For the Court to formally investigate allegations of criminal conduct, such as mass indiscriminate killings or the use of chemical weapons, the Security Council could refer Syria, or the rebels, or both, to the Court.
References by the Security Council to the court have been done in the recent past -- Darfur in 2005 and Libya in 2011.
Even threatening such actions could have a beneficial impact.
The legal hurdles to such a reasonable course of action are not as high as the political ones.
However, advancing world security through the rule of law will provide much greater benefit than such short term political posturing that does little to stop the brutality the people of Syria are experiencing.
One problem of a referral to the Court is that if it commences a prosecution it might make the horse-trading negotiations between the various rebel groups and the Assad regime difficult.
If either faces prosecution in the event of losing militarily it could diminish incentives to achieve peace.
The status quo is worse than this risk.
It is certainly preferable to risking very dangerous unintended consequences of an illegal military strike now.
In March of 1981 I saw a spread in Creem Magazine on an East German punk sensation named Nina Hagen.
Her history was compelling enough, but it was her aesthetic that seduced me; she looked like Easter Sunday, Halloween, Valentine’s and St.
Patrick’s Day, Christmas morning and New Years’ Eve, all fused together with a deadening jolt of galvanic electricity.
From a thorough beating of bleach, dyes and fixatives, her hair — colored a flaming pink — stood on end in sharp sprays, her face was lacquered with a frenzied cosmetic of glitter and greasepaint, and over a neon blue bodysuit and white apron she was fitted with a foot-long black dildo “tail” strapped to her backside — all this from a woman who made a passionate escape from East Germany.
The next day after school I rode my bike straight to Tower Records and purchased her only U.
release to date; a four-song e.
Later that afternoon, Nina Hagen tweaked my colorless teenage existence positively fluorescent.
She was everything my senses, my spirit and my soul were starving for.
Somewhere between her grinding satanic bellow and her soul-piercing soprano I got whipped into a state of trance dancing delirium, she kicked in my doors of perception and struck me deeply in an intensely personal, nearly inexplicable way.
The raw, unbridled life in her voice transcended any language barrier.
She was pure fireworks, and the rest of my world paled hopelessly by comparison to her.
I became absolutely spellbound by this exotic, otherworldly creature and spent a significant percentage of my teen years staring deeply into the pupils of her chestnut brown eyes in the glossy photos from the pages of Creem.
scores and C-average in high school were testament to the many, many classroom hours I consumed fantasizing about the private, perfect moments we could share together.
I took German in high school for the sole reason that I might one day speak to her in her native tongue, and gave encomiastic oral reports on her both in my German and English classes.
When I caught word of a rare U.
concert date, I begged my parents to allow me to take two days off from school, and I took a Greyhound to Hollywood to catch a life-altering show at The Whisky.
Although I managed to graduate High School and lead a reasonably balanced and healthy adult life, I never did quite shake Nina off.
I continued to carry my torch; I paid ridiculous prices for her import CDs, dutifully clipped photos from magazines, and never missed a rare Los Angeles performance.
Fast forward to a strange, flukey, fortuitous evening that unfolded in January of ’95 during The American Music Awards at The Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.
I’m occasionally given tickets to big, flashy music award shows, and while they’re invariably forgettable and represent only the lowest common denominator of American music, I get the opportunity to wear all those impractical clothes I buy in anticipation of living a glamorous life.
This evening’s show was particularly mediocre — even with Prince’s pyrotechnics display, but I did sit just eight seats away from Linda Thompson, an ex-Hee Haw cast member — my very favorite TV show — which I must admit was really exciting.
As the show concluded, my friend Carol and I made our way from our seats up the jam-packed aisle and into the lobby headed for the party entrance, fraught with security.
We stopped for a moment to peruse the crowd pouring through the theater and out onto the sidewalk; the usual sea of tuxedoes, bad beaded dresses, and discernably underdressed rap artists.
Just as we began to move on, Carol fixed her gaze just over my shoulder.
“Woah,” she whispered, “Look at her…” I turned around and there she was, not more than four feet in front of me.
She stood nearly six feet tall in Vivienne Westwood black satin and rhinestone skyscraper platform heels, legs and waist wrapped skin tight in a floorlength black stretch-velvet dress, topped by a black vinyl bullet bra with a hot pink fun-fur chubby draped over her shoulders.
Her real hair was concealed under a long, jet-black wig, and she carried a bright lime green backpack over one arm.
This was the last event on earth I’d expect to find Nina Hagen.
Except for the occasional second look she’d generate from someone who undoubtedly figured she was a drag queen, the crowd moved past her without acknowledgment — clearly unaware of who she was — making their way to the Joey Lawrence worship circle or trying desperately to get a glimpse of Lori Morgan.
Much to my delight Nina was absent of an entourage and instead was oddly paired with a nondescript middle-aged man in a business suit.
They seemed to be making motions to leave.
Not about to let her slip through my fingers I bolted forward in an effort to make contact.
Real time wound itself to hyperspeed.
My body temperature dropped at least twenty degrees and everything but Nina evaporated from my field of vision — my breathing was forced and labored in my best effort to maintain a heartbeat.
I tried desperately to form intelligible sentences and managed to introduce myself and initiate uneasy and awkward conversation.
To my relief, she was pleasingly approachable and unusually friendly.
“So are you going to the party.
“There’s an after-show party in the building next door, don’t you have tickets.
” “No, I don’t,” she said — and continued with words that truly twisted my reality — “can I go with you.
” The air around me was suddenly swimming with the little blue sparkley spots I see when I stay in the sunlight too long.
She asked if she could go to the party with me.
The man she came with said he’d rather skip it, and asked her if she could find a ride home.
After what amounted to less than seven minutes of dialogue, this man, whose name I didn’t even know, was asking me if I, Matt Maranian, could take Nina Hagen, my primary object of worship for the past fourteen years of my life, home.
His question was not a difficult one for me to answer, and surprisingly, Nina wasn’t even slightly averse to the idea of being pawned off on a total stranger.
“Trust me,” I told him, “You couldn’t put her in better care.
If the meteoric impact of simply bearing witness to her wasn’t enough I was now thrown into this disorienting set of circumstances, and thrust not only with the responsibility of showing Nina Hagen a good time, but also seeing that she gets home safely.
My knees were shaking so hard I had to steady my footing and lock them in place to keep from gyrating across the floor.
She’s my ward, I kept thinking.
“Let’s step outside for a cigarette,” Nina said.
Tuxedos continued to move out of the theater in droves, valet parking attendants buzzed and jumped, cars passed, and I stood there with Nina Hagen feeling like the nucleus of the universe.
We made small talk that I was too awe-struck to follow, and after she finished her cigarette — the filter stained with black lipstick — she tossed the butt to the ground and crushed it under one satin platform heel.
I resisted my impulse to dive to the pavement, saving that butt to place under my pillow.
I couldn’t let another moment pass without communicating to her how she’s rocked my world, that she hits me hard — and I wanted desperately to reach her just as powerfully.
“Nina, may I speak to you privately for a moment.
I pulled her over to an empty corner of the sidewalk.
I turned to her, and with both hands I grabbed her firmly by the shoulders and looked as deep into the pupils of her eyes as I did into the pictures from the pages of Creem — I think I even freaked her out a little.
“Nina,” I spoke with great conviction, “I must tell you that your music has touched me as profoundly as music can possibly touch a person.
Our meeting tonight is not accidental, our paths were meant to cross…” I slowly became aware that I was behaving like an absolute lunatic, but I considered who I was dealing with and threw caution to the wind — I had two feet firmly planted in the moment.
“And you know what,” she added without missing a beat, cracking a knowing smile and dropping the register of her voice at least twelve octaves to her signature, transchannelingesque growl, “It’s gonna get even better…” This spirited reply to such maniacal gushing — and especially her knowing smile — was some indication that we were operating close to the same wavelength.
I had stepped into the evening anticipating nothing more than a cheesy show and a free buffet table but now I felt as though I had just come on to a handful of mushroom caps, and it wasn’t until then that it hit me: this is it, this is the dream date, it’s happening now.
As we made our way back into the lobby, some guy Nina knew named Irwin materialized, who wanted to join us.
I didn’t mind, he was very quiet and seemed like a nice person, plus he would give my friend Carol someone to talk to because I had all but ditched her.
The party was filled to capacity and as Nina took my arm it hit me how perfectly we complimented each other; I too was wearing platform shoes and black vinyl; we were a handsome couple.
Like becoming lucid in a dream, I wanted to test the waters.
As we maneuvered through the noisy crowd I gently grabbed hold of her arm and pulled her to a stop.
” Without question or comment she took a deep inhalation.
With our eyes slightly closed, together we chanted a loud, resonant “Ooooooooaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmm…” Party goers sipped champagne and nibbled hors d’oeuvres trying not to look our way.
“Ooooooooooaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmm…” We chanted again-it was starting to kick in.
“Namaste,” Nina said to me, putting her palms together and bowing her head.
“Namaste,” I said, and bowed back.
I got Nina a drink and we found an empty cocktail table just on the edge of the dance floor.
I failed to impress her with my German and was having great difficulty just managing with English, but I did calm myself enough to engage in a lengthy chat.
We got pleasantly toasted on vodka, and took drags off the same cigarette just like we were in junior high.
(I don’t smoke, but such an intimate act as the sharing of a single cigarette was an experience I couldn’t possibly resist.
) There was a band on stage doing ’50s and ’60s covers fit for a wedding reception and no one was dancing.
I asked Nina if she’d like to dance, and in a moment straight from the pages of Cinderella she gave me her hand and I led her to the center of what seemed like acres of empty space — I was standing in the middle of an empty dance floor with Nina Hagen as hundreds looked on.
Nina and I started moving in a free-form, Isadora Duncanish sort of way, a style completely inappropriate for the doo-wop tunes being performed from the stage.
Flailing our arms and squatting to the floor, we twisted and dipped — looking square into each others eyes — and, when I stopped to think about it, making absolute fools of ourselves.
But I didn’t care who was staring and I didn’t care what anyone thought, I was seizing this moment for all it was worth.
When the bandleader asked for couples to jump on stage and “shake their thang,” Nina pulled me right up there with her and we watusied ourselves into another dimension.
As the sax player started in on a wild solo, Nina spontaneously grabbed the mike and began wailing to a perplexed audience as band members looked curious and annoyed.
Unfortunately, as Nina quickly discovered, the mike was dead — killing the drama of her impromptu performance.
Red-faced, Nina and I jumped off the stage — wobbling on our platform shoes — and ran to our chairs giggling like teenagers.
Being publicly humiliated on a stage before a crowd of hundreds somehow brings two people closer together.
And as my hands rested on the velvet wrapped around her tight, narrow waist, I looked to the ceiling, I closed my eyes — stifling my screams — and again and again in my head I repeated I’m slow dancing with Nina Hagen — I can’t believe this is happening… Just as I was about to leave my body I was jerked back to earth by the instruction from the bandleader on stage.
“Now, I want everyone to hold your partner very close…” he said.
“…and I want you to pucker your lips…” I swallowed my heart.
Nina lowered her eyelids and gently pouted her full mouth.
“…and kiss your partner on the cheek.
” I kissed her cheek, and she, mine — and she kissed me again on the other side, unprompted.
After our last dance I escorted Nina to the ladies room and I reveled in the series of fantastical events that had taken place over the past few hours.
I needed to splash my face with icewater.
Nina returned, the party began to wind down, and it was now close to midnight.
The slow dances, the drinks, the chit chat and the cigarettes all came to a close.
Her friend Irwin ended up driving her home, and it was imperative that I sit down in a quiet place.
I had no idea how exhausting a dream date could be.
We hugged goodbye and kissed each other again on the cheek, and agreed that we’d stay in touch.
Nina gave me the number of where she was staying, “Call me.
” And Carol and I headed for my car.
A couple of times I came home to the most thrilling messages I’ve ever received on my answering machine.
But Nina is off and about and never stays in any one place for long.
Soon after she left for Paris I think, or Spain, to finish her record.
I, too, had a life to get back to and the whole experience all became very “Purple Rose of Cairo.
” In spite of her knowing smile, I’m sure Nina had no idea what that night really meant to me.
I replay the scenes over and over in my head, still slightly incredulous that fate delivered Nina Hagen into my life for a whole evening, all to myself.

Russia’s science fiction legend Boris Strugatsky died due to heart problems on Monday at the age of 79, the writer’s friend who wished to remain unidentified told reporters.
Novelist Nina Katerli, the writer’s close friend, told that Boris Strugatsky had not let his friends and those who knew him close speak with him of the disease till his last breath.
According to Katerli, the writer had blood cancer.
“It is uncertain where he will be buried, – she said.
– His brother’s ashes were scattered from a helicopter.
” Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said that the writer’s death has come as an irreplaceable loss to the Russian and world’s literature.
Friends, colleagues and admirers of the writer unanimously speak of Strugatsky as a person of high morals and principles and consider his death as a tragic loss and a catastrophe for man’s spirit.
Petersburg, known at the time as Leningrad, and an astronomer by education, rose to literary prominence through science fiction novels co-written with his elder brother Arkady, who died in 1991 at the age of 66.
Sergey Lukyanenko, a science fiction novelist, who knew Boris Strugatsky personally, explains the phenomenon of the Strugatsky duo’s popularity: “They transformed Soviet science fiction into a serious reading.
” He added that despite his respectful age Boris Strugatsky was quite active till his last days, for instance, he conducted science fiction seminars in St.
The brothers published 27 novels and novellas between 1958 and 1988.
Their works are available in 42 languages, including English, where translated titles include Far Rainbow (translated in 1979), Hard to Be God (1973) and Roadside Picnic (1977).
After the death of his brother, Boris Strugatsky published two books under a pseudonym.

More biographies on Andy Warhol have been written since his death in 1987 than when he was still alive.
I have read many of them, and as I reread my past diary entries I am also rereading my book reviews.
Without question the worst Warhol biography was Ultra Violet's rushed "tell-all" Famous for 15 Minutes: My Years with Andy Warhol, which I will surely reprint on the anniversary of the day I wrote it.
The Life and Death of Andy Warhol by Victor Bockris, however, is certainly the best biography I have read on the Prince of Pop Art.
Bockris, like Ultra Violet, was a Warhol insider who worked closely with the artist.
While Ultra Violet hung out among the druggies at The Factory and whored herself to reporters for any available inches of press ink, Bockris worked with Warhol on his book and television projects, as well as Interview magazine.
The Life and Death of Andy Warhol goes further back than any Warhol biography I know, all the way back to Warhol's family history in Slavic Ruthenia.
We learn about his parents, aunts and uncles and what immigrant life was like for Warhol's ancestors.
Bockris interviews Andy Warhol's first teachers and his schoolmates, and it is these intimate interviews that make the book unique.
Other biographers may interview only those in Warhol's contemporary circle of friends, whereas Bockris went further into the past and finally got some answers to questions that have left other biographies severely lacking.
For example: why did Warhol's mother live with him.
Other biographies have given short and simple answers to these questions, but didn't have any depth in the historical explanation.
My only regret is that there were no colour photos, and none at all of his art.
How can one publish a book about an artist, and not include photos of the works one is describing in the text.
Maybe Bockris needed the rights to print photographs of Warhol's works.
There were only a few black-and-white pictures, and they were either photos that every Warhol fan has seen before, or photos from Warhol's two brothers' private albums, which weren't published anywhere until now.
There seem to be two schools of thought when it comes to getting our kids to school drop-off.
There are those of us who feel lucky to make it out the door on time.
And then there are the ones who must get up at 4 a.
to look so impossibly coiffed by 8:30.
If you are trying to figure which kind of mom you are, there is one super quick way to tell: Just look at your feet.
If you're sporting sneakers or slip-ons, you're PROBABLY also wearing either yoga pants or pajamas.
Either way, you're the former kind.
We all judge our fellow moms -- or at least we size them up, making assumptions based on their clothes and shoes.
But is what we wear on our feet really the best indication of character.
Here are 10 kinds of shoes you’ll see on moms at school drop-off and what they say about them.
When my kids get too loud, I often send them outside.
But even their outdoor voices can be too noisy, and I've been known to come barreling out the back door to add to the cacophony: "DYLAN.
TAKE IT DOWN ABOUT FIVE NOTCHES.
" I can't imagine how I would feel if one of my neighbors sent me a nasty letter telling me the entire neighborhood was "exasperated" by the sounds of my kids playing, but that's exactly what happened to Sarah Cloutier and Guy Doré.
Someone left them an anonymous note complaining about the noise level created by their three children, two of which have special needs.
Cloutier said the letter was so upsetting, she cried when she first read it.
Sarah Cloutier's daughter Laurence, 7, has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and they believe her 4-year-old son Olivier also has the disorder.
Her oldest son, 9-year-old Antoine, does not have ADHD.
She says an anonymous letter was left in the family's mailbox last Friday, which read, The note went on to say the situation was becoming "unlivable.
" Cloutier admits her kids do scream occasionally when they play outside (what kids don't.
), but mostly interact like normal children -- and that she was devastated the neighbor hadn't come to her personally about the issue.
Obviously I can't say how "unlivable" their neighborhood situation is because I don't know what the kids really sound like, but I do know that kids who scream a lot when they're playing are annoying to be around.
It's annoying to ME when my own children scream, and that's when they get into trouble -- for one thing, I can't tell when someone's hurt, for another thing, UGH JUST STOP IT.
So I sympathize with the neighbor who is fed up with the noise.
I really do, because it sucks when you want to relax in your backyard and you're being assaulted with the earsplitting shrieks of what sounds like a pack of deranged howler monkeys.
I shut my kids down when I feel like they're getting too loud, but it's possible I have a different breaking point, noise-wise, than my neighbors do.
Which is why I really hope they'd come talk to me if it was becoming a problem, or at least send me an email.
Not leave a shitty anonymous note that insults my parenting.
It's like if I had a neighbor whose dog was barking all the time, the first step is to talk to them about it, not call the police.
I don't know if the children's ADHD contributes to the yelling or not, but since it was mentioned in the story, I'd guess it's a factor.
It shouldn't excuse the parents from teaching their kids to be quieter if they're too loud, but it might have helped the angry neighbor be more understanding -- if only he or she had talked to them instead of taking the poison pen letter route.
Cloutier and Doré say they've gone around and talked with at least 10 neighbors within earshot of their house and no one confessed to writing the note.
In fact, most people reacted with kindness, and some even cried when they read the letter.
What's crazy is they probably talked with the exact person who left the note, and they acted completely differently when they had to interact with actual human beings who have feelings.
And that's why they should have talked to these parents in the first place, because the whole thing might have been resolved without making two people -- who may be doing their best in a challenging situation -- feel so badly.
Do you think it's ever okay to leave a note like this.

From the authoritative male scientists of 1950s science fiction to the malaise-steeped dystopias of the 1970s, films about the future often betray the imprint of their times.
For its part, “Space Station 76” attempts a science-fiction parody-melodrama, outfitting a Nixon-era ship with neuroses and touchstones from countless TV movies and martini-soaked suburban tales of woe.
Liv Tyler plays a wholesome new arrival on the ship, where the closeted captain (Patrick Wilson) bottles up his rage and shame over his lover’s departure.
Others include a Valium-popping woman who’s cheating on her sensitive, robotic-handed, working-class husband; their bespectacled daughter, broken up over her cannibalistic gerbils; and a status-obsessed couple with a mother-in-law in cryogenic freeze.
The ship is a pristine version of those smooth-cruising predigital models that roamed the galaxy after “2001: A Space Odyssey.
” References ricochet furiously throughout its decks — a robot therapist (“Dr.
Bot”), lupus, VHS tapes used to record hologram transmissions.
But the director Jack Plotnick’s period re-creations make for a confounding journey.
The pointedly outdated gender stereotypes are practically highlighted in yellow, to decreasing payoffs, and Mr.
Wilson’s performance is too indebted to Will Ferrell’s pompous, clueless alpha males.
In the absence of a narrative warp drive, the characters’ snippety infighting and dippy angst don’t hit with any force.
Bot and the oblivious self-righteousness won’t delight certain fans, but this remains a protracted, scattershot comedy sketch that never quite nails its tone.
“Space Station 76” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for graphic nudity and some drug use.

From the NY Times: With its octagonal brick towers rising above the beach, the sprawling bathhouse at Jacob Riis Park in the Rockaways has, since opening in 1932, served as a monument to Art Deco design, grand public works and populist fun.
Lately, however, it has become a symbol of something else: public frustration.
Renovation work began in the 1990s on the bathhouse, which is part of the federal Gateway National Recreation Area.
Nearly $20 million was spent on asbestos removal, electrical upgrades, window replacements, new elevators and facade work.
Politicians predicted that the bathhouse would be a fitting centerpiece of Jacob Riis Park, which is nicknamed the People’s Beach, while beachgoers envisioned cafes and souvenir shops, hot showers and community space.
But the work was never finished, and today the 40,000-square-foot bathhouse appears all but abandoned.
Its large oceanfront bays are boarded up with plywood; its giant courtyard houses piles of sand, weeds and several derelict lifeguard stands, two of them toppled over.
Officials of Gateway, which is part of the National Park Service, say that the bathhouse suffered a one-two punch.
First, the money meant for the restoration did not go as far as they had planned.
The bathhouse complex actually comprises four buildings; while the entry pavilion on the inland side is finished, the beach pavilion still needs major work.
Then came Tropical Storm Irene, which smashed a series of large doors protecting the interior — the ones now covered in plywood — and dumped four feet of sand on the ground floor.
“It’s over,” said Jozef Hlavinka of Atlas Meats, which must shut down operations soon.
” A FEW months ago, the brothers Darryl and Stuart Romanoff, owners of a row of 1930s market buildings on West 13th Street, revealed plans to build a 250-foot office tower on the site.
Preservationists were not pleased.
Although the buildings are not exactly pretty, their clean, straight lines and casement windows evoke the Art Deco era in which they were built.
And like many buildings in the meatpacking district, they boast distinctive metal canopies that stretch over the sidewalk, so as to shield butchers’ wares from the sun.
Besides, their rugged looks are part of their appeal.
“They tell the story of a blue-collar New York that is increasingly rare,” said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation.
Despite the preservationists’ sentiments, the Romanoffs went ahead with their plan.
Although the size of the tower is in play — the brothers are now seeking special approval to build larger than the zoning allows — it seems doubtful that the market buildings will be spared.
The row of buildings is already mostly abandoned.
Interstate Foods, which operated a poultry market there, moved out in the fall after losing its lease.
Another company, Atlas Meats, is hanging on, though not for long.
“I’ll be out in two weeks,” said the owner, Jozef Hlavinka.
He has no lease, he said, and the landlords have asked him to leave.
Hlavinka was standing outside the packing house, where he and his employees have been carving cattle parts into filet mignon and other cuts of beef for more than three decades.
Behind him, where the poultry market used to be, you could see evidence of neglect: shuttered entrances, a few smashed windows, pigeons flapping around in the gloom.
If old buildings can tell the story of blue-collar New York, so can Mr.
Hlavinka, who is himself built something like a warehouse.
In a booming voice salted with profanity, he said he came to New York in the ’60s after “escaping the Communists” in Czechoslovakia.
He worked as a butcher in various meat markets throughout the neighborhood, including one called Old Bohemian, he said, before starting his own in 1966.
“There were 50 houses, maybe more,” he said, gesturing down the street.
“There were houses here, there, all the way down and around the corner.
” Then rents went up, and the butchers began moving out.
Boutiques arrived, and the meatpacking houses continued to dwindle — from 50 down to 40, 30, 10.
Hlavinka said, none will be left.
Still, he didn’t see the point in getting sentimental.

Sugar Bear Thompson isn’t cheating on Mama June Shannon and only signed up for a dating website to boost ratings for their reality show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, RadarOnline.
The 34-year-old reality mom, who recently had a commitment ceremony with Sugar Bear, has caught him trolling online dating sites like PlentyOfFish.

“Privately, Sugar Bear is saying TLC is using this as a ploy to get ratings for their reality show,” the source admitted.
“It just isn’t the hit that it once was…the fact that they are indeed filming right now when these cheating allegations surfaced speaks volumes.

SHANGHAI — As Apple prepares to unveil the latest iPhone this week, the company’s manufacturing partner in China, Foxconn Technology, is coming under renewed criticism over labor practices after reports that vocational students were being compelled to work at plants making iPhones and their components.
Foxconn has acknowledged using student “interns” on manufacturing lines, but says they are free to leave at any time.
But two worker advocacy groups said Monday that they had spoken with students who said they had been forced by their teachers to assemble iPhones at a Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou, in north-central China.
Additionally, last week Chinese state-run news media reported that several vocational schools in the city of Huai’an, in eastern China, required hundreds of students to work on assembly lines at a Foxconn plant to help ease worker shortages.
According to one of the articles, Huai’an students were ordered to manufacture cables for Apple’s new iPhone 5, which is expected to be introduced on Wednesday.
“They said they are forced to work by the teachers,” Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, one of the advocacy organizations and a frequent critic of Foxconn’s labor policies, said in an interview on Monday.
Li said his staff had spoken with multiple workers and students who, as recently as Sunday, said that 10 of 87 workers on an iPhone assembly line were students.
“They don’t want to work there — they want to learn,” said Mr.
“But if they don’t work, they are told they will not graduate, because it is a very busy time with the new iPhone coming, and Foxconn does not have enough workers without the students.
” Foxconn, in a statement, said that students made up just 2.
2 million-person work force in China — about 32,000 workers — and that schools “recruit the students under the supervision of the local government, and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship.
” A spokesman for Apple declined to comment on the recent cases, but he said Apple’s code of conduct tells suppliers to follow local labor laws when dealing with interns and other workers.
Foxconn has come under intense scrutiny in recent months over working conditions inside factories that manufacture smartphones, tablet computers and other electronic devices for Apple, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and other technology giants.
Investigations by newspapers, outside groups and companies like Apple itself have revealed illegal amounts of overtime, crowded working conditions, under-age workers, improper disposal of hazardous waste and, in some cases, industrial accidents that have killed four people and injured more than 100 at Foxconn and other Chinese factories that supply Apple.
Earlier this year, following highly publicized reports of such problems, Apple asked an outside organization to audit working conditions inside the plants where the bulk of iPhones, iPads and other Apple products are built.
In the wake of that audit, Foxconn announced it would significantly raise wages for many of its employees and reduce overtime hours to come into compliance with Chinese law.
In August, the Fair Labor Association — the group hired by Apple to audit Foxconn — said Foxconn had made progress at cutting employees’ hours and improving working conditions, but that those shifts would require Foxconn to recruit “tens of thousands of extra workers.
” The group also said that Foxconn and Apple had adopted policies to make sure that student interns knew they could resign from Foxconn and still graduate, and to link the jobs they performed inside Foxconn with their studies.
“I am concerned about these recent reports, and we’re following up,” said Auret van Heerden, president and chief executive of the Fair Labor Association, in an interview.
“If there have been any breakdowns in policies, we expect changes to be made.
” Worker advocates say Foxconn is under intense pressure at critical moments — like leading up to the release of a new product, like the iPhone 5 — to fill huge orders quickly.

Climate change isn't just worrisome for the Earth.
It could also be a problem for your health, according to a new 20-year study in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Researchers from the Global Health Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison looked at 56 medical journal articles about climate change's impact on health, plus air temperature information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Climatic Data Center.
They found that numerous cities in the U.
will have many more days of high-heat temperatures by 2050.
Urban areas like New York City can expect those days to triple.
And the health implications of those extreme temperatures are scary: worsening of respiratory disorders, heart conditions, infectious diseases, reduced food availability and mental health disorders such as depression and PTSD that result after natural disasters.
Reducing climate change could thus possibly reduce our nation's health problems.
In a related editorial, JAMA editor in chief Dr.
Howard Bauchner and executive editor Dr.
Fontanarosa wrote that it is just as threatening to our public health as "lack of sanitation, clean water, and pollution (were) in the 20th century.
" "Understanding and characterizing this threat and educating the medical community, public, and policy makers are crucial if the health of the world's population is to continue to improve during the latter half of the 21st century," they said.

This morning's p508 commute was about 15-20 minutes behind schedule, arriving at South Station around 8:45 this morning, I was actually dozing most of the trip into Boston, as I've been recovering from a bug, so I'm not quite sure where the delay happened.
I believe it might have been outside of Boston University.
Folks, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.
So, the delay wasn't enough for reimbursement, but speaking of $$$, I did receive 3 letters in the mail last night for those delayed trains we had to endure in December.
I love those form letters, especially where it says "We apologize for the delay due to NONE.
" Hmmm, maybe I'll try that at work and see how it flies, "Oh, I'm sorry manager, I apologize for not delivering my project on time due to NONE.
In other news, I'm pretty excited for an upcoming change in my commute benefit via work.
(I currently get my commuter rail pass via Wage Works).
I found out today that the Emergency Economic Recovery Act signed into law by President Obama this week includes a provision which raises the amount of pretax income that employees enrolled in employer-sponsored commuter benefits programs (such as a transit pass purchase program) can use to pay for transit/vanpool expenses from $120 per month to $230 per month.
How the Commuter Benefit Works The commuter benefit will now allow employees to deduct up to $230 per month from their gross income, to pay for their mass transit commutes.
This is an increase from the current cap of $120/month.
(The only way to take advantage of these tax savings is by enrolling in a commuter benefits program offered by the employer.
) Employees whose monthly mass transit fees are less than the $230 cap are allowed to deduct the full amount from their paychecks.
Additionally, employees are allowed to deduct up to $230 per month for eligible commuter parking expenses (no increase from current cap).
The measure helps employers save money by lowering their payroll taxes.
As a result of the increase in employee and employer savings, under the new law, it is also expected that the number of employees who are offered the benefit will increase, as companies not currently offering the benefit will do so.
My own pretax exposure to my $250/month T pass should go down.
QUEENS — In the wake of two sexual attacks on joggers within the past five months in Forest Park, local advocates and elected officials want the city to create a new precinct devoted solely to the park, similar to the one in Central Park.
Proponents said the spate of attacks merits a precinct that will exclusively monitor the 550-acre greenspace.
A 23-year-old jogger was Tasered and sexually assaulted in the park in March, and a 69-year-old woman was raped in the park last Monday near Forest Park Drive and Myrtle Avenue.
“It doesn’t have to be a big precinct,” said Ed Wendell, president of the Woodhaven Residents' Block Association.
“But that would guarantee police presence there and it would make the park a lot safer.
” Although the description of the attackers in both incidents is similar — both are men described as being about 5-foot-9 and approximately 35-years-old — the sketches appeared to be of two different men, cops said.
Following the first incident, police created a special two-officer police unit to patrol the park on a daily basis from approximately 9:30 a.
Councilwoman Elizabeth Crowley, who represents Ridgewood, Middle Village, Glendale and Woodhaven, and who jogs in the park, said “a dedicated precinct for the park is an idea that is worth exploring.
” In April, she also wrote a letter to Commissioner Raymond Kelly asking him to restore a mounted police unit to the area “with the option of it being stationed in Forest Park.
” The mounted unit was removed more than a decade ago, said Crowley, who is also urging joggers to run in the park with partners and stay on main roads.
Community Board 9 District Manager Mary Ann Carey said she has been advocating for a separate police precinct for the park for 10 years.
About a decade ago, she said, the community board had voted in favor of it, but there were no funds for the project.
She said the community board is also advocating to restore the mounted police patrols.
Carey noted that creating a new precinct within the park would require lobbying from residents, local civic associations and community boards.
The project would also take years to complete, she said.
“You can’t just stick a cop in the middle of the park,” she said.
” The NYPD did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the request for an additional precinct.
Critics said that the park struggles with a number of safety issues, such as lack of lighting in the early hours of the day along its main roads, including Myrtle Avenue.
“There is a good number of people who are out jogging, walking their dogs around that time and all the lights are out,” said Wendell, who said early-morning joggers have to run with flashlights at Victory Field, near Myrtle Avenue and Woodhaven Boulevard.
A spokesman for the Department of Transportation said in an email that the outage at Myrtle Ave.
near Victory Field "appears to have been caused by vandalism" and that "the agency is currently working with the Parks Department here and will also discuss potential enforcement with the NYPD.
You shouldn't neglect the details when reviewing an employee's background, but going too far could get you in trouble as well.
| Getty Images If you think it isn't necessary to conduct a background check on an employee, consider what might happen to your business if you hire the wrong person.
You could wind up with an employee who steals from you, your other employees or your customers.
The wrong employee may turn out to be violent, and, if you didn't do your due diligence, you could be sued for negligent hiring.
Fortunately, conducting the background check isn't hard, especially if you're hiring a third party to do it for you.
But even then there are many issues you should be looking for.
Here are five things you need to know when conducting a background check on a prospective employee.
Look for mistakes, not a mistake.
Employers should look for certain patterns of behavior, says Tina Chen, vice president of operations for Employco USA, an HR outsourcing firm based in Westmont, Ill.
"It isn't so much the transgression itself that should raise the red flag, but rather, repetitive behavior.
For example, employers can probably overlook an individual with one speeding ticket, but they should be wary if an individual has had five speeding tickets.
" Even if that person is going to be sitting behind a desk and a handful of speeding tickets doesn't seem relevant to the job, it could be a problem, according to Chen.
It may mean your prospective employee has a tough time following rules or is inherently careless.
Or, yes, maybe the employee simply had a bad run of luck over seven years.
But while you're right to give someone the benefit of the doubt, you're right to be suspicious as well.
More employers than ever are using credit checks on employees, thinking that's a pretty good indicator of whether they have a solid employee.
But careful how you go about this, especially if you aren't using an employment service that's familiar with all the trip-wires out there.
For instance, some states, including Oregon and Washington, only allow an employer to use a credit check on an employee if it's truly applicable to the job, such as an accounting position.
But if you want to use a credit check on your new sales team, no dice.
And according to the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, you always have to ask an applicant's permission to run a credit check.
Keep in mind that some lawmakers in states and in Congress are mulling over bills that would limit the usage of credit checks for employers.
So if you're going to ask for a credit check, make sure you have a good reason.
If you do end up running one, have a process in place to handle any bad news, suggests Michelle D.
Roccia, a senior vice president at Winter, Wyman, a Massachusetts-based staffing firm.
"With the current state of the economy, credit issues are more prevalent as more families face unemployment, which could result in late payments, foreclosures and bankruptcies.
It's important that hiring managers be prepared to understand the information in the reports, hear the candidate's perspective on what happened, and make an informed decision based on all of the information -- all while treating the candidate fairly and professionally.
A negative mark on a credit report does not necessarily mean the candidate isn't right for the job.
" For more information, check out the Bureau of Consumer Protection's report on what employers need to know about prospective employees and credit checks.
One of the easier ways to find yourself the target of an employment discrimination lawsuit is when some applications receive one kind of treatment in their background check, and others don't.
The more consistent you are with your process for doing background checks, the less likely anyone can get angry and come after you.
It's fine to do a credit check on the upper management job opening but not the telemarketer, but everyone applying for the upper management position better get a credit check.
If you ignore one young woman because she's the daughter of a vendor, and you know her background, that's understandable but stupid -- you're opening yourself up to potential trouble.
"Good background check companies should provide at least a seven-year history for any individual," Chen says.
That said, if your job applicants are way past their college years, consider leapfrogging to those days and verifying that your candidates actually did what they say they did during that time.
While it may not be a big deal for an employee who will be on the low end of the career ladder, you should definitely verify the education background of your C-level executives, those people who are going to be responsible for your company's most valuable assets, recommends Ron Williams, a former U.
Secret Service agent who now runs Talon, a security consulting firm in Sacramento, Calif.
Sure, you might think that that's overkill.
After all, if you have a worthy candidate who's coming from a solid Fortune 500 company, he or she is far past the point of needing to inflate educational credentials.
That said, even top-notch professionals lie.
In 2006, it was revealed that RadioShack's CEO David Edmondson had lied big time about his past -- his resume said he had two college degrees when he had none.
He apologized and swiftly resigned.
Bausch & Lomb's former CEO Ronald Zarrella claimed he had a MBA from New York University, but it was later uncovered that while he started the program, he didn't finish it.
(He didn't end up losing his job but wound up giving up a $1 million bonus.
) And if the financial stakes are really high, the FBI actually offers services to businesses needing extensive background checks on employees.
If something bad surfaces, follow up.
It's the nice thing to do, but it's smart, too.
You may be letting go of a great future employee by not having a conversation about whatever is bothering you.
If you're still unsatisfied by the explanation when you're done talking, you can move on to someone else and feel good you gave the person a shot.
As Roccia says: "We always reach out to the candidate for their explanation and document the conversation.
Typically, there is more to the story than what the background check reveals.

15 chat: I’m having something of a pre-mid-life crisis.
I’m 30 years old with a great job (at a company people say “wow” about), good friends, single but not bothered about it, and hobby that I really enjoy.
I do often wonder whether job is leading me anywhere I want to go, longterm career-wise, and I don’t feel incredibly passionate about it, but I really like my coworkers and I enjoy going in most days.
But lately I find I’ve been craving adventure – fighting an urge to simply pack it all in and travel the world to rediscover myself and what I feel passionately about.
I know this is partly a normal response to settling into a stable, routine lifestyle.
But I also think it must be telling me something real about my current situation (right.
How do I assess this and figure out what I want.
How do I tell the difference between having an escapist instinct because it seems easier than dealing with reality and having it because it’s truly time to shake things up in a big way.
Here’s one response from someone who has: I honestly did a double take, thinking that I somehow was you.
Same, same and same (though I didn’t love working for Wow Co, I could handle it well enough, and enjoyed my coworkers).
Don’t stress too much about metrics and PTO etc, pick a place and just go.
For me, I (almost) totally winged it.
A ticket to Central America, a backpack and a reservation for the first night in a hostel and figured that I’d figure out the rest along the way.
YMMV, of course (most people thought I was nuts and would come home dead so maybe you’d want to plan it out a bit more) but it was something about this free-wheeling, no-plans (had a bailout plan just in case), following the wind thing just cleared a bunch of other stuff up.
I realized that, yes, Wow Co was a terrible fit personally (but afforded the ability to go on such a trip)–so gained that perspective, and then eventually over time realized to jump for it, apply for the job I *really* wanted (a dream I’d let fall by the wayside) and guess what.
I’m on my lunchbreak from it right now.

BEVERLY HILLS, CA - JULY 15: Executive producer Shonda Rhimes speaks onstage at the 'How To Get Away With Murder'' panel during the Disney/ABC Television Group portion of the 2014 Summer Television Critics Association at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on July 15, 2014 in Beverly Hills, California.
Brown/Getty Images) | Frederick M.
Brown via Getty Images The scandal surrounding the New York Times' piece on television titan Shonda Rhimes keeps getting worse.
The Times' Alessandra Stanley set the Internet alight when she wrote about Rhimes last Friday.
Her depiction of Rhimes as an "angry black woman," along with her overall take on Rhimes' shows, drew intense, near-universal criticism, not least from Rhimes herself.
Cue the paper's intrepid public editor, Margaret Sullivan.
After declaring Stanley's piece "condescending" and "astonishingly tone-deaf and out of touch," she set about extracting information from the relevant parties.
The responses she received did very little to quell the furor.
First, there was the Times' culture editor, Danielle Mattoon.
Mattoon said that three editors looked at Stanley's piece, and none of them raised objections.
“There was never any intent to offend anyone and I deeply regret that it did," she told Sullivan, adding that she felt the piece was largely "positive.
" This reply drew a new round of scorn: Then, Stanley—last seen offering a very brief defense of her work to BuzzFeed—got in touch.
Here's how she put things: In the review, I referenced a painful and insidious stereotype solely in order to praise Ms.
Rhimes and her shows for traveling so far from it.
If making that connection between the two offended people, I feel bad about that.
I didn’t think Times readers would take the opening sentence literally because I so often write arch, provocative ledes that are then undercut or mitigated by the paragraphs that follow.
That didn't help either: Oh, and for good measure, Sullivan also noted that, out of twenty culture critics who work for the Times, "not one is black and only one is a person of color.
" The Times has probably seen better days.
As New Yorker critic Emily Nussbaum put it:.
They've been married for only one year, but on Wednesday Amber Rose filed for divorce from her husband, musician Wiz Khalifa.
The 30-year-old model, who used to date Kanye West, has reportedly been spending time with her new talent manager Nick Cannon, the estranged husband of Mariah Carey.
Rose is asking for full legal and physical custody of their child, Sebastian, aged one, and is allowing Wiz visitation rights.
Divorce papers reveal the couple split on Monday and cited irreconcilable differences.
Hours after news of the split broke, sources told TMZ, however, that Cannon has nothing to do with the filing.
'He only learned about Amber's domestic problems through her lawyers last week when he signed her on as a client,' said the insider.
'That's when Nick says he found out her marriage was on the rocks and only then did the two share break-up stories.
' It has also been learned the couple had a prenup.
'Amber acknowledges there's a prenup, which you would think would work in Wiz's favor, but she says it's valid, presumably, she's not challenging it,' added TMZ.
Legal papers say the prenup provides spousal support.
A source told the site the split is 'bitter.
' Their source maintains both are accusing the other of cheating.
Amber stepped out to Wolford in Beverly Hills on Tuesday without her wedding rings, signaling that her marriage was over.
That same day she posted a nude photo to her Instagram account.
On Friday she had the rings on as she attended the 10 year anniversary of Perez Hilton's blog.
And it was only two weeks ago that the short-haired star shared a touching message on her husband's birthday.
'Happy 27th Birthday @mistercap I'll love u forever.
Hope this year is an amazing one for u sweetheart ❤️' The image was from their wedding.
The two were seen in a slow dance.
Khalifa looked lost in emotion as he held his new wife tight.
Amber looked stunning in a white dress with a diamond necklace on her head.
It was a rare image but not an unusual show of love for the marrieds.
This filing comes one day after the former stripper reportedly learned several nude photos of her taken on a bed had been leaked by a hacker.
Soon after the hacking scandal came to light, Amber took to her social media sites to post a racy photo as a joke, which has since been deleted.
'Well before anyone tries to hack me I figured I’d release a brand new pic of how I actually look from the back,’ she wrote, alongside the image.
' As far as Cannon, the two have been spotted together several times this year.
The edgy pinup was seen with Cannon in July at the BET 106 and Park event in NYC.
He put his arm around her as they both held microphones.
On Sunday she brought her son to watch Cannon play basketball during a Power 106 All Star game in at USC in LA.
Just three days earlier the 33-year-old producer announced he had signed Amber to his management company NCredible Entertainment.
He previously cast her in his 2014 film School Dance.
The mogul is working hard to make his new client an even bigger star as he has reportedly already landed her a television series and a book deal.
Amber will never be able to fully let go of Wiz, though.
The model has a large tattoo of the singer's face on her left arm.
She showed the ink off in May when on the carpet with Wiz at the Ditch Fridays event at the Palms Pool in Las Vegas.

Jamie is glad he married Cathy.
But as he observes in “The Last Five Years,” the intimate musical now at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, it seems that when a man begins wearing a wedding ring, every woman who ever rejected him is suddenly interested, because he’s unavailable.
And temptation is difficult to resist.
In a perfect world, Jamie (Adam Halpin) sings, every woman in the world except his wife would suddenly “look like Mr.
” At a recent matinee performance, that line elicited the New Haven audience’s first hearty laugh.
But then “The Last Five Years” isn’t exactly a comedy.
It’s the story of a bad marriage, how things go wrong and how differently the two spouses see what is happening.
Jamie is a nice New York Jewish boy who in his search for Ms.
Right, has dated aggressively, claiming to have had Sabbath dinner, he sings, “with every Shapiro in Washington Heights.
” Then he finds Cathy (Katie Rose Clarke), an aspiring actress-singer from Ohio; the show’s second number, “Shiksa Goddess,” pays tribute to her.
The trouble begins when Jamie’s career as a writer takes off like a bottle rocket.
He has an article published in The Atlantic Monthly.
Then his first novel is accepted by a publisher, and his editor (a woman, as luck would have it) is available to give him everything he isn’t getting at home.
Cathy is not having much luck in her career.
Every audition seems to be a disaster.
Although she is blond and beautiful, she complains about arriving at an early-morning call to find “200 girls who are younger and thinner than me” — beat — “and have already been to the gym.
” Cathy can’t support Jamie fully because her self-esteem is under attack every day; she can barely muster the psychological strength to smile when she says thank you to the casting people who have just cut her off.
(To feel better, she reminds herself, “These are the people who cast Linda Blair in a musical.
”) Jamie can’t support Cathy because he’s so carried away with his own success and fabulousness.
And he refuses to have his buzz killed.
By the time he gives a public reading of his latest work — most of the show is sung through, but this section is spoken — it’s clear that a huge gap has opened between them.
Jason Robert Brown’s songs are beautiful.
Musical theater awaits its messiah, another Stephen Sondheim, and comparisons have been made.
Brown’s music and lyrics for the Broadway production of “The Bridges of Madison County” are nominated this year for the Tony Award for best score.
The original Off Broadway production of “The Last Five Years,” in 2002 (a revival opened last spring), won the Drama Desk Awards for best music and best lyrics.
Brown won a Tony for best music for the 1998 musical “Parade.
” But at some points in “The Last Five Years,” you want him to tell the story better, perhaps because the show began as a song cycle and has never fully evolved.
In fact, the storytelling numbers are the strongest moments.
In the klezmerish “The Shmuel Song,” Jamie tells of a lonely tailor in Belarus who is at peace with his imperfect life until a talking clock informs him, “You’ll get to be happy.
” In “I Can Do Better Than That,” Cathy reflects on the experiences of a high school friend who became pregnant and hurriedly married and found something less than bliss.
When the show grabs you, it grabs you hard.
Clarke have lovely, powerful voices that soar to the rafters, bursting with emotion.
Gordon Edelstein’s direction and James Sampliner’s musical direction blend smoothly.
Eugene Lee’s set, the stationary part of it, consists of two doors and a jumble of moving boxes between them.
Jamie and Cathy enter by different doors; if they exit the same way, we know from the beginning, that will make a sweeping statement.
The center of the set revolves, which with Ben Stanton’s sometimes moody lighting evokes a dreaminess in certain scenes.
Maybe Jamie and Cathy’s love story is a comment on the 21st-century alienation of the sexes.
At the end, audiences may ask: Did I miss the part where they were happy.

Those two things wouldn’t normally show up in the same paragraph.
The first is a liquid article of faith for serious bartenders the world over: a mix of 100 percent agave tequila, fresh lime juice and agave syrup that is considered a purer expression of the margarita, one that showcases the spirit.
The second is a restaurant chain famous for serving pancakes day and night.
Yet when Denny’s opened its first New York City restaurant on Aug.
29, a stone’s throw from City Hall, there on the menu was Tommy’s Margarita.
Alongside it was a Dark and Stormy, made with rum infused with a Chinese five-spice mix; a draft cocktail called the Manhattan Cream Soda, made of bourbon, vermouth, maple syrup, vanilla and acid phosphate; and a Vesper, just in case James Bond walked in.
There’s also a healthy selection of spirits available by the glass.
As one bewildered customer said the other night, “I didn’t expect Denny’s to be the spot for whiskey.
” Denny’s isn’t the first restaurant chain to try to co-opt modern mixology, but its attempt may be the most sophisticated to date.
Remove the company logo, and the cocktail menu wouldn’t look out of place at some of the more casual cocktail bars that have opened lately in Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan.
The taste of the drinks would pass muster as well.
The list is the work of Mike Capoferri, a Los Angeles-based bartender and bar consultant who was recommended to the management by a mutual friend.
The franchise owners knew they wanted a bar, but didn’t know what kind.
Capoferri suggested craft cocktails.
“There are other Denny’s with bars,” he said, “but none like ours.
” In keeping with the chain’s reputation as a “value brand,” he said, he was determined to keep the prices low (the costliest drink is $11) and the concoctions fairly simple.
“I look at it as Craft Cocktails 101.
” Talk of value notwithstanding, the item that has drawn the most attention is the Grand Cru Slam; $300 gets you a Grand Slam breakfast for two (eggs, pancakes, sausage and such), a bottle of Dom Pérignon and a “bartender high-five.
” The pairing was a bit of an accident.
In February, the franchise owners invited neighbors to a meeting, hoping to allay their fears about the coming restaurant.
Capoferri created a mock-up of the bar menu, listing the Grand Cru Slam.
“I put that on there as a kind of a joke,” he said, “and people loved it.
” He had so little confidence it would sell that when the restaurant opened, he had only one bottle of Dom Pérignon in stock.
Within its first week, that Denny’s went through a case of the Champagne.
Capoferri said the bar menu would change from time to time, adding new drinks and draft beer.
But, given the “breakfast and brunch friendly” food menu (there’s a good reason prosecco is on tap), he knows there are limits to what he can offer.
He said, “I can’t put a Negroni variation on there.

A close examination will reveal that there is no teacher listed as the 1992 honoree in the category of Social Studies.
Two of the three Social Studies finalists are listed, but the teacher who was actually named Social Studies Teacher of the Year is missing.
My name disappeared some time after I organized a public letter, signed by twenty-five American Teacher Award honorees, protesting Disney’s sponsorship of John Stossel’s Stupid in America, an ideological broadside against public education and the teachers who labor in our public schools.

More » As reported in last week’s New York Teacher, educators at Merrick Academy-Queens Public Charter School overwhelmingly petitioned for representation by the UFT, and we’re moving quickly to make this a reality.
Their action follows the recent decision by charter educators in Buffalo and Yonkers to unionize.
We often write about the original intent of charters, describing Al Shanker’s proposal for accountable schools of choice in which educators are free to innovate and exercise professional judgment.
But as the teachers at Merrick found, their voice was muted without the legitimacy afforded by a “seat at the table.
” This group of first-rate educators concluded that responsibility must be shared throughout the school community in order to generate a broad sense of ownership and high achievement.
Out of a deep commitment to their students, they acted to make Merrick a better school instead of simply seeking employment elsewhere.
These are the hallmarks of professionalism and we welcome Merrick’s employees to the UFT’s growing family.
On Tuesday, Joel Klein sent a letter to every teacher in New York.
The letter was about the TUDA-NAEP results and it built upon the misleading statements he had already made to the public when the scores came out last week.
Klein rarely writes to teachers, but who knows – maybe he sensed that his press release would not be enough to stifle the city’s dismay over the flat scores in 4th and 8th grade reading, and 8th grade math.
Or maybe he was worried that his corporate sponsors would begin to second guess their investment.
Whatever the reason, he got busy and released a Rumplestilsken letter, making fool’s gold from scores that are embarrassingly flat.

] For centuries, immigrants from all over the world have flocked to the United States for freedom of speech.
This constitutional right, though imperfect in reality, has been one of the cherished attributes of our society since its inception.
Yet our freedom of speech is severely limited in the workplace, and our work has come to erode our lives.
If we work most of the time, and cannot speak out about work, then when and how can we speak.
Many of us are anxious about speaking out; we are uncertain of the exact rules or repercussions.
Teachers speak their minds in hushed whispers in the hallways, or post their views anonymously on blogs.
Sometimes this anonymity is essential; because of the nature of our work, we need to protect the privacy of our students and school communities.
Nonetheless, in many cases the anonymity is due to fear of repercussions, not concern for privacy.

From 1010WINS: A top-ranking security official at Newark Liberty Airport is expected in court today after being arrested on charges he stole the identity of a murder victim to get hired.
For the past 17 years, Nigerian immigrant Bimbo Olumuyiwa Oyewole has sailed through background checks by the Port Authority using the name Jerry Thomas, police said.
But the 54-year-old’s secret is now out thanks to an anonymous tip that led to his arrest.
Oyewole somehow obtained the birth certificate and Social Security number of Thomas, who was murdered in Queens on July 20, 1992, officials said.
Oyewole used Thomas’s identity to secure a driver’s license, security guard license, an airport ID and even credit cards, according to authorities.
At the time of his arrest Monday, Oyewole was in charge of 30 other security guards and had access to airport tarmacs and passenger plans.
Oyewole is actually an illegal Nigerian immigrant with at least four other aliases who entered the country in 1989, investigators said.

They are worried the scam could have been used by thousands, including by some who might by terrorist “sleeper agents” working at critical locations throughout the country.
State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Education Commissioner John King are checking with school districts around the state to make sure they follow the Dignity for All Students Act of 2010, which requires all public schools to take a series of steps to prevent bullying.
Compliance to the law has been spotty — in 2013 just 20% of city schools reported any bullying at all on mandated surveys meant to track the issue.
Schneiderman said he hopes the survey — which was sent to education officials Monday — will spur public schools to take bullying more seriously.
“Students cannot learn when they live in fear of being harassed and bullied at school,” Schneiderman said.
“This survey will explore the steps New York school districts are taking to put the Dignity Act into effect.
” Districts have six weeks to complete the survey, which asks if they have posted anti-bullying guidelines and delegated the responsibility for fighting bullying to school staffers.
City Education Department officials said they are working hard to fight bullying, and each school has a variety of resources, curricula and training revolving around bullying prevention.
Bullying in city schools grabbed international headlines in June when Bronx Intermediate School 117 eighth-grader Noel Estevez allegedly stabbed schoolmate Timothy Crump to death, after months of bullying by his victim.
A subsequent investigation revealed that school officials knew that Timothy was bullying Noel, but failed to act.
A myxoma is a primary heart (cardiac) tumor.
This means that the tumor started within the heart.
Most heart tumors start somewhere else.
Primary cardiac tumors are rare.
Myxomas are the most common type of these rare tumors.
About 75% of myxomas occur in the left atrium of the heart, usually beginning in the wall that divides the two upper chambers of the heart.
The rest are in the right atrium.
Right atrial myxomas are sometimes associated with tricuspid stenosis and atrial fibrillation.
Myxomas are more common in women.
About 1 in 10 myxomas are passed down through families (inherited).
Such tumors are called familial myxomas.
They tend to occur in more than one part of the heart at a time, and often cause symptoms at a younger age.
BRUSSELS — After a series of nightlong crisis meetings on Cyprus, the European Union’s economic policy chief, Olli Rehn, remarked that his wife had started complaining that he spent more time with Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, than with her.
Throughout much of Europe’s seemingly unending economic crisis, Mr.
chief have been an inseparable part of a curious policy-making ménage à trois known as the “troika,” a trio that also includes the European Central Bank.
The tensions at the heart of this intimate but unwieldy arrangement, however, have now burst into the open with an unusual bout of finger-pointing over policies that have pushed parts of Europe into an economic slump more severe than the Great Depression and left the Continent as a whole far short of even Japan’s anemic recovery.
The blame game, initiated by a highly critical internal I.
report released this week in Washington, has put a spotlight on a question that has lurked in the shadows throughout the troika’s efforts to get a grip on Europe’s economic mess: Is it time for a divorce.
Speaking Friday at an economic conference in his home country of Finland, Mr.
Rehn, the usually phlegmatic commissioner of economic and monetary affairs, sounded like a put-upon spouse in a messy breakup.
“I don’t think it’s fair and just for the I.
to wash its hands and throw dirty water on the Europeans,” he said.
He was responding to assertions by the I.
that the European Commission, the union’s executive arm, had blocked proposals back in 2010 to make investors share more of the pain by writing down Greece’s debt and, more generally, had neglected the importance of structural reforms to lift Europe’s sluggish economy.
Rehn’s spokesman, said the report had made some valid points, but he derided as “plainly wrong and unfounded” a claim that the commission had not done enough to promote growth through reform.
On this issue and events in Greece, Mr.
O’Connor said, “We fundamentally disagree.
” Left-wing politicians who have long denounced the troika as an alien and unaccountable force are muttering “told you so” and complaining that putting policy in the hands of a triumvirate of unelected institutions could never work.
“The troika is constructed in such a way that it is untouchable, and that is the end of democracy,” said Udo Bullmann, a Socialist member of the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee from Germany and a strong critic of austerity measures that have formed the core of the troika’s policy prescription for Europe’s ailing economies.
“It has no address and no telephone number.
” He said the troika was designed to diffuse and thus dodge responsibility.
“Decisions are made in a nontransparent and nondemocratic way so that nobody has to take the blame,” he said.
Dallara, a former United States Treasury Department official who represented the banking industry in negotiations with the troika over Greece, said that the I.
and the European Commission were never as united as they often seemed and were bound to come to blows at some point.
“It is very difficult to have three cooks in the kitchen all the time.
Dallara, who now works for a private equity company based in Switzerland.
“You need one institution driving negotiations.
” The idea of yoking three together to address Europe’s troubles dates back four years to when it became clear that Greece, the weakest member of the 17-nation zone that uses the euro, would need a bailout to stave off bankruptcy.
Northern European countries, particularly Germany, demanded that the I.
play a role in order to share both the cost of a bailout and the blame for imposing tough terms.
If you ever see a typography lover, smeared with blood, bellowing while holding a steaming human heart above his head, the point of contention was very probably the use of smart quotes versus dumb quotes.
Now a fantastic new site--part Internet scold, part sympathetic cheat sheet--is trying to avert such macabre scenes.
Created by Brooklyn graphic designer Jason Santa Maria, Smart Quotes for Smart People was created as a sort of public message for National Punctuation Day to get people to start looking over the kind of quotation marks they’re using online.
Before we explain the difference between smart quotes and dumb quotes, let’s cop to something.
Design, we’re not exactly fastidious for using typographically correct quotation marks, or apostrophes for that matter.
Which, if you think about it, is kind of the point.
Even a website run by a bunch of hoity-toity design pedants, the kind of guys who can effortlessly rattle off a thousand rapturous words describing the Fibonacci sequence of some typographic curlicue.
even we aren’t using the right quotes.
Essentially, they are quotes that are (depending on the font) either curly or diagonal on the end.
“Smart quotes” instead of "dumb quotes.
" That goes for single quotes, too.
‘This’ is smart while ’this’ is dumb.
If you think about it, almost everyone is aware that quotation marks are not, in fact, vertical, but curled or diagonal.
It’s how we write quotation marks on paper.
So why do we type quotation marks on our keyboard this way.
Blame the advent of the typewriter.
As Santa Maria rightly points out, “Dumb quotes, or straight quotes, are a vestigial constraint from typewriters when using one key for two different marks helped save space on a keyboard.
Unfortunately, many improper marks make their way onto websites because of dumb defaults in applications and CMSs.
If you write a mixture of text and HTML code (as I am doing here), it quickly becomes very difficult to keep your quotation marks straight: inserting an HTML link, for example, to this delightful video of a dinosaur on rollerskates faceplanting requires me to use dumb quotes, while telling you that the title of the video is “Raptor Mascot Eats It” requires the other variety.
(It’s worth noting that this is another advantage of Markdown over HTML for web writers, since it doesn’t use quotes for syntax.
) Luckily, if you’re on a modern computer, there are shortcuts you can use to avoid the wrong quote, which is, when all is said and done, the point of Smart Quotes for Smart People.
On the Mac, this is relatively easy; it's exactly the kind of thing that would have gotten Steve Jobs’s knickers up.
Simply hold down the Option key and press [ to open a smart quote and Option + Shift and [ to close it.
Unfortunately, on Windows, it requires a sequence of five keys to appear smarter with your quotes.
Why bother with using smart quotes when everyone knows what a so-called dumb quote is supposed to mean.
Imagine you were sarcastically quoting someone at a bar, and instead of curling your fingers, you just started waving a Nixon-esque double peace sign around your head for emphasis.
People would think your brain was broken, right.
Well, that’s the way typography lovers look at you every day on the web.
Let’s do guys like Jason Santa Maria a favor and try to be lesser doofuses about our quotes from now on, okay.

Tension headaches are one of the most common forms of headaches.
They may occur at any age, but are most common in adults and adolescents.
If a headache occurs two or more times a week for several months or longer, the condition is considered chronic.
Chronic daily headaches can result from the under- or over-treatment of a primary headache.
Rebound headaches are headaches that keep coming back.
They may occur if you overuse painkillers.
Tension headaches occur when neck and scalp muscles become tense, or contract.
The muscle contractions can be a response to stress, depression, a head injury, and anxiety.
Any activity that causes the head to be held in one position for a long time without moving can cause a headache.
Such activities include typing or other computer work, fine work with the hands, and using a microscope.
Sleeping in a cold room or sleeping with the neck in an abnormal position may also trigger a tension headache.
Tension headaches can occur when you also have a migraine.
Tension headaches are not associated with brain diseases.
In 2005 the department of parks prepared an assessment report on the Ridgewood Reservoir.
The following is from the introduction of that report: "In 1984, Parks established the Natural Resources Group (NRG) with a mandate to acquire, restore and manage natural areas in New York City.
The wetlands, forests, meadows, and shorelines under NRG’s jurisdiction provide valuable habitat for hundreds of species, from rare wildflowers to endangered birds of prey.
In addition to the goals mentioned above, NRG serves as a clearinghouse for technical research to aid in the protection and restoration of the city's natural resources.
This inventory of Ridgewood Reservoir was conducted in 2005 as part of NRG’s commitment to improving the natural areas of New York City parks.
Today, the reservoir’s outer basins are filled and completely vegetated, while the middle basin contains a freshwater pond skirted by reeds.
Habitats in the vegetated areas include closed forest, scrub, woodland, and vineland.
Ridgewood Reservoir is located along the Atlantic flyway, one of the four main bird migration routes in America.
Millions of birds (as well as bats, butterflies and dragonflies) travel the flyway each fall and spring.
Natural areas along the flyway, such as Ridgewood Reservoir, provide these animals with food and shelter.
A popular pedestrian and bike path around the reservoir offers views of the neighboring landscape as well as glimpses into the reservoir.
To facilitate the protection, management and restoration of Ridgewood Reservoir, NRG completed an inventory of the area using entitation, a process of identifying and describing ecologically distinct plant communities.
Using aerial photographs and field reconnaissance, Parks staff delineated distinct ecological entities, known as entitation units, based on cover type, understory structure, species composition, and topography.
" In 2005, NRG was preserving the reservoir.
In 2007, we are preparing to cut down all the trees and pave it over.
The graphic is also from the Parks Department.

From the NY Post: Did Chuck Schumer try to use the IRS to sidestep the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling — and stick a dagger in the heart of conservative groups.
That’s the gist of a complaint filed this week with the Senate Select Committee on Ethics.
In Citizens United, the court held that bans on independent political expenditures by corporations, associations and labor unions are bans on speech.
The Center for Competitive Politics is asking that Schumer and nine other Democratic senators be investigated for trying to use the IRS to suppress the free speech of political opponents.
The complaint notes Schumer signed letters asking the IRS if it was investigating “social welfare organizations” to see if they were improperly campaigning.
Turns out the IRS did investigate.
— almost all the groups singled out for special IRS scrutiny were conservative.
So far this year, over 40 percent of thefts in New York have involved cell phones.
Chuck Schumer, it's because of all the fancy smartphones out there.
"The use of iPhones and smart phones is exploding, but unfortunately so are thefts of these expensive devices," Schumer said yesterday.
If the thefts continue apace, there will be over 11,000 phones stolen in New York City this year.
According to DNA Info, Schumer is calling on phone companies to start disabling phones remotely in case of theft, a practice that is already common in the UK and used by Verizon.
The way things currently are, thieves can simply change the SIM card and keep using the phone that they plucked from your open bag as you sat there half-asleep on the subway, or that they snatched out of your hand as you shuffled, zombie-like, down the street staring at the screen of said phone.
The NYPD offers the following tips for not getting your phone jacked: All of those sound fine, except for using hands-free technology.
Don't be one of those people with a Blueooth headset; we can't decide whether you're talking on the phone or just crazy, and we're inclined to assume it's the latter.

The Impacts of Neighborhood Poverty Deconcentration Efforts on Low-Income Children’s and Adolescents’ Well-Being1,2 Rebecca C.
Fauth National Center for Children and Families Teachers College, Columbia University Citation: Fauth, Rebecca C.
“The Impacts of Neighborhood Poverty Deconcentration Efforts on Low-Income Children’s and Adolescents’ Well-Being.
” Children, Youth and Environments 14(1): 1-55.
Large numbers of poor, primarily minority, children reside in poverty-concentrated neighborhoods (i.
, neighborhoods where at least 20 percent of residents are poor).
Emerging evidence documents the deleterious impact of neighborhood poverty on children’s and adolescents’ well-being.
This paper summarizes research on trends in neighborhood poverty, extant policies to remedy concentrated poverty, and results from experimental programs that have implemented such policies on low-income, minority families.
As a supplement to the limited experimental work on neighborhood poverty deconcentration efforts, this paper reviews research examining school desegregation and residential mobility on children’s well-being—two parallel shifts in children’s lives.
Potential mechanisms or pathways of neighborhood deconcentration efforts on children’s and adolescents’ outcomes including housing quality, neighborhood characteristics (e.
, resources, violence and disorder), family factors, and social networks and ties are also reviewed.
The paper concludes with a synthesis and policy recommendations.
Poverty rates in the United States have surged above those of other industrialized countries, especially for minority children.
In 2001, 16 percent of children in the U.
were poor, and this figure was nearly double for Black and Hispanic children (Proctor and Dalaker 2003).
Although other industrialized countries also face high child poverty rates (e.
tends to stand out in light of the contrast between the tremendous wealth in the country and the high percentage of poverty (Rainwater and Smeeding 2004).
Research has documented the detrimental impacts of poverty on various domains of child health and well-being, including school readiness and achievement, behavior problems, and mental health (for a review see Brooks-Gunn and Duncan 1997; Duncan and Brooks-Gunn 1997).
Because inadequate economic resources constrain the housing choices of poor families, low-income families in the U.
are more likely than non-poor families to grow up in areas of concentrated poverty characterized by crime, unemployment, and lack of resources.
In fact, in the late 1980s, more than 50 percent of poor children lived in neighborhoods where at least 20 percent of the residents were poor, and 17 percent resided in neighborhoods with poverty rates exceeding 40 percent (Jargowsky 1997; U.
Department of Health and Human Services 1999).
While this trend showed signs of slowing down in the U.
during the 1990s, the weakened economy since the beginning of the twenty-first century may lead to exacerbated poverty concentration not only in metropolitan areas, but also in the areas immediately outside of major cities (Jargowsky 2003).
Demographers have posited that the increase in the number of children reared in poor neighborhoods since the 1970s was due to a confluence of changes, including the mass construction of government-funded public housing in the 1950s; the out-migration of large numbers of non-poor families from urban areas to the suburbs in the 1970s and 1980s; and changes in the structure of the labor market, wherein jobs followed the affluent into the suburbs, creating a spatial mismatch between the locales of low-wage employers and employees (Massey 1990; Massey 1996; Massey and Denton 1993; Massey and Kanaiaupuni 1993; Wilson 1987; Wilson 1996).
Coinciding with these demographic changes was increased academic interest in potential neighborhood effects on children and the mechanisms by which these effects occur.
First, sociologists revisited social disorganization theory (Shaw and McKay 1942) to explain the phenomenon of crime and disorder in poor urban neighborhoods.
High rates of neighborhood poverty, residential instability, and ethnic heterogeneity were hypothesized to disrupt neighborhood organizational processes and, in turn, public order (Bursik 1988; Kornhauser 1978; Sampson 1992; Sampson and Groves 1989; Sampson and Morenoff 1997).
Second, following the lead of Bronfenbrenner (1979; 1989), psychologists began to move beyond familial influences on child development to consider more distal inputs including neighborhoods.
In the 1990s, an influx of non-experimental work examined associations between neighborhood structural variables (derived from the census or a similar administrative data source) such as neighborhood income or socioeconomic status (SES; e.
, percent poor, percent on public assistance, percent unemployed, percent professionals, percent college-educated, percent female-headed households) racial/ethnic heterogeneity (e.
, percent Black, percent Latino, percent foreign-born), and children’s and adolescents’ outcomes (see e.
, Brooks-Gunn, Duncan and Aber 1997; Brooks-Gunn et al.
1997; Crane 1991; Halpern-Felsher et al.
1997; Jencks and Mayer 1990; Klebanov, Brooks-Gunn and Duncan 1994; Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn 2000).
In general, residence in an affluent or middle-class neighborhood was positively associated with children’s school readiness and achievement outcomes, while children’s and adolescents’ behavior and emotional problems were exacerbated in low-SES neighborhoods.
In light of these developments, the present paper has many goals.
The first segment considers trends in poverty and racial/ethnic minority concentration as well as various strategies for deconcentrating or dispersing neighborhood poverty in the U.
The second part reviews three key experimental studies that have longitudinally followed families that were randomly selected to move out of public housing in economically and ethnically segregated areas.
Following this discussion, the paper presents the school desegregation literature as a body of work which parallels the limited research on neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation techniques, and thus may help to inform researchers examining their effects on children’s well-being.
In light of the fact that most deconcentration and/or desegregation techniques require participating families to move, the empirical work on the effects of residential mobility (independent of neighborhood poverty) on children’s outcomes is discussed as a way of understanding how moving may be viewed as a stressor in children’s lives.
Potential mechanisms or pathways of neighborhood deconcentration program influences on children’s and adolescents’ outcomes, including housing quality, neighborhood processes (e.
, resources, violence and disorder), family economic resources and dynamics, and social networks and ties, are reviewed in the final section.
In short, the present review attempts to bring together the extant research on the concentration of poverty and race in the U.
, techniques to assuage this trend, and how and why policies geared towards alleviating poverty at the neighborhood level affect low-income children and adolescents.
The Concentration of Poverty and Race in the U.
There have been a number of recent policy responses aimed at deconcentrating poverty within high-poverty urban communities, particularly those containing large housing projects.
Poverty concentration is linked with high rates of minority-White segregation in many metropolitan areas (Massey 1996; Massey and Eggers 1990; Massey and Kanaiaupuni 1993).
In fact, race may be a more important determinant of the type of neighborhood in which residents reside than SES (South and Crowder 1998b).
This explains, in part, why many of the court and government interventions since the 1990s have been desegregation efforts, with the primary goal of increasing racial/ethnic integration and the subsidiary goal of reducing isolated pockets of poverty.
For the purposes of this paper, neighborhood deconcentration and desegregation techniques are considered jointly.
Based on national data, researchers have documented various trends in residential mobility for low-income, minority families.
For example, when low-income families residing in poor neighborhoods moved, the moves were frequently lateral, not upward, especially for Blacks; marriage, educational attainment, and economic resources increased the odds of “moving up” (South and Crowder 1997; South and Crowder 1998a; South, Crowder and Trent 1988).
Studies have also found that expectations of moving translate into actual moves less frequently for Blacks than for Whites and that Blacks are more likely to move unexpectedly for reasons such as eviction than Whites (Crowder 2001; South and Deane 1993).
Black assimilation into affluent neighborhoods may only occur for the highest-SES families (i.
, the most highly educated and highest earners).
However, high-status Blacks are more likely than high-status Whites to co-reside with poor families (Massey, Condran and Denton 1987).
3 The limited mobility options of low-income, particularly minority, families has necessitated deconcentration and/or desegregation techniques, which typically provide poor families with low-cost housing in low-poverty, low-minority communities (Briggs 2003; Goetz 2003; Hughes 1995; Popkin et al.
The so-called “dispersal programs” have generally taken one of two forms: (1) project-based assistance or (2) tenant-based assistance.
Project- or unit-based assistance, a supply-oriented strategy, entails purchasing land and constructing low-rent, government subsidized housing in a variety of neighborhoods.
There are three main types of project-based assistance, namely, mixed-income housing, scattered-site public housing, and fair-share housing (Goetz 2003; Popkin et al.
The first type, mixed-income developments, attempt to induce higher-income families to relocate to previously disadvantaged areas through the use of housing incentives.
The second project-based approach, scattered-site programs, are commonly run by a single housing authority responsible for contracting construction companies to build single-family dwellings, duplexes, or small apartment complexes dispersed throughout a single jurisdiction.
Finally, fair-share housing programs are similar to scattered-site programs but generally operate more regionally and require cooperation among multiple agencies beyond the housing authority.
Inclusionary zoning programs are one example of fair-share housing, in which a certain percentage of units in newly constructed developments must be reserved for low-income families.
Fair-share programs have been the least successful of the three project-based approaches to move families out of central cities, as equal numbers of families move from the city to the suburbs as they do from the suburbs back into the central cities (Goetz 2003).
The second group of housing strategies geared towards deconcentrating poverty includes tenant-based approaches provided through the federally-funded Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP; previously the Section 8 program) in which low-income families are provided vouchers to be applied toward the payment of rent in private housing.
Families receiving housing vouchers are generally required to contribute 30 percent of their income for rent and utilities; the voucher then covers the remaining costs, up to a limit (called a “payment standard”) set by the housing agency.
Some mobility programs offer families special assistance or counseling to help them find housing in low-poverty and/or low-minority neighborhoods and/or to work with landlords unfamiliar with housing vouchers.
Tenant-based assistance (relative to unit-based assistance) has generally been favored in recent years due to its lower cost, the fact that participating families are allowed greater autonomy in their search for housing, its effectiveness at dispersing families across neighborhoods, and its low visibility within receiving neighborhoods (Goetz 2003).
Problems with the tenant-based approach include the lack of control over the availability of units priced at the fair market rent, the size of the units, and discriminating landlords.
Researchers examining the relative benefits of dispersion programs have noted several potential problems.
First, such programs are efficacious for society as a whole only if the benefits to the high-poverty origin neighborhoods outweigh any adverse impacts on the lower-poverty “receiving” neighborhoods (Galster 2002).
A second concern is so-called “White flight,” wherein non-minority families leave the receiving neighborhoods, subsequently leading to plummeting property values (Crowder 2000; Frey 1994; Krysan 2002).
However, a number of studies have found this to be exaggerated.
In tenant-based approaches, vouchers enable families to be dispersed among many different neighborhoods, and the public housing developed for project-based approaches is often built in neighborhoods which are already declining (Briggs, Darden and Aidala 1999; Galster, Tatian and Pettit in press; Goetz 2003).
Further, low-income families may not find middle-income neighborhoods enticing places to move to, as necessary amenities such as access to social services, transportation, and health clinics are frequently clustered in low-income neighborhoods (Goetz 2003; Turner, Popkin and Cunningham 2000).
Spatial proximity to service providers is directly linked with receipt of social services (Allard, Tolman and Rosen 2003).
Finally, low-income minority families may be resistant to moving into middle-income White areas due to potential discrimination as well as disruption of existing social networks (Popkin et al.
Moreover, receiving communities may be resistant to large numbers of low-income in-movers (Goering et al.
These issues set the stage for the following section which details three key studies that have examined the efficacy of residential mobility as a way of deconcentrating poverty and potentially facilitating the well-being of low-income, primarily minority, children and families.
For the most part, the housing initiatives outlined in the previous section required poor, minority families to relocate from high-poverty neighborhoods to less-poor neighborhoods.
Nationally, there have been a number of housing decrees in the last two decades requiring the deconcentration and/or desegregation of public housing (see Goetz 2003 for a review).
In a few cases, the programs were implemented in the context of a quasi-experimental design, in which interested families were randomly awarded the chance to move through a lottery and survey questionnaires were administered to families and children post-move to obtain information on a variety of relevant outcomes including neighborhood disorder and exposure to violence, family economic factors, children’s achievement and mental health, and relationships.
A demographically-similar comparison group, composed of families who were not selected to relocate out of the high-poverty origin neighborhoods, also responded to the surveys.
Since random assignment of families to neighborhood type (i.
, poor or less poor) is utilized, these key studies of residential mobility provide empirical evidence of deconcentration and/or desegregation efforts, specifically, and neighborhood effects, in general, on children.
In the present paper, three residential mobility programs are highlighted: (1) the Gautreaux Program in Chicago; (2) the Yonkers (NY) Project; and (3) the quasi-experimental Moving to Opportunity (MTO) for Fair Housing Demonstration in five U.
Although similar in scope, each of the three residential mobility programs have differences ranging from the implementation of the mobility reform (i.
, unit-based versus tenant-based) to the types of receiving neighborhoods (e.
, suburban versus urban, racially heterogeneous versus homogeneous).
Both Gautreaux and Yonkers stemmed from court-ordered desegregation mandates, whereas MTO was sponsored by the government as a demonstration program.
As a result, families in the experimental group in MTO did not necessarily move to primarily White neighborhoods.
For each of the key studies, a brief description of the study context is provided, followed by a summary of the main findings on families’ and children’s outcomes.
More detailed information on the specific study designs and samples for the three studies are found in the Appendix.
See Table 1 for a summary of findings to date.
Summary of Implementation and Design and Program Impacts for Three Key Residential Mobility Studies Context The Gautreaux Program in Chicago stemmed from a 1976 court order to desegregate Chicago’s public housing projects, located primarily in the city’s Black South Side.
The court order decreed that 7100 Section 8 vouchers, applicable towards private rental housing within the entire Chicago metropolitan area, were to be provisioned to low-income Black families living in and on the waiting list for public housing.
At the outset, it was authorized that 75 percent of the families must relocate out of the city limits to the suburbs; by 1991, all families were required to move to the suburbs.
Additionally, 75 percent of families could not relocate to communities where 30 percent or more of the residents were Black.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) began relocating families in 1981 and reached its goal of relocating over 7,000 families by 1998.
Selected families were screened for eligibility based on standard criteria which included household size, rent-paying history, and housekeeping.
Families were assigned to housing on a first-come, first-served basis within Chicago or one of its suburbs in a random fashion, as units became available.
On average, one-fifth of eligible, enrolled families actually moved.
Reasons given for the low take-up rate include families’ unwillingness to move out of their familiar communities as well as residents’ inability to find housing in the allotted time (Rubinowitz and Rosenbaum 2000).
In order to assess the impacts of this historic program on residents’ neighborhood safety, families’ economic circumstances, children’s school experiences and achievement, and families’ access to social ties, two quasi-experimental studies were carried out, in which families who relocated to suburban, primarily White, middle-class areas (“suburban movers”) were compared with similar families who moved within the city (“city movers”) and essentially remained in poor neighborhoods (Rosenbaum 1995; Rubinowitz and Rosenbaum 2000).
The following section briefly summarizes key findings.
Findings In terms of neighborhood safety, fewer suburban than city residents experienced violence including robberies, rape, assaults, and gang violence.
Analyses also revealed that significantly fewer suburban movers believed that their new neighborhoods were dangerous compared with city movers (Rubinowitz and Rosenbaum 2000).
Administrative data using 1980 and 1990 census data corroborated this finding as both violent and property crime rates were lower in suburban versus city neighborhoods (Keels et al.
Adults who moved to the suburbs as part of the Gautreaux Program obtained employment at higher rates than adults who remained in the city; moving to the suburbs, however, was not significantly associated with improvement in adults’ hourly wages (Rosenbaum and Popkin 1991).
Short-term school-related outcomes were examined for children as young as six years of age.
According to parents, moving to the suburbs was positively associated with children’s placement in special education classrooms during the first years of program participation (Rosenbaum, Kulieke and Rubinowitz 1988).
Parents who moved to the suburbs also reported that the schools in their catchment area had higher standards compared with their children’s old schools, which may explain the higher rates of special education placements (Rosenbaum, Kulieke and Rubinowitz 1988).
In spite of these differences, suburban movers’ school performance matched that of the city movers in the short-term.
Over time, however, suburban movers were less likely to drop out of high school and were more likely to enroll in college preparatory classes and attend college than city movers (Kaufman and Rosenbaum 1992; Rosenbaum 1995).
As detailed in Rosenbaum et al.
(1991) and Rubinowitz and Rosenbaum (2000), while suburban movers had more informal contact (e.
, talking on the phone, babysitting, eating) with neighbors than city movers at the outset, moving to the suburbs was also positively associated with the number of times residents were treated badly by neighbors in the first year after moving; this effect attenuated over time (i.
, within approximately six years following moves).
Furthermore, data from the same study revealed that the groups did not differ in the number of neighborhood friends they possessed, but suburban movers had significantly more White friends and significantly fewer Black friends than city movers (Rosenbaum 1995; Rosenbaum et al.
Similarly, in terms of children’s social interactions, the size of children’s social circles did not differ by neighborhood environment and, approximately ten years following moves, city and suburban children felt equally socially integrated in their environments (Rosenbaum 1995).
Based on the results from the two studies examining subsamples of the more than 7,000 low-income Chicago families who relocated as part of the court ordered Gautreaux Program, suburban movers clearly benefited from the economically and racially integrated settings their moves afforded, especially in the long term.
While suburban residents faced some racial harassment at the outset and children were more likely to be separated out of mainstream classrooms in the early 1980s, approximately ten years following relocation, these effects were attenuated.
Findings based on the two demographically similar groups of movers indicate that relocating to more advantaged neighborhoods in the Chicago metropolitan area boded well for children’s long-term success.
Context The City of Yonkers, New York, just north of New York City in Westchester County has been the host of a rather large social experiment for the last two decades due to long-standing segregation.
By the mid-1980s, 50 percent of the residents residing in neighborhoods in the Southwest section of the city were poor and more than 60 percent were minority, living in dilapidated public housing projects or low-rent apartments (Briggs 1997; Briggs, Darden, and Aidala 1999).
In response to the economic and racial segregation, a 1985 federal court ruling mandated desegregation of public housing by providing new housing opportunities to low-income residents (United States v.
Beginning in 1990, 200 two-story scattered-site publicly funded townhouses (14 to 48 units per site with separate entryways and backyards) were constructed in six primarily White, middle-income areas of the city.
Families currently living in southwest Yonkers in public housing (50 percent) and on the waiting list for public housing (50 percent) who met the standards set forth by the Housing Authority were selected via lottery to move into the new public housing units between 1990 and 1993 (“movers”).
An in-place control group of demographically similar residents who remained in southwest Yonkers (“stayers”) was also recruited.
All families were interviewed in their home approximately two and seven years following relocation; details on the study design and sample are provided in the Appendix.
Currently, short-term findings based on the two-year interviews are available.
Recent papers by Fauth, Leventhal, and Brooks-Gunn (2004; in press) examined the differences between families that moved from high- to low-poverty neighborhoods and families that remained in the original high-poverty neighborhoods on a number of relevant outcomes including neighborhood disorder and violence, families’ economic resources, parents’ mental health, children’s behavior problems and delinquency, and the neighborhood social climate.
Findings In terms of neighborhood characteristics, both adults and children who moved to low-poverty neighborhoods reported less of neighborhood disorder (e.
, presence of gangs in neighborhood) and violence than their demographically similar counterparts who remained in high-poverty neighborhoods.
Youth who moved reported less access to illegal substances in their neighborhoods than youth who remained in high-poverty neighborhoods.
Moving to a low-poverty neighborhood appeared to benefit families economically.
Compared to stayers, mover adults were more likely to be employed and less likely to receive welfare.
In terms of adults’ health findings in the short-term, mover adults reported fewer physical health and alcohol abuse symptoms compared with adults who remained in high-poverty neighborhoods.
In the short-term, however, moving did not lead to differences in adults’ depression or anxiety.
Youth who moved from high- to low-poverty neighborhoods reported more behavior problems, delinquency, and family relationship problems than their peers who remained in the original, high-poverty neighborhoods.
These impacts were strongest for older youth (e.
Short-term impacts on participants’ social outcomes revealed that adults who moved reportedly engaged in less informal socializing with their neighbors than stayer adults.
In conclusion, the short-term results garnered from the Yonkers Project are mixed.
Overall, adults in the sample responded well to moves as evidenced by their improved economic and health-related outcomes.
Youth, however, reported more behavior problems following moves compared with their peers who did not relocate.
Data from the seven year follow-up, recently conducted, will provide much needed information on the well-being of these families in terms of whether the advantaged neighborhood conditions experienced by the movers led to subsequent improvements in their well-being.
The Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing Demonstration Context With the findings from the Gautreaux Program as the impetus, the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program, a housing relocation program sponsored by HUD, commenced in the early 1990s (Goering 2003; Goering and Feins 2003).
cities including Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City residing in public housing or receiving housing assistance under the Section 8 program and who had at least one child under 18 years of age were eligible to participate; participants were primarily Black and Latino.
Housing projects from which participants were recruited were located in census tracts with poverty rates in excess of 40 percent, as measured by the 1990 U.
A randomized controlled design was used such that families who volunteered for the program were assigned to one of three conditions: (1) the experimental group who received Section 8 housing vouchers and special assistance to move only to low-poverty neighborhoods (less than 10 percent poor according to 1990 U.
Census); (2) the Section 8 group who received housing vouchers under the regular, geographically unrestricted program and no special assistance; or (3) the in-place control group who did not receive vouchers or special assistance but continued to receive project-based support.
5 For the purposes of this paper, differences between experimental and in-place control families are highlighted.
Baseline interviews were conducted from 1994 to 1999, prior to random assignment and relocation of movers, with follow-up studies conducted approximately three and six years later (for the three-year evaluation, site-specific studies were conducted by different teams of researchers contracted by HUD).
The present review focuses primarily on findings from the Baltimore, Boston, and New York City three-year evaluations as these studies focused on adult and child outcomes.
Preliminary findings from the six-year interim evaluation are also summarized; details about the evaluation studies are found in the Appendix.
Findings In terms of neighborhood characteristics, analyses revealed that experimental neighborhoods were significantly safer (Boston) and less crime-ridden (Boston) and disordered (New York City) than control neighborhoods (Katz, Kling and Liebman 2001; Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn 2003).
These neighborhood improvements for experimental families were sustained over time (Orr et al.
Across MTO sites, minimal economic benefits were conferred on adults who moved from high- to low-poverty neighborhoods.
In the short term, experimental adults were less likely to report experiencing distress symptoms and depressive problems than in-place controls (Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn 2003).
These effects were sustained over time across all sites in the six year interim evaluation (Orr et al.
Neighborhood effects on children’s achievement were the focus of two short-term MTO studies in Baltimore and New York City.
The two studies revealed somewhat conflicted findings.
Evidence from the Baltimore evaluation revealed improvements in five- to 12-year old experimental children’s achievement (relative to in-place control children) approximately three years following moves.
For 13- to 18-year old experimental youth in the same study, however, increases in grade repetition and school discipline were revealed (Ludwig, Ladd and Duncan 2001).
Evidence from the New York City MTO found increased achievement test scores and time spent on homework among 11- to 18-year old experimental male youth, but increases in grade repetition among six- to ten-year old experimental boys (Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn in press).
Minimal educational impacts were found across all sites in the six-year interim evaluation (Orr et al.
In terms of children’s behavior problems and/or delinquency in the short term, children in the experimental groups in Boston and New York City exhibited fewer behavior problems (e.
, behavior at home and at school, cruelty to others, and feeling unhappy, sad, or depressed) than in-place controls (Katz, Kling and Liebman 2001; Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn in press).
The Baltimore evaluation more closely examined male delinquency via data from the Department of Juvenile Justice and found that for one to one-and-a-half years following randomization, experimental male adolescents were less likely to be arrested for violent crimes, especially robbery, relative to in-place controls (Ludwig, Duncan and Hirschfield 2001).
There is evidence that experimental males demonstrated higher rates of property crime arrests compared with controls, possibly due to more stringent policing in low-poverty neighborhoods.
At the time of the interim evaluation approximately six years following relocation, decreases in behavior problems and delinquency were seen only for experimental girls (relative to controls), with some indication that experimental boys were reporting more behavior problems and property crimes relative to control boys (Orr et al.
Only the MTO-Boston site evaluation examined early program impacts on residents’ social relationships and found some evidence that experimental female children were more socially isolated than in-place controls (Katz, Kling and Liebman 2001).
In general, it is difficult to synthesize the available evidence from the MTO Demonstration as the earlier research focused on site-specific evaluations, while the six-year evaluation aggregated findings across all five sites.
Over time, few educational program effects were found, possibly due to the fact that most experimental children (approximately 75 percent) remained in the same school district following moves (Orr et al.
Approximately six years following moves, experimental girls appeared to benefit from moves in terms of their improved mental health relative to in-place control girls.
Experimental boys, however, did not experience the same benefits.
Findings from the final evaluation slated ten years after families’ relocation will complement the long-term Gautreaux findings.
Based on findings from the three key residential mobility studies, it appears that neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation efforts that attempt to relocate disadvantaged minority families living in impoverished neighborhoods to relatively middle-class, White neighborhoods may actually be detrimental to children at the outset.
In particular, findings from the Gautreaux Program and the Yonkers Project revealed some initially negative impacts on children who moved.
In Gautreaux, however, children who moved to the suburbs in the study had better educational and employment outcomes, relative to city dwellers, in the long term.
Long-term evidence from the Yonkers Project is not yet available.
In the short term, children who were assigned to move to low-poverty neighborhoods as part of the MTO Demonstration exhibited fewer behavior problems than children who did not move.
It is possible that these moves were easier to adjust to (relative to children in Gautreaux and Yonkers) because the experimental families in MTO relocated to ethnically diverse (approximately one-third White) rather than primarily White neighborhoods.
Thus, the period of adjustment for families that move as a result of neighborhood poverty deconcentration initiatives may be related to the demographic make-up of the neighborhood, and favorable outcomes may not be found in the years immediately following such moves.
Another factor with the potential to impact neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation programs’ effects on outcomes is families’ subsequent mobility.
That is, the potential benefits of an upward move may be thwarted if families who relocated to low-poverty neighborhoods later move back to high-poverty, minority neighborhoods.
This did not appear to occur with Gautreaux families, as a recent article reported that the SES and racial/ethnic composition of the initial placement was similar to that of subsequent neighborhoods (DeLuca and Rosenbaum 2003).
In MTO, follow-up analyses examining experimental families’ neighborhoods in 2001 revealed that of the families that actually used their housing vouchers to move to low-poverty neighborhoods, nearly 67 percent of them remained in neighborhoods with poverty rates less than 10 percent (Feins 2003).
However, among all families assigned to the experimental group regardless of whether they moved, only 32 percent of these families lived in low-poverty neighborhoods.
Thus, approximately six years following the implementation of MTO, a number of families assigned to the experimental group resided in higher-poverty neighborhoods.
Clearly, this subsequent relocation could minimize potential program benefits on participating families.
Review of the Impacts of School Desegregation on Children’s and Adolescents’ Well-Being Due to the limited experimental and quasi-experimental research examining neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation techniques on children’s outcomes, a brief review of the school desegregation literature is presented.
Like neighborhood deconcentration efforts, school desegregation initiatives necessitate changes in children’s daily environments.
Two trends of these school-based reforms that may inform neighborhood-based efforts are highlighted, namely, the timing of implementation and the timing of effects (i.
Impacts of school desegregation on participants’ outcomes may vary according to the timing of implementation and/or the number of years children spend in an integrated versus a segregated school.
Early implementation and more years in an integrated setting lead to larger and more positive linkages with outcomes.
Two ambitious meta-analyses compiling research on desegregation found larger positive effects on academic achievement for children who experienced desegregation during elementary school versus high school (Crain and Mahard 1983).
Furthermore, one extensive study of a desegregation effort in St.
Louis, Missouri revealed that among a sample of Black high school students attending White schools for the first time, the minority students were overrepresented in the lowest academic tracks (Wells and Crain 1997).
The impacts of early desegregation may be due to a smaller academic gap between the minority and majority children in younger years, as well as less fear or prejudice of minority children by Whites in elementary school relative to high school children (Scott and McPartland 1982; St.
Many experts on school desegregation urge that efficacy should be measured by long-term effects (Jencks and Mayer 1990; St.
John 1975; Wells and Crain 1997).
Studies have found that effects on children’s achievement assessed less than one year following implementation of school desegregation are smaller than the effects found when outcomes are assessed at least one year following implementation (Crain and Mahard 1983).
School desegregation has in fact been most consistently associated with longer-term outcomes including the findings that children who attend desegregated schools tend to attend predominately White colleges, to form integrated social and professional networks, and to have white collar or professional jobs (Braddock 1980; Dawkins 1994; Wells and Crain 1994).
One study found that the percentage of White students in mothers’ high schools was associated with nearly a two-point increase in their elementary school aged children’s vocabulary scores above and beyond the impacts of maternal IQ and past achievement (Phillips et al.
Research has also shown that Blacks who attend desegregated elementary and secondary schools are more likely to have higher and more realistic educational aspirations than segregated Black students (Jencks and Mayer 1990; Wells 1995).
It must be noted, however, that studies using more sophisticated analytic techniques including statistical controls for individual and background demographic characteristics have found weak associations between school desegregation, youths’ achievement test scores and school attainment, and adults’ earnings, especially in comparison with the impacts of school quality on such outcomes (Rivkin 2000; Whitfield and Wiggins 2003).
This may be due to the fact that the proportion of White pupils in U.
public schools has declined dramatically since 1990s, leading to an increase in “majority minority” schools (Logan 2004).
The fact that school quality may supercede the direct impacts of desegregation efforts on children’s outcomes highlights the importance of providing high-quality services to low-income and minority families.
Research on housing quality, which is most relevant for neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation efforts, is discussed in a later section.
In general, school desegregation produces positive adult outcomes when programs are implemented when children are young (i.
, during elementary school) (see Table 2 for a summary of impacts).
It follows that implementing neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation initiatives early in children’s lives may be most advantageous; this would compliment the non-experimental evidence documenting positive associations between neighborhood SES and children’s outcomes as young as three years of age.
Although school desegregation does not impact children until they are at least five years of age, neighborhood policies can play an earlier role.
Furthermore, the fact that favorable long-term effects have been found in the school desegregation literature matches the long-term findings from the Gautreaux Program (Kaufman and Rosenbaum 1992; Rubinowitz and Rosenbaum 2000).
Summary of Impacts of School Desegregation on Children’s Well-Being The Impact of Residential Mobility on Children’s and Adolescents’ Well-Being Moving is a key piece of mobility programs; independent of other factors, it may be disruptive to children and youth and thus negatively impact their outcomes.
There exists an extensive body of research which examined the effects of residential mobility on children’s achievement, mental health, and social outcomes, although many of these studies are descriptive in nature and do not statistically control for potentially confounding variables (e.
, race/ethnicity, family SES, etc.
A review of the findings, however limited, follows including a summary of research that has examined the different types of moves (e.
, long versus short distance, opportunity versus necessity moves, etc.
) children experience and how these variables may moderate (or mediate) associations between moving and their well-being.
Figure 1 highlights potential moderators of residential mobility on children’s outcomes.
This section presents findings on school readiness and achievement first, followed by impacts on behavior and emotional problems.
Summary of Potential Moderators of Residential Mobility on Children’s and Adolescents’ Well-Being A number of studies documented negative associations between the number of moves experienced by children since kindergarten and their achievement, measured as early as first or second grade.
A few studies have also found negative mobility effects on other school-related outcomes including school behavior problems and attendance, but findings in this domain are less consistent than those for achievement.
This section reviews the extant literature in more detail.
One Denver area study found that children in the most unstable mobility groups (e.
, those that transferred more than two times in one year) were experiencing the lowest achievement test scores compared with more stable children, and this effect was strongest in the lower grades (Ingersoll, Scamman and Eckerling 1989).
These negative impacts may not dissolve over time, as studies have documented that early moves (e.
, during elementary school) were negatively associated with children’s future school performance as late as middle school or even high school (Pribesh and Downey 1999; Temple and Reynolds 1999).
Studies have also demonstrated that mobility-achievement associations are influenced by children’s social adjustment following moves (Pribesh and Downey 1999; Swanson and Schneider 1999).
In terms of alternate school-related outcomes, a number of studies using the National Health Interview Survey of Child Health data, which surveyed children from all age groups, found that the odds of exhibiting academic-behavioral problems including grade repetition, disobedience in school, and suspensions/expulsions were higher for children who moved even one time during their childhood compared with children who did not move at all, especially for children from single-parent families (Simpson and Fowler 1994; Tucker, Marx and Long 1998).
Among young school age children in another study, moving more than two times between the beginning of kindergarten and the end of first grade was positively related with children’s absenteeism and their school adjustment problems (Nelson, Simoni and Adelman 1996).
Residential mobility may also be associated with children’s educational attainment, which has long-term implications for children’s future career opportunities.
According to a number of studies, the odds of high school dropout were increased for children who have experienced family moves (Coleman 1988; Rumberger and Larson 1998; Swanson and Schneider 1999), especially when the moves occur during early childhood (Haveman, Wolfe and Spaulding 1991) and for children residing in single-parent and stepfamilies versus two-parent, intact families (Astone and McLanahan 1994).
On the other hand, a Toronto-based study reported that moving had a significant, positive association with college completion and education attainment, especially for youth with supportive mothers and participating fathers (Hagan, MacMillan and Wheaton 1996).
Finally, studies have examined variables occurring concomitantly with moving including the geographical distance of the move and existing risk factors.
A number of studies found that shorter-distance, intracity moves were associated with less favorable outcomes compared with longer distance, extracity moves (Alexander, Entwisle and Dauber 1996; Johnson and Linblad 1991; Tucker, Marx and Long 1998).
Along the same lines, an older study of primarily minority youth from across the country found that local moves (i.
, intrastate or intraregion) were negatively associated with school progress when household head educational attainment was low; longer distance moves yielded no associations with school progress, regardless of background characteristics (Straits 1987).
When it occurs concurrently with other risks and/or transitions including school change, puberty, and family disruption, moving may be viewed as an additional risk factor associated with unfavorable outcomes (Felner, Primavera and Cauce 1981; Scanlon and Devine 2001; Simmons et al.
Finally, research has found that mobility may exacerbate poor academic outcomes for psychiatric inpatient or maltreated children (Eckenrode et al.
Residential mobility is also associated with children’s behavior and emotional problems.
Similar to the findings assessing achievement outcomes, moving, even at a young age, is negatively associated with favorable behavioral and mental health outcomes, especially for highly mobile children.
More prevalent for outcomes in this domain than for achievement, children’s individual personality traits as well as their support networks may moderate (or mediate) the impacts of residential mobility on children’s behavior and emotional problems.
Studies have found that mobility occurring early in children’s school careers was associated with increased parent- and teacher-reported behavior problems measured when children were in first grade, especially for children who moved more than one time between preschool and first grade (Ackerman et al.
1999b; Nelson, Simoni and Adelman 1996).
Among older children, two studies have found positive associations between residential moves and adolescent girls’ depression (Brown and Orthner 1990) and adjustment problems (Adam and Chase-Lansdale 2002).
In terms of more severe outcomes, two studies using data from approximately 10,000 six- to 17-year old children who participated in the National Health Interview Survey of Child Health reported that children who moved six or more times were 77 percent times more likely to have experienced four or more behavior problems than their peers who did not move at all or moved infrequently; similar, yet attenuated, effects were found for children who moved one to three times versus nonmovers (Simpson and Fowler 1994; Wood et al.
A study of 250 12- to 18-year old psychiatric inpatients revealed that youth in the moderate-mobility (two to four moves to or from psychiatric care) and high-mobility (five to 20 moves) groups were more likely than their low-mobility counterparts to be diagnosed with conduct disorder (Mundy et al.
Among older female youth, moving was positively associated with the odds of having intercourse even after controlling for a number of relevant variables including rural/urban geography, religiosity, father’s educational attainment, number of sexually active girlfriends, and race (Stack 1994).
Children’s individual personality characteristics may moderate associations between moving and their emotional and behavioral outcomes, indicating that residential moves may be particularly hard for certain types of children.
One small study of children enrolled in Head Start and their mothers revealed that children’s emotional intensity, which is similar to temperament, moderated the associations between residential instability and maternal reports of children’s behavior problems, depression, and social isolation.
Results revealed that children low on emotional intensity had more problems and that highly emotionally intense preschoolers had fewer problems (Stoneman et al.
Similarly, a study of high school children found that the positive impact of frequent mobility on youths’ depression scores held only for shy students (Norford and Medway 2002).
According to these studies, less emotionally reactive children and shy children experienced the most difficulty adjusting to residential moves.
Aside from individual characteristics, parental and peer social support may attenuate negative associations between moving and adolescents’ behavior or emotional outcomes (Hendershott 1989; Sampson and Laub 1994).
A Canadian study of 10- to 11-year olds found that the positive association between frequent relocation and problem behavior (e.
, aggression, alcohol use, delinquency) was diminished among children who exhibited high family and school attachment, and was exacerbated for children with parents who displayed inconsistent or harsh caregiving practices (DeWit, Offord and Braun 1998).
One study reported null associations between objective aspects of moving (e.
, months since last move, location of move) and youths’ adjustment, yet their difficulty making new friends following residential moves was associated with less favorable outcomes (Pittman and Bowen 1994).
Similarly, a study of higher-SES adolescents revealed that mobile boys had less contact with friends and experienced more rejection than non-mobile boys.
Furthermore, mobile boys and girls scored lower on assessments of friendship qualities including sharing and intimate self-disclosure than non-mobile teenagers (Vernberg 1990).
Finally, children’s self-concept scores declined linearly with the distance moved for a group of middle-class high school children (Kroger 1980).
Research has indicated that children with above average mobility histories are more likely to reside in single-parent families, to be poor and receive public assistance, and reside in households where the head has less than a high school education (Benson et al.
1995; Long 1992; Rumberger and Larson 1998).
Furthermore, there is some indication that children from high-SES families were more likely to make longer-distance moves than low-SES children, perhaps indicating that the more affluent families were moving in response to better opportunities (Alexander, Entwisle and Dauber 1996; Family Housing Fund 2001; Goebel 1981; Lacey and Blane 1979; Nelson, Simoni and Adelman 1996).
Frequent residential mobility may not be in and of itself associated with deleterious outcomes for children, especially if the move is opportunity-oriented.
It is a bit difficult to discern the implications of this literature on the low-income, minority families participating in residential mobility programs.
On the one hand, the families, by nature of the program, moved to less poor or even middle-class neighborhoods, which should facilitate children’s well-being.
Yet, the relocation could be construed as another risk factor in addition to poverty, ethnic minority status, residence in female-headed households, and low maternal education in these children’s lives.
Furthermore, at the outset, these moves may have been difficult for targeted families as they were required to move to low-poverty and, in some cases, primarily White neighborhoods where they were obviously the minority.
Clearly, children’s perceptions of the move, relationships with family and friends, and experiences following moves affect their adjustment to this change.
Pathways of Neighborhood Poverty Deconcentration Programs on Children’s and Adolescents’ Well-Being The research presented in the previous section highlights research on the impacts of poverty deconcentration and/or residential desegregation, school desegregation, and residential mobility on children’s and youths’ outcomes.
While informative, this research review did not describe the potential mechanisms through which the impacts of neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation strategies may be transmitted to children.
The following section reviews a number of these pathways.
There are four primary paths through which neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation initiatives may affect children and youth.
These include improvements in housing quality, changes in neighborhood characteristics, impacts on family economic resources and dynamics, and adjustments in social climate including social networks and ties.
Housing conditions and quality- including safety, cleanliness, space allocation (e.
, crowding), lighting, and décor- may impact low-income families’ outcomes (Bradley 1995; Caldwell and Bradley 1984).
Moreover, these factors may be responsible, in part, for the neighborhood effects on children generated by housing deconcentration and/or desegregation programs.
In general, residence in a neighborhood with a high proportion of poor residents is negatively associated with the physical quality of home environments (Evans and Kantrowitz 2002; Klebanov, Brooks-Gunn and Duncan 1994).
Experimental and non-experimental studies have documented associations between neighborhood SES and children’s health outcomes (e.
, injuries, asthma), which may be due, in part, to the physical quality of homes and the immediate environs (Carr, Zeitel and Weiss 1992; Durkin et al.
Residential crowding and noise are aspects of housing quality that have been unfavorably associated with children’s development including their motor skills (see Evans 2001 for a review), their persistence on tasks and ability to concentrate (Evans 2001; Evans, Saltzman and Cooperman 2001), as well as their reading ability (Evans and Kantrowitz 2002).
Moreover, housing characteristics may have long-term impacts on children’s outcomes; a two-generation study using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) revealed that living in a clean house was positively associated with respondents’ future educational attainment and earnings (Dunifon, Duncan and Brooks-Gunn 2001).
There is mixed evidence regarding the associations between mental health outcomes and physically inadequate housing (Dunn 2002), although there is some indication that inadequate housing exacerbates psychological distress and other maladaptive behaviors such as behavior problems (see Evans 2001; Evans, Saltzman and Cooperman 2001; Evans, Wells and Moch in press; Newman 2001, for reviews) and psychological distress (Evans 2003).
Children from poor families are more likely than children from middle-income families to experience multiple physical stressors including crowding, noise, and poor housing quality, and these stressors may mediate links between family poverty and children’s socioemotional development (Evans and English 2002).
Boys may be more susceptible to the effects of low-quality housing than girls, and adolescents may be more affected than younger children (Evans, Wells and Moch in press).
In conclusion, there is emerging evidence that residence in low-quality homes has detrimental impacts on children’s well-being.
Housing quality improvement should be a priority of neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation programs, especially since residents may be less likely to make frequent moves if they reside in high-quality homes.
Although it is probably easiest to control housing quality with a project-based approach, the downside is that public housing, regardless of quality, has the potential to “reconcentrate” poor families.
Neighborhood characteristics- in particular neighborhood resources and organizational processes, disorder, and violence- are likely to change following relocation from high- to low-poverty neighborhoods.
It is these changes which may in turn cause neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation efforts to impact children’s and adolescents’ outcomes.
Neighborhood resources encompass the availability, accessibility, and quality of community schools, libraries, recreation centers, and other resources.
Surprisingly, little research has explored variation in community resources by neighborhood SES and the subsequent impacts of these differences on children’s outcomes.
Community child care and schools are important resources that may change following residential moves and may subsequently impact children’s and youths’ outcomes, especially school readiness and achievement.
One study found that the quantity and quality of child care in poor neighborhoods was low, which implies that access to child care may be a benefit of moving out of high-poverty neighborhoods (Fuller et al.
The social and economic make-up of a particular neighborhood is likely intertwined with local schools’ characteristics including quality, climate, and demographics, which has been shown to influence children’s outcomes (see Jencks and Mayer 1990).
The learning activities and centers available within a community (e.
, libraries, literacy programs, family resource centers, museums) are also likely to change following neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation initiatives, as neighborhood disadvantage may be negatively associated with such resources (Catsambis and Beveridge 2001).
When present, organized social and recreational activities including sports programs, art and theater programs, and community centers may foster children’s well-being.
In one study of third graders from middle- and working-class neighborhoods in California, the presence of neighborhood social resources (e.
) was negatively associated with children’s loneliness (O'Neil, Parke and McDowell 2001).
Thus, these types of resources may assuage children’s social transitions into new neighborhoods.
A study of high schoolers found that their self-reported counts of neighborhood resources including community centers, parks and playgrounds, transportation, job opportunities, health clinics, and counseling/social services were positively associated with the youths’ intention to complete high school (Williams et al.
Contrary to expectations, one study found that family participation in recreation or sports programs was lowest for residents in moderately poor neighborhoods and highest for families residing in high-poverty neighborhoods (Rankin and Quane 2000), which has implications for the economic make-up of neighborhoods targeted by deconcentration and/or desegregation programs.
The quantity of health-related services in a community is generally excluded from studies of child health, although evidence exists that access to certain types of medical facilities (e.
, emergency care versus primary care) may vary depending upon neighborhood SES (Brooks-Gunn et al.
A recent study found that access to mental health services was actually higher in urban than suburban areas (Allard, Tolman and Rosen 2003).
Families’ access to health clinics has clear links to their subsequent health outcomes and may be altered following neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation efforts.
The following part of this section reviews research on neighborhood organization including collective efficacy or informal social control (e.
, mutual trust and willingness to intervene for the common good) on children’s outcomes, notably, behavior problems and delinquency.
The presence or absence of neighborhood organization, disorder, and violence is indicative of a neighborhood’s ethos; i.
, the shared values and trust among neighborhood residents (Sampson, Morenoff and Earls 1999; Sampson, Raudenbush and Earls 1997).
Data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN), a neighborhood-based study of 80 Chicago neighborhoods, found that neighborhood disadvantage, residential instability, immigrant concentration, observed neighborhood disorder, and crime and victimization were negatively associated with neighborhood collective efficacy and social control (Sampson 1997; Sampson, Morenoff and Earls 1999; Sampson, Raudenbush and Earls 1997).
Other studies have found that the presence of collective efficacy and social control in neighborhoods were positively associated with youths’ achievement (Ainsworth 2002), and negatively associated with children’s problematic behaviors (Elliott et al.
1996; Gorman-Smith, Tolan and Henry 2000; Kowaleski-Jones 2000; O'Neil, Parke and McDowell 2001), indicating the importance of these neighborhood mechanisms for children’s well-being.
The absence of community formal and informal institutions to regulate residents’ behavior is thought to be associated with pervasiveness of risk to residents (e.
, danger, violence, crime, and access to illegal or harmful substances), which impedes children’s well-being and development.
In fact, a Canadian study found strong negative associations between neighborhood disorder (e.
, persons arguing, shouting, or fighting in a hostile or threatening manner, as observed by interviewers) and preschool aged children’s verbal ability after controlling for family and neighborhood SES as well as maternal mental health (Kohen et al.
Moreover, low-income children growing up in poor neighborhoods are exposed to high levels of violence within their communities and homes beginning in their early years (Buka et al.
2001; Martinez and Richters 1993; Richters and Martinez 1993), which is subsequently linked to adverse mental health outcomes with potentially long-term effects such as behavior problems, depression, anxiety, oppositional and conduct disorders, alcohol use, and school-related problems (Aneshensel and Sucoff 1996; Buka et al.
2001; Fitzpatrick 1993; Gorman-Smith and Tolan 1998; Margolin and Gordis 2000; Osofsky 1999; Schwab-Stone et al.
In conclusion, this section highlighted potential neighborhood-based characteristics that impact children’s and youths’ outcomes.
Neighborhood resources including child care and schools, learning and recreational centers, and activities may vary according to neighborhood SES and thus, children’s access to them may be altered through neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation initiatives.
Furthermore, neighborhoods create and sustain their own set of organizational norms, rules, and regulations that are enforced both formally and informally.
Past research has shown that impoverished neighborhoods have fewer of these characteristics in place, resulting in higher incidences of disorder, delinquency, and violence compared with more affluent neighborhoods.
In terms of direct linkages between neighborhood and housing policies and children’s well-being, it appears that placing children in more affluent neighborhood environments should facilitate their school readiness skills and lead to more favorable achievement outcomes most likely due to improved school quality, better resources, and greater achievement orientation in affluent neighborhoods.
At the same time, removing children from disadvantaged neighborhoods is likely to lessen children’s behavior and emotional problems due to lower access to delinquent peers and communal acceptance of such behavior.
For the hypothetical impacts of neighborhood resources to occur, it is necessary for children attending low-quality schools to begin attending higher-quality schools and for children with deviant peers to begin associating with non-deviant peers following residential moves.
The distance families move as well as the school assignment policy certainly impact the degree of neighborhood change children and youth experience.
Parental economic resources, well-being, and relationships with their children are a central conduit between neighborhood effects and children’s and adolescents’ outcomes.
Neighborhood SES and residential segregation are thought to influence a variety of parental characteristics such as their economic resources and access to employment, mental and physical health, and parents’ behavior.
Aside from the experimental evidence discussed in a previous section, there is little research documenting neighborhood effects on adults’ economic well-being.
Two studies have documented positive associations between neighborhood poverty concentration and unemployment and welfare dependence (Devine et al.
2002; Reingold, Van Ryzin and Ronda 2001).
Furthermore, another study found that the neighborhood unemployment rate and percentage of families receiving welfare was negatively associated with adults’ self-efficacy scores (Boardman and Robert 2000), thus indicating the potential benefits of improved economic circumstances on adults’ well-being.
The association between neighborhood structural conditions, notably SES and percentage minority, and adults’ physical and mental health has been replicated within a number of studies (e.
2001; Cubbin, LeClere and Smith 2000; Diez Roux et al.
2001; Ellen, Mijanovich and Dillman 2001; Goldsmith, Holzer and Manderscheid 1998; Kahlmeier et al.
2001; Malmstrom, Johansson and Sundquist 2001; Ross 2000; Ross and Mirowsky 2001; Williams and Collins 2001).
Mentally and physically healthy parents (relative to unhealthy parents) are better able to interact with their children and act in a supportive manner, which facilitates children’s positive development (Jackson et al.
One study of first grade children and their parents found that the positive association between neighborhood risk and children’ externalizing problems was partially mediated by maternal depression (Greenberg et al.
A study by Elder and colleagues (1995) found that among Black families, the link between neighborhood disadvantage and family monitoring and supervision was mediated by levels of parental self-efficacy.
Finally, maternal well-being moderated the positive association between neighborhood drop-out rate and youths’ risk-taking behaviors such that the association was strongest among youth whose mothers exhibited low self-esteem scores (Kowaleski-Jones 2000).
Neighborhood conditions, notably poverty and danger, may affect specific parental behaviors including warmth, harshness, and supervision.
Studies have found that residence in poor, dangerous neighborhoods was associated with lower maternal warmth (Klebanov, Brooks-Gunn and Duncan 1994; Pinderhughes et al.
2001) and higher rates of harsh control, verbal aggression, and inconsistent discipline from mothers (Earls, McGuire and Shay 1994; Hill and Herman-Stahl 2002; Molnar et al.
In terms of linkages with children’s and adolescents’ outcomes, Simons and his colleagues (1996) found that the effect of community disadvantage on adolescent boys’ externalizing and internalizing behavior problems was mediated by quality of parenting (i.
, warmth, harshness, hostility, and communication).
Additionally, nurturing, supportive parenting may help to buffer children from some of the negative consequences of growing up in a disadvantaged neighborhood including associations with deviant peers (Brody et al.
2002) and exposure to violence (O'Donnell, Schwab-Stone and Muyeed 2002).
High levels of parental supervision and monitoring may be related to neighborhood poverty and danger and could serve to insulate children from harmful community influences, which may then promote children’s and adolescents’ well-being.
In one study, maternal involvement served as a protective factor against association with delinquent peers among 10- to 12-year old children residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods (Brody et al.
A Seattle area study of young adolescents found that maternal control buffered the negative association between neighborhood risk and youths’ grade point average (Gonzales et al.
Similarly, two studies of Black families residing in Chicago reported positive impacts of parental monitoring on 11- to 16-year old teens’ social skills, behavior, and grades, especially in neighborhoods rated high on assessments of social cohesion and social control (Quane and Rankin 1998; Rankin and Quane 2002).
Moving impacts the entire family.
Parents’ economic resources, mental health, and subsequent parenting skills directly affect their children and these behaviors may depend on the type of neighborhoods families reside in.
Thus, children are likely to be indirectly affected by neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation programs through impacts on their parents.
Safe communities where children can play outside free of harm are likely to foster different parenting techniques than dangerous communities where children may be most safe at home.
Moving, following the implementation of neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation initiatives, likely alters families’ social climates, as preexisting social ties may be disrupted or broken and discrimination may be present in receiving communities.
More affluent neighborhoods, however, may offer ready access to informal social networks that serve as sources of information and opportunity for residents.
Thus, the presence or absence of social networks and ties may mediate the efficacy of neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation initiatives on children’s outcomes.
Granovetter (1973) notes the importance of so-called “weak ties,” acquaintance-like relationships that serve as portals of information, opportunity, and resources (see also Briggs 1998; Wellman and Wortley 1990).
Neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation efforts where families move to more affluent neighborhoods are a mechanism for making such socially distant ties accessible for low-income children and adults.
A review of the role of weak ties for Black children attending integrated schools, which is a corollary to neighborhood integration efforts, noted that, in general, desegregated Black students formulated higher and more realistic future aspirations than their segregated counterparts (Wells and Crain 1994).
Furthermore, another study found a positive association between white collar neighbors and the likelihood of adolescents’ high school graduation (Crane 1991).
Thus, if social supports including weak ties are important to parents and children alike and are more readily available in middle-income or affluent neighborhoods, it is important to consider how such networks are built when low-income, minority residents relocate.
Contact theory (Allport 1954; Pettigrew 1998), popularized in the middle of the last century as a way of facilitating better race relations in the U.
, postulated that simple contact between members of different cultural or ethnic groups may facilitate positive intergroup attitude changes and interaction patterns.
More specifically, the original theory suggested that intergroup cooperation could result if contact is frequent, systematic, and made in an amicable environment in pursuit of a common goal.
A number of studies focusing on both adults and children have explored aspects of contact theory.
Among adults, an older study found that White women’s previous interracial contact and current interracial neighbor contact were associated with lower levels of prejudice (Ford 1973).
Interethnic contact may mediate the association between parental opposition to integration and children’s changes in racial attitudes, highlighting the importance of contact between groups for effective change (Miller 1990).
White children may be less accommodating than their Black peers when a person of a different race lives in their neighborhood.
One study found that this was especially true with adolescents (versus children) and that early school desegregation efforts assuaged White children’s negative racial attitudes (Scott and McPartland 1982).
Studies using elementary school-aged children (Stephan and Rosenfield, 1978), high schoolers (Moody 2001), and college students (Duncan et al.
2003) reported positive associations between interethnic social contact (e.
, play dates, extracurricular activities) and parents’ and children’s attitudes regarding integration and affirmative action as well as the diversity of their social groups.
However, there needs to be a balance between racial/ethnic groups for this to occur.
One study revealed that minority students attending a primarily White school (e.
, less than 10 percent minority) were more likely to associate with own-race peers than minority children attending a school with 30 percent or more minority children (Quillian and Campbell 2003).
Another study reported that attending an integrated school and/or living in a diverse neighborhood as a child was associated with the ethnic make-up of adult social ties including friendships, spouses, and church congregations; these findings were robust regardless of the respondents’ race/ethnicity (Emerson, Kimbro and Yancey 2002).
In conclusion, social ties and networks are an important resource for low-income families residing in both poor and middle-income neighborhoods.
While relocation due to neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation initiatives likely disrupts families’ social systems, the presence of more advantaged neighbors in the new communities may benefit incoming families.
For effective relationships to develop between current and new residents, contact needs to occur, and research has shown that contact occurring within a supportive environment does indeed facilitate more positive relations between different groups.
The problems that remains, then, is that there may be little opportunity for new, low-income residents to engage in positive encounters with current residents.
More work is needed that examines programs and initiatives that foster positive relationships among economically and ethnically diverse residents.
The large body of work on cumulative contextual risk including family poverty, residential moves, household head marital status, parental mental health, and child maltreatment, among other factors, revealed that the amalgam of risk factors is often more harmful than the impacts of each independently (Ackerman et al.
1999a; Atzaba-Poria, Pike and Deater-Deckard 2004; Brooks-Gunn et al.
1995; Evans 2003; Prelow and Loukas 2003).
Paralleling this work, when children relocate out of impoverished neighborhoods to low-poverty neighborhoods, it is necessary to examine all of the corresponding factors that concurrently change.
Consideration of variation within and between pathways helps to make sense of how neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation efforts may differentially affect children and youth.
For example, while we might suspect that living in high-quality housing is favorably associated with children’s outcomes (particularly cognitive outcomes), potential benefits may be attenuated if the construction of new low-cost housing keeps poor families concentrated, albeit in higher quality housing.
Or, if a family relocates to high-quality housing, but the children do not change schools as a result of the move and remain in low-quality schools, the potential positive impact of improved housing quality may be suppressed.
(See Table 3 for a summary of the pathways.
) Similarly, the potential discrimination that low-income, minority families may face in their new neighborhoods could override any other potential benefits in the way of improved housing quality, neighborhood characteristics, and family dynamics.
Moreover, the impacts of the pathways may vary depending on the attributes of the child (e.
, age, sex) or the outcome variable being assessed.
For example, we might expect parental attributes to impact younger children more than their adolescent siblings, as the family environment is likely to be more salient for younger than older children, due to the limited independence of the former.
Neighborhood organization is likely to primarily affect adolescent boys’ behavior problems and delinquency because of the strong association between neighborhood disorder and delinquency among this group.
Housing quality and neighborhood resources probably influence children’s cognitive and achievement outcomes more so than their behavior and emotional outcomes.
In sum, there are many factors that come into play and affect children’s adjustment to neighborhood poverty deconcentration programs.
Summary of Pathways of Neighborhood Poverty Deconcentration Programs on on Childrens' and Adolescents' Well-Being Each of the four potential pathways highlights ways in which moving from an impoverished neighborhood to a low-poverty or middle-class neighborhood may benefit children and their families.
Research has shown connections between poor housing quality and children’s health and behavior.
Thus, if policies are created to assist low-income families with their housing needs, restrictions against movement into low-quality housing should be implemented.
Community resources including schools, recreational facilities, and access to employment as well as neighborhood organization, disorder, and violence can certainly serve to either protect or inhibit children’s development.
For example, moving to neighborhoods where violence and drug use is sanctioned may lead to declines in adolescents’ engagement in similar activities.
Neighborhood environments impact the entire family, not just children.
Thus, it is important to examine the ways in which primary caregivers’ physical and mental health as well as their parenting is influenced by different environments as a way of better understanding how children and youth may be indirectly affected by their neighborhoods and changes in these environments.
Finally, neighborhood social climate, including access to social supports and ties, has a potential influence on children and their parents and thus such networks should be facilitated following neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation initiatives.
With all of the changes in federal cash assistance policy since the late 1990s (i.
, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), other forms of government aid have become crucial in order to maintain the subsistence of low-income families.
In particular, housing may cost low-income families more than half of their earned incomes, creating an unnecessary cost burden for families relying on meager salaries or welfare benefits.
Consequently, without housing assistance, poor families’ housing choices are likely to be constrained to the most impoverished neighborhoods where public housing and low-rent apartments are prevalent, creating pockets of concentrated poverty.
The fact that minority families are more likely to be poor than Whites makes it more likely that these impoverished neighborhoods are primarily inhabited by Black and Latino families.
The first section of this paper reviewed extant literature to this effect.
Following that section was information on neighborhood poverty deconcentration and/or racial desegregation techniques used in recent years, focusing on new trends in project-based assistance and housing vouchers.
These sections segued into a review of three prominent housing mobility programs, namely the Gautreaux Program in Chicago, the Yonkers (New York) Project, and the Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing Demonstration in five U.
Each of the three deconcentration and/or desegregation programs utilized moving as the instrument for mitigating neighborhood poverty.
However, the programs’ aims (e.
, deconcentration versus desegregation) differed as well as the ways in which mobility was brokered for families (e.
, vouchers versus public housing).
Subsequent sections reviewed relevant research from two separate bodies of literature, namely school desegregation and residential mobility, in order to supplement the limited extant research examining the efficacy of neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation programs.
Various mechanisms or pathways of influence were reviewed, namely, housing quality, community resources and characteristics, parenting and family processes, and the neighborhood social climate.
These four potential pathways emphasize the intricacies of neighborhood effects on children’s and adolescents’ outcomes as well as the infinite considerations policymakers must contend with as they design policies that attempt to alleviate neighborhood poverty concentration.
The appropriate timing of such initiatives in the lives of children is crucial.
Theoretically, we might expect the largest “neighborhood effects” during the adolescent years as these types of influences are expected to take precedence as children segue into adolescents (Aber et al.
1997; Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn 2000).
However, the work on family poverty indicates that early, persistent poverty may be most deleterious for children in the short- and long-term compared with later or intermittent poverty (Duncan et al.
1998; Korenman, Miller and Sjaastad 1995; McLeod and Edwards 1995), which indicates that for neighborhood deconcentration programs to be most effective, they should occur early in children’s lives.
In fact, the increases in property crime among experimental MTO boys and in behavior problems and delinquency among youth in the Yonkers Project (both relative to in-place controls) were strongest for older adolescents— children that spent much of their childhood in concentrated poverty.
A recent study found that associations between neighborhood poverty and young adults’ behavior problems were strongest when neighborhood poverty was assessed during middle childhood compared with adolescence (Wheaton and Clarke 2003).
We might suspect that the opposite would also be true— strong positive associations between early neighborhood affluence and young adults’ mental health.
The work on school desegregation supports this early implementation perspective as the impacts of such school initiatives were strongest among children attending desegregated elementary schools relative to desegregated high schools.
The work on residential mobility complicates the early timing hypothesis presented above as moving during the early childhood years was more deleterious for children than moving later in life.
Additionally, family disadvantage accentuated unfavorable impacts of residential mobility on children.
It may be that some of the early negative impacts on children who participated in the neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation programs summarized earlier were due to this accumulation of stressors.
On the positive side, parental support, which is a potential benefit of neighborhood poverty deconcentration efforts, appeared to mitigate the negative impacts of residential mobility on children’s outcomes, which may bode well for children in the long-term.
Also, there is some evidence to suggest that upwardly mobile moves are generally beneficial for families, although the circumstances surrounding the moves made by families who participate in neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation programs are unique compared to most “upward” moves (e.
Probably the most crucial consideration when determining the relative merits of neighborhood poverty deconcentration initiatives is the potential for discrimination.
The deleterious impacts of discrimination may override the benefits of improved housing quality, resources, neighborhood organization, and the like.
The situation in Yonkers is most revealing of this phenomenon as the 1985 court order was vociferously and adamantly contested by middle-class, White residents (Belkin 1999; Newman 1996).
Relatedly, empirical studies have shown that a mismatch between family- and neighborhood-SES was unfavorably associated with outcomes for children (Gordon et al.
Along the same lines, other work has shown that the benefits of residing in an advantaged neighborhood diminished at very high levels of neighborhood SES (Turley 2003).
Thus, when creating new housing policies, the climate of the low-poverty neighborhoods needs to be considered.
Encouraging low-income, minority families to relocate to low-poverty, ethnically diverse neighborhoods rather than affluent, White neighborhoods may be the best option.
It is important to return to the findings from the three key studies of residential mobility programs.
Each of the studies found generally positive impacts on participating adults, and findings from the Gautreaux Program revealed that children that moved to the suburbs were more likely to later attend college and be employed compared with their peers who remained in high-poverty neighborhoods.
These findings point to the importance of the long-term effects of such programs, which parallels the school desegregation literature.
When assessing the efficacy of residential mobility programs, we need not be hasty and expect immediate results for children.
Beyond understanding the range of factors that come together to affect children’s well-being in the face of neighborhood deconcentration and/or desegregation programs, policymakers must also consider the feasibility of various policy approaches.
Housing support for low-income families needs to be supplemented with counseling and longer-term support services.
Only one in four families eligible for housing assistance receive it from the government (Center for Budget and Policy Priorities 2003).
Furthermore, there have been repeated problems with the “portability” of vouchers, or the ability of families to apply their vouchers in communities different from where they were originally issued (Goetz 2003).
Once families receive vouchers, they should receive immediate assistance in navigating the rental market including finding affordable, high-quality apartments with nearby access to necessary services.
Housing authorities should encourage (and assist, as needed) families to relocate to economically and racially integrated neighborhoods with an appropriate balance between middle-class and poor, and White and minority residents so positive outcomes are maximized for all groups (Galster 2002).
Assistance should not cease once a family signs a lease, especially if they relocate into an economically and ethnically mixed neighborhood.
In line with contact theory, community-based social groups and committees should be created to facilitate cooperation, trust, and eventually, friendships among new and old residents.
While many of the policies or strategies presented in this paper have been rental-based techniques, home ownership should not be overlooked, especially for lower-income families at the higher end of the income range.
Home ownership is a defense against frequent residential mobility, which can be detrimental to children’s well-being.
Further, recent reviews indicate that homeowners tend to maintain their dwellings at a higher standard than do renters, which has implications for housing quality.
Additionally, they may learn important self-sufficiency skills (e.
, learning how to perform repairs, negotiate with contractors, etc.
) that may benefit children exposed to such behaviors.
Home owners may be more invested in their neighborhoods and become more concerned with threats to property values such as delinquency and disorder (Galster in press; Schill and Wachter 2001).
Homeownership is often a sound investment that serves to improve families’ equity.
Yet, many minority families may be thwarted from becoming home owners due to lack of access to available housing and financing options, higher moving costs, and racial/ethnic steering, wherein minority families are encouraged to buy in primarily Black or Hispanic areas (see Zubrinsky Charles 2003).
In light of the severe rent burden borne by lower-income families, progressive tax policies including the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) utilized in conjunction with housing vouchers may help to alleviate poverty in the U.
Eligible families are more likely to receive EITC benefits than housing vouchers, indicating the EITC is a more accessible form of assistance (Stegman, Davis and Quercia 2003).
At its current levels, the EITC reduces severe housing-cost burden for 15 percent of EITC-eligible families with children.
Clearly, there is room for greater EITC benefits and participation among families needing increased housing assistance.
Housing policies are often overlooked one of the best mechanisms to lift families out of poverty, as more than 5 million Americans, with incomes up to three times the minimum wage, pay more than 50 percent of their incomes or housing (Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University 2003).
Concentrated poverty is harmful to children, but the solution does not necessarily lie in moving low-income families to middle-class neighborhoods without further assistance.
Moreover, simply providing families with vouchers to move without overseeing their placement may lead to frequent intra-community mobility within impoverished neighborhoods.
The larger goal of such policies should be to break the cycle of economic and racial inequality present in the U.
More long-term evidence is needed to see how families who participated in the three key residential mobility programs fare over time.
This research should be supplemented with in-depth, qualitative interviews with families to better understand their specific experiences as pioneers in these low-poverty neighborhoods.
The more we learn about the intricate associations between poverty and children’s well-being, the better we can appropriately design and implement interventions.

Minority families may actually prefer racially and economically mixed neighborhoods, so called “50-50” neighborhoods, or may fear discrimination and thus turn away from residing in middle-class, primarily White communities (Clark 1991; Krysan and Farley 2002; Wilson and Hammer 2001).
Although not the focus of the present discussion, so-called “development strategies” take an entirely different approach to providing opportunity for low-income families residing in impoverished areas, by instating policies to return jobs to central cities (Hughes 1995).
A tertiary issue worth mentioning is that of program take-up.
Due to the relatively low percentage of selected families that actually chose to move in the Gautreaux and MTO programs (20 percent and 47-60 percent, respectively), the samples may not be entirely representative of public housing residents.
Although families were compared on a number of baseline characteristics based on treatment or program status, there may be unmeasured variables for which families that chose to move differ from families that forfeited their placement.
In the Yonkers project, however, only 11 families selected to participate opted not to move; these families were similar in terms of background and demographic characteristics to the families that moved.
Thus, unlike Yonkers, it could be argued that Gautreaux and MTO families who participated in the programs are a select group of public housing residents, a potentially more advantaged, “creamed” subsample of the population.

The first study, commenced in 1982, had two waves, a three-year study and a ten-year follow-up (years of studies are based on averages) focusing on 114 mothers and one randomly selected child between the ages of 6- to 16-years who had attended both inner-city and suburban schools.
Although 61 of the children actually participated, most of the child data were based on maternal-report.
As a comparison group, 48 city movers were recruited.
In 1989, an average of ten years following original moves, a follow-up study was conducted with 58 percent (n = 107) of the original families (n = 68 suburban movers, n = 39 city movers).
Due to the small subsample of city movers, an additional ten similar city families were recruited.
Seventy-eight percent of suburban movers remained in the suburbs at the time of the follow-up.
The second study, which began in 1988, approximately six years after selected respondents originally moved, was based on a random sample of 342 participating families (n = 230 suburban movers, n = 112 city movers) and focused primarily on adults’ economic outcomes; 67 percent of families selected participated.
In-depth interviews were conducted with 95 (n = 52 suburban movers, n = 43 city movers) respondents in their homes.
In both studies, the two groups (suburban and city movers) were similar on a number of relevant background characteristics including maternal education, household composition, and child age and gender.
Additionally, suburban movers resided at their current address slightly longer than city movers (Rosenbaum 1995; Rubinowitz and Rosenbaum 2000).
In general, suburban movers originally relocated to primarily middle-class, White neighborhoods and the city movers selected for the studies relocated to neighborhoods not unlike those from which they came.
Families in both the three-year and six-year studies were interviewed in their homes by Black women.
Interviews focused on residents’ perceptions of and their experiences in their new neighborhoods including harassment and discrimination, as well as questions on children’s education.
Results were obtained from qualitative records, descriptive statistics, and regression analyses controlling for a standard set of background characteristics (Rosenbaum et al.
Two hundred families in public housing and on the wait list for public housing residing in Southwest Yonkers were selected via lottery to move to the new public housing (“movers”); 189 families relocated.
The 11 families selected who opted not to move did not significantly differ from the families who moved within the program on any major demographic characteristics.
The analytic sample consisted of 173 mover families, excluding White participants (n = 16), since they were not the target of the court order.
An in-place control group of demographically similar residents who remained in Southwest Yonkers (“stayers”) was recruited via network sampling, in which movers were asked to name a maximum of five demographically similar families currently residing in Southwest Yonkers who had expressed interest in relocating.
Secondly, families that had been on the public housing wait list who replaced mover families in the old public housing units were also recruited.
All but 36 of the 402 families recruited using the two strategies were screened to determine their public housing eligibility according to the Yonkers Housing Authority’s guidelines.
Forty percent (n = 148) of the 366 families that completed the screener interview would have been eligible for the housing lottery had they applied; three-quarters were public housing residents.
All but three of these families were interviewed.
Nearly half (46 percent, n = 66; “lottery losers”) of the eligible, participating families had, in fact, entered the lottery and lost, and the remaining 54 percent (n = 79; “other stayers”) of the participants who met the criteria elicited through the screening process never applied to the housing lottery regardless of their eligibility.
Thus, approximately half of the control group is randomized (“lottery losers”).
Univariate comparisons between movers and the two stayer subsamples revealed that the “other stayers” were somewhat more disadvantaged than the randomized groups (“movers” and “lottery losers”).
The final stayer sample consists of 142 residents of Southwest Yonkers, omitting the three non-minority families from analyses.
Of the 315 families (n = 173 movers and n = 142 stayers) included in the analytic sample, 261 8- to 18-year old youth (n = 147 movers and n = 114 stayers) from 167 of the 315 families (83 percent of families with eligible youth, 53 percent of total families interviewed) completed interviews.
Movers and stayers were fairly similar in terms of background demographic characteristics.
The Yonkers (NY) Project commenced between 1994 and 1995, approximately two years (M = 22.
75 months to 36 months) after mover families relocated.
Structured interviews focusing on a range of outcomes, which took approximately two hours, were administered to families by trained graduate students within participants’ homes.
Multiple regression analyses controlling for background and demographic characteristics were utilized to assess differences between movers and stayers on relevant outcomes.
This paper reviewed short-term (approximately three-year) impact evaluations for three of the MTO project sites, namely Baltimore, Boston, and New York City.
First, the Baltimore MTO follow-up study utilized city administrative data and state standardized achievement test scores to examine educational outcomes from over 1,200 primarily Black and Latino children between the ages of 5 and 12 years from 638 families (Ludwig, Ladd and Duncan 2001).
An additional study, smaller in scope, was conducted with 336 adolescents who were 11 to 16 years of age when their families were randomly assigned MTO placement, and examined prevalence of crime and delinquency among teenagers from the three treatment groups using juvenile arrest records (Ludwig, Duncan and Hirschfield 2001).
The Boston study focused on 612 6- to 15-year old children from 540 participating families using administrative school data and telephone interviews conducted with primary caregivers (Katz, Kling and Liebman 2001).
Finally, data from the New York City evaluation, which used data from in-home interviews with primary caregivers and up to two children under the age of 18 years, spawned two studies; the first focused on 512 Black and Latino children aged 8 to 18 years (Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn 2003) and the second examined 588 Black and Latino 6- to 16-year olds (Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn in press).
Each of the studies listed above utilized instrumental variable analyses and multiple regression analyses to determine treatment effects.
The interim evaluation, which took place approximately six years following the implementation of the demonstration included approximately 4,300 families from the five U.
cities that participated in the original random assignment process (92 percent of the full MTO sample).
Up to two randomly selected 5- to 19-year old children from each household were also recruited for this evaluation, which focused on outcomes including economic factors, adult and child physical and mental health and delinquency, and children’s educational achievement.
A YOUNG GIRL, a primary grade-schooler with a well-worn library card, was enthusiastically reading a riveting memoir when a stern tone descended upon her.
Such works, the girl was told, were unacceptable for classroom “reading time,” let alone for a book report.
The teacher’s sharp ruling boiled down to a four-word excuse for banishment: Here we go again.
Two decades after Art Spiegelman’s landmark Holocaust graphic novel “Maus” won the Pulitzer Prize and helped stake a fresh claim for comics as literature — paving the way for the appreciation of such works as “Persepolis” and “Blankets” and “American Born Chinese” — do a significant number of teachers and administrators remain mired in such backward thinking.
Unfortunately, my rhetoric is rhetorical.
These curricular “world-is-flat’ers” are still thick on our school grounds.
But it’s time for the culture’s tectonic plates to more rapidly force a shift in academic thought.
As we step into 2014, this lingering bias in curriculum needs to cease.
We fervently urge the least enlightened of our educators to catch up with the rest of the class.
And to make our case, let us present Exhibit A: The young girl who faced that rebuke of illustrated books was a relative of mine.
And that book (a-hem) in question was “Stitches: A Memoir,” acclaimed author David Small’s poignant personal story of a dysfunctional childhood home — including his adolescent battle with throat cancer, which may have been caused by his doctor-father’s early over-embrace of X-ray radiation.
In Small’s masterful prose and liquid pictures, we vividly experience the voiceless boy-patient’s raw emotions.
Even four years ago, quite a few people would have begged to differ with that grade-school teacher.
“Stitches” climbed the bestseller list of the New York Times, which deemed the book worthy of review; was named one of the best books of the year by such outlets as Publishers Weekly; and was a finalist for the 2009 National Book Award for Young People’s Literature.
No less than Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist/author/playwright/screenwriter Jules Feiffer said aptly of Small’s masterpiece: “It left me speechless.
” Of the teacher’s wrong-headed thinking, I was left speechless.
Her decision was not a mere judgment against one book, but an ignorant indictment of all graphic novels.
As blanket criticism, it was unabashedly threadbare.
Consider my commentary here, then, to be a criticism of that criticism.
Because what the larger academic problem calls for is not damnation, but persuasion.
Into Plato’s cave, let us bring truer illumination.
What follows is not some broad indictment of modern American education.
I was born into a brood of teachers — the family crest might as well be a chalkboard — and I deeply value what too often is one of the nation’s more thankless and underpaid cornerstone careers.
Plus, as an artist who has spoken to thousands of impressive educators — many of whom appreciated my history-themed syndicated comic strip — I applaud those who thoughtfully and passionately help inform and shape young minds, while keeping an open mind themselves.
On this front, so many of them “get” it.
What this essay is, at heart, is an extended hand in the name of better understanding — especially as our schools are filled with so-called “reluctant readers” and other struggling learners.
We face an educational imperative: Why not use every effective teaching tool at our disposal.
Decades of studies have shown the power of visual learning as an effective scholastic technique.
Author Neil Gaiman (winner of the Newbery and Carnegie medals for children’s lit) recently noted that comics were once falsely accused of fostering illiteracy.
We now know that comics — the marriage of word and picture in a dynamic relationship that fires synapses across the brain — can be a bridge to literacy and a path to learning.
Armed with that knowledge, the last thing we need blocking that footbridge is the Reluctant Teacher.
Fortunately, 2013 rises to aid our cause.
It was a banner year for graphic novels; top authors ranged from a young hip-hop fan to a heroic septuagenarian congressman writing his first comic — and in between were a couple of world-class cartoonists who also happen to be widely recognized educators.
Great works help beget great change.
So here, then, is our examination of 10 stellar graphic novels and illustrated books from the year past (all equally fit for adult consumption, to boot).
Because the writing is on the classroom wall.
As generations are weaned on the Internet, our culture grows ever more visual.
And the take-home lesson is this: Let us meet our young minds where they live.
Let us smartly employ the resources of visual learning.
IT WAS DALIA ZIADA’s first act of nonviolent protest.
The young Egyptian woman had come upon a true-life action hero in a half-century-old American comic book, and had absorbed its lessons of “passive activism.
” Right after reading it, Ziada determined she would put these teachings into real-world practice.
That night, she would stop a female circumcision.
Ziada had been circumcised prior to puberty, and now, within hours, her 8-year-old niece was due for the same procedure.
Emboldened by the book, Dalia applied verbal pressure upon her uncle and explained why there would be no genital mutilation in the morning.
No hands were raised, no fists were thrown.
Ziada won her showdown, and was set on a path to professional nonviolent protest.
In 2011, Ziada, then age 29, stood among the Tahrir Square demonstrators in her Cairo hometown during Arab Spring.
She told me that she and her group, the American Islamic Congress, translated and disseminated thousands of Arabic-language issues of the same American comic book that inspired her five years earlier, and that its narrative had inspired some young Egyptians to protest peacefully.
As igniter of young minds, its story sparked like flint rock.
The book was “Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story,” a brightly tinted comic published by Fellowship of the Reconciliation in the mid-’50s, as the American civil-rights movement was gathering force.
The story spotlighted not only Dr.
King but also such fellow icons of nonviolent protest as Rosa Parks and Gandhi.
Today, an Arabic edition of that same book hangs in the Hill office of Rep.
The framed copy symbolizes just how much social power this one comic still holds more than five decades after the congressman discovered it.
The physical book is mere pulp, penwork and printing, but the content of its characters, and their messages, is indelible.
Lewis grew up poor, preaching to the chickens on a Southern sharecropper’s farm, but he had access to newspaper comics as an affordable form of entertainment and enlightenment.
By the time he was a teenager — well-versed in comics’ unique language — he was prepared to appreciate a strong comic book, and “The Montgomery Story” struck him like a call to action.
Young John Lewis’s journey as an organizer of nonviolent protests led him to meet Dr.
King while a college student in the ‘50s; delivered him to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963, as the youngest speaker (at 23) at the March on Washington; and compelled him two years later to stand shoulder to shoulder with marchers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge near Selma, Ala.
, where he was beaten by troopers till he thought he was going to die.
The nonviolent protestors on that day in 1965 were bloodied but unbowed.
Later that year, President Lyndon B.
Johnson would feel compelled to sign the Voting Rights Act.
Today, at 73, Lewis himself sits in Washington, striding the halls of power and enshrined as a civil-rights icon.
When I talk with him, he seemingly remembers everything from along his long journey, and he certainly hasn’t forgot his sense of the social force fostered by a comic bearing a clear, moral message.
And so, when the moment arrived, he was poised to provide his own literary contribution.
Several years ago, a young Lewis aide named Andrew Aydin was teased by fellow staffers for his passionate comics fandom.
Lewis, however, quieted the in-house critics by sharing how his long career as a protestor had been spawned by a single comic book.
Moved by this news, Aydin told his boss he should write his memoir as a graphic novel; Lewis agreed — he saw a way to reach a new generation — but would proceed only if Aydin would co-write this sweeping story.
This past summer, just days before the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, Lewis and Aydin — working with acclaimed artist Nate Powell — took the first published step in their trek, releasing “March: Book One” (Top Shelf), a stirring, 121-page tale of Lewis’s early years that kicks off a planned trilogy.
Like so much about Lewis’s life, the work is a milestone — a landmark that belongs in every school library and every classroom; it will reach and teach the struggle for equality in a way few other books since “The Montgomery Story” can.
For twin reasons, the best-selling “March” is to be especially celebrated.
The first is because the writers and the artist — through compelling vividness of line and speech — place us intensely in each setting.
Elegant panels, rendered in black-and-white with rich gray washes, ripple with depth of both field and dialogue.
The images and verbal exchanges envelop us; it is being present in the past as immersive experience.
And what better way to teach history than as a living and breathing thing.
“March” opens with Lewis and his fellow demonstrators gathering on the Pettus Bridge, as authorities wielding batons and teargas turn the nonviolent protest violent.
Lewis was prepared to lay down his life in his fight for rights, and he nearly did as he was hauled to jail.
The congressman recalls those wounds so freshly, those emotions so palpably, that he brought his new creative collaborators to this very bridge to summon the memories.
Lewis wanted Powell, a young Southern artist, to see the lay of the land as a tangible path toward flashback.
If graphic-novel readers were going to feel this pivotal day — virtually experience it physically and psychologically — Aydin and Powell would need to sense it so they could communicate it.
“March” conveys crucial history so powerfully that I would hold this memoir before my young relative’s teacher, ask her to read it — and then dare her to tell me it’s not a “book,” let alone one whose lessons will outlive us both.
Then again, I can’t overly fault a sole teacher’s perception when nearby, nearly 60 years ago, Washington itself began loudly decrying the American comic book.
The irony is not lost on Lewis that back when he was a teen, it was Congress itself that wrongly tarnished the popular perception of comics in the United States — and in doing so, decimated much of the field for decades.
In 1954, a Senate subcommittee bought into the faulty science of psychiatrist Fredric Wertham, whose book “Seduction of the Innocent” — with his since-discredited “studies” linking comics and juvenile delinquency — stoked a McCarthy-era hysteria against the books, and led to a highly restrictive Comics Code of ethics that creatively crippled the industry.
With some exceptions, comic books — so hugely popular during their World War II infancy — were now commonly viewed at worst as a threat to our children, and at best as pure pop-culture trash.
In recent years of the long recovery, how far we’ve finally come.
With each eminent work like “March,” more institutional anti-comics obstacles fall.
But as Lewis knows well, ignorant biases die hard.
The twist in all this is that Lewis has yet again become a pioneer: He is the first sitting member of Congress to publish a graphic novel.
And in December, he and his publisher provided a free digital issue of “March” to every politician in the Senate and House — and even bundled each copy with another book worthy of Congress’s intellectual attention: “Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story” — the comic that has ignited minds from Alabama to Egypt.
At last, two great graphic novels sit in prominence in the nation’s House.
If only they were deemed worthy of enriching the country’s every schoolhouse.
THE WELL-SPOKEN WOMAN stepped to the mike with a tone of both jesting confession and sincere curiosity.
“So I’m one of those maligned educators who was initially resistant [to graphic novels] and then was converted by a reluctant reader,” admitted the middle-school teacher, who, during an audience Q&A, sought guidance on tailoring lesson plans to narrative comics.
For those of us on this graphic-novel panel last April at Washington’s Politics & Prose bookstore (I was moderating with four creators), her words were eminently encouraging.
This — this — is the intellectual place all Reluctant Teachers should strive to arrive at.
Moved and motivated by the students themselves, these leaders are willing to do the homework necessary to be better educators.
They are eager to understand the scholarship behind small sequential pictures because they grasp the big picture: Approaches are ever evolving to reach grade-school minds.
One comics-maker who understands firsthand the questions posed by that Northwest Washington schoolteacher is Gene Luen Yang, a tremendously gifted storyteller.
Before Yang was a two-time finalist for the National Book Award, he was a high-school teacher who observed up close how some students respond better to visual learning.
As a tool for teaching, comics remains a relative toddler.
Smart educators know that illustrated storytelling engages many students in ways that straight prose cannot — but where do we go from there.
At the intersection of all this, Yang wisely realizes, is media.
Sitting in that wooden classroom desk now is a profoundly different experience from even a generation ago.
When digital images whir by in a fully multimedia world, today’s young eyes so commonly process images and audio, text and graphics within a single screen or document — without memory of a time when information was synthesized in less multitracked ways.
It’s no wonder that the gap from Internet consumption to linear prose on a dog-eared page has become such a yawning chasm — emphasis, for the next Gutenberg-averse generation, on yawn.
Online life stimulates the brain’s pathways like a dense urban grid; the repetitive ping-ponging eye action of reading a line-by-line hard copy of “Fahrenheit 451,” by contrast, is the gray-matter equivalent of a dusty country road.
(Is it only a matter of time before it’s the Tumblr-jacked students who dream of burning their paper books.
) What Yang understands is that comics storytelling — by virtue of combining two disparate media — more closely resembles the modern multigraphic experience of going online.
Fortunately for such juiced-retina readers, Yang’s comprehension of that dynamic translates to the page.
In September, Yang released a two-book epic titled “Boxers & Saints” (First Second Books/Macmillan) — companion tales set during the Boxer Rebellion.
Appropriate to the contrasting content, the stories are pitched quite differently: “Boxers” is a brightly colored ad­ven­ture tale of sweep and swift action, as the Boxers — these farmers-turned-warriors — leave their villages on their bloody march to Peking.
“Saints,” on the other hand, is a quieter, mostly monochromatic story of Chinese Christians on the rival end of this dawn-of-the-20th-century clash.
“Boxers” particularly flashes elements of a superhero book — Yang even knowingly invokes the visual language of an American caped-hero comic — as villagers inherit empowering identities with enough drama to fuel both a Marvel arc and a Chinese opera.
Yet what attentive teacher couldn’t also mine this two-book set (combined, nearly 500 pages) to teach themes of religion and race (Yang was attracted to this history as a product of his Chinese Catholic community) — as well as the narrative sense of offsetting sympathies, when humanity feels divided, righteously pitted on either end of a sword.
The Obstinate Educator — the one with no shelf space for graphic novels — might be disgruntled to learn that on the strength of “Boxers & Saints,” Yang this year became the first graphic novelist to be a two-time finalist for the National Book Award (his first nod was for 2006’s “American Born Chinese”).
Although Yang ultimately didn’t win the big prize for Young People’s Literature, he’s a relentless talent — on the page and in the classroom.
And if the industry ever plans to stage a comics rebellion upon the American education system, Yang — careful storyteller that he is — will be just the man to plot it.
AS THE WOMAN in the chunky glasses and funky-cool hat strode up the podium — taking center stage beneath the National Book Festival tent last autumn — twin gifts imminently became obvious.
First was that voice, as warm and inviting as afternoon bathwater.
Folks were somewhat loosely spread out across the phalanxes of folding chairs, but her conspiratorial vocal tone caused the listeners to be rapt as one.
Then there was that second magnetic quality: This woman had a knack for ticking off so many skewed human truths — rat-a-tat-tat — that the room's shared humor soon came to a full beautiful boil.
As she waxed insightful about the mysteries of the mind, it was as if each of our own craniums were peering into a fun-house mirror, recognizing both its reflection and the wonderful warp.
It is not by accident that this woman is such an uproarious docent into our own wacky wiring.
Lynda Barry, one of the fest's featured speakers, was an alt-weekly cartoonist for years, building a devoted following for “Ernie Pook's Comeek” — a feature whose lines and emotional tone could sometimes be sharp and frantic.
More recently, though, Barry has moved into academia; as a professor at the University of Wisconsin, she teaches courses that plumb the ways and means of creativity — leading inventive exercises that unlock cranial traits and tics and curiosities.
She has her students assume names taken from terms for parts of the brain, for instance; even after the semester's long past, your classmates might only call you Hippocampus around the ol' campus.
This is the merry mischief that helps open her students' minds to understand their own gray-matter grid, where languages verbal and visual cause the brain to spark electrically across the hemispheres.
Barry is fascinated by how we process words and pictures in our heads, because she is passionate about how this dynamic text-image relationship plays out on the page.
Would that we could see Barry's brain activity if she were wired while creating her latest comic book, “The Freddie Stories” (Drawn + Quarterly).
Barry says that her favorite comic strip as a kid was "Family Circus," because its nuclear warmth and order ran so counter to her own troubled childhood.
To peel back the cover of “The Freddie Stories” — which collects some of her old comics and adds a prologue of new strips — is to venture to some dark places.
Young Freddie, who seems to be grappling with both his mental health and his sexual orientation, is under siege from without and within by profound fears and anxieties — some clearly real, others perhaps manufactured.
Homes are lost to arson, friends are lost to cruel words, and we grow concerned for the boy's well-being.
The trick here is, no matter how many horrors Barry visits upon her protagonist, he always rings multidimensional and real — even when he's so fleshed out that he sort of makes our own flesh crawl.
Can we really call all his adventures flights of dark fantasy when anyone's tortured adolescence might feel plenty horrific from the inside.
This is part of Barry's storytelling genius.
Whether she's giving a cheery festival talk or spinning a chilling tale of childhood, she expertly strings together those home truths of humanity.
As an educator who promotes comics as a classroom boon, Barry is also ever aware of the pictures.
Nearly every panel of the new book is dominated by uncramped block lettering — which results in often compressing Freddie's visual existence into a fraction of the frame.
Even in his own book, poor Freddie is externally hounded not only by worldly terrors, but also by wordy terrors.
As his psychological makeup tries to withstand daily life, even the physical makeup of the page conspires against him.
The images, as tight as they are, resonate with everything we need to know about Freddie's mental state.
His environment is so jagged and ragged, the only edge sharper is Barry's piercing levity.
We laugh but to keep from shuddering.
Is "The Freddie Stories, " you might ask, too chilling for the children — say, middle- and high school.
Well, measured against the actual adolescence of many kids, enjoying a little schadenfreude at Freddie's fictional expense is positively a laff riot.
IF ED PISKOR had spent more of his high-school years on campus, he might not be the cartoonist he is today.
Up till now, of course, we’ve dwelled on how incorporating comics into the curriculum can especially benefit some types of struggling students.
But how can comics help you if you never go to school.
Piskor and I are talking at the 2013 Small Press Expo, which is held each September in Maryland, just outside Washington.
The 31-year-old artist is recounting how hard it was at times to be home-schooled during his prep years; he became very sick at age 15, he says (he declines to go into further detail about the extended illness), and teachers only came to his Pittsburgh-area home several hours a week to provide instruction.
This is no scenario to be wished for, but it did have at least one silver lining: Piskor had countless hours to pour into his pencil-and-paper obsession.
He grew by leaps and bounds as a cartoonist, and with so much time working in creative solitude, he could experiment at length as he drew comics about his pop-culture interests: pro wrestling, and gritty ‘70s-era films — and, most intensely, hip hop.
This past fall, Piskor delivered a passion project that is his best realized vision to date: the large-format, 112-page comic, “Hip Hop Family Tree” (Fantagraphics).
From beginning to end-paper, the comic is testament to attention to detail.
Splashed across the cover is the title rendered in bold graffiti typography.
Crack the cover and you’re greeted with the perfectly yellowed aesthetic of a vintage book; only the new-comic smell immediately gives away that you’re not holding a well-kept ‘70s relic.
Some cartoonists strive to create comic books that reflect the would-be literary import of the term “graphic novel.
” (It’s an inexact term popularized by the comics legend Will Eisner that many in the industry still wrestle with.
) Piskor — who got his first big break drawing for the late-great Harvey Pekar, that blue-collar bard of autobiographical comics — puts on no pretensions: He just wants to make “cool comics.
” Yet by delving into music and mining his encyclopedic knowledge of early hip-hop culture for narrative gems, Piskor has come up with a stunning piece of docu-journalism through the medium of limited-palette comics.
From the musical prophets to the profiteers, from the MCs to the VIPs, the cartoonist keeps all the plot-lines playing out harmoniously in concert.
Bouncing from the Bronx to Harlem to Times Square, “Hip Hop Family Tree” flashes Piskor’s slick narrative moves, as a culture’s origin story is largely conveyed through a troupe of key real-life characters — be they on the playgrounds, under the spotlights or behind the scenes.
And making this textured world come alive is muscular, thick-lined art that utterly evokes the era.
Yet given this achievement, where does that leave Piskor’s place in the classroom.
In a spin of irony, the man who often was out of school now belongs in every school that will have him through this book.
His “graphic novel” satisfies a distinct need in classrooms and libraries: Literate comics that reflect a facet of life many students actually care about.
“Hip Hop Family Tree” depicts a time before the quest for conspicuous riches overshadowed much of the music’s highest-profile culture.
Fittingly, Piskor’s book feels just as real and authentic as the retro rap it celebrates.
AT THE BALTIMORE COMIC-CON last September, awards-night emcee Bill Willingham took the mike and settled in.
Willingham, the writer/artist behind the dark-fantasy comic “Fables,” had an elaborate sleight-of-tongue planned.
For a while, the audience seemed to have no idea where the cartoonist was taking us.
Gradually, though — like a large “splash panel” illustration being inked — we could glimpse where the veteran storyteller was headed in this sonorous end-around.
The context was this: Visual language is viewed by many as the less sophisticated kid brother to verbal language — as if when the arts are grouped for discussion, comics must pull up a seat at the card table for the tykes.
Prose novels are the mature form of creative expression, the thinking goes; sequential art is the potentially embarrassing teenager trying to party-crash and bum some booze.
But Willingham, as the kids say, flipped the script.
With an anthropologist’s care, the cartoonist laid out the history of visual language, tripping through the 17,000-year-old (give or take, oh, entire centuries) cave paintings of Lascaux and other acts of ancient sequential art.
His point was this: It is visual language, in fact, that is the wise, old Obi-Wan in this relationship.
But if the Johnny-Grunt-Lately verbal form of expression accords its elder a little respect, perhaps the visual artists will show him a thing or two.
That speech comes to mind because Joe Sacco, one of the world’s preeminent comics journalists — a master at captured dialogue from political hot-spots — has gone wordless.
Sacco is the recent author of “The Great War” (W.
), a mesmerizing, 24-plate illustrated panorama of “July 1, 1916: The First Day of the Battle of the Somme.
” Panel by panel, the bloody history literally unfolds before our eyes as the British— most notably the Devonshire Regiment — fight and fire and sustain some 57,000 casualties in a single day.
The sweeping artwork is silent; the actions tucked into most every square-inch of art-space speak volumes.
The Maltese-born Sacco has reported from Bosnia and Palestine and Iraq, but through all the danger zones, it is “the Great War” that has fascinated him since his childhood in Australia.
The long, violent slog over the slimmest of turf, and the psychology behind sanctioned mass killing, stirs him to mull how an identical human instinct — such as the ability to organize — can lead us to towering achievement, yet also bring us to scientifically precise slaughter.
It is the sheer scale of Sacco’s 24-foot accordion panorama that hammers home how massive a collective undertaking the 1916 battle was.
Inspired by a friend, Sacco had Matteo Pericoli’s “Manhattan Unfurled” in mind when he created “The Great War”; also in his thoughts was the Bayeux Tapestry depicting the Norman Invasion.
In such works, running an eye along the sequential art seems to provide not only coherent viewpoints, but also inherent points of view.
Sacco’s panorama, for instance, consciously elides time, as we move from troop preparation to troop devastation to, at story’s end, the poignant digging of gravesites.
This is artwork so intricate and accurate, you can lose yourself in the well-choreographed flow of bombardments and batallion aid posts and German barrages.
These are the front lines as Crumb-like cross-hatched lines — countless rounds of precision inking building the physical.
Sacco takes us into the sandbagged trenches, where in a brilliant trick, the troops register simultaneously as visually specific yet as a mass of the faceless — sacrificial men who will die by the hundreds as they run headlong into the guns.
So much about size and scope and tragic enormity can be lost in the translation when a student is perusing a textbook or half-sleeping through an in-class film.
But when gazing at Sacco’s painstakingly epic battleground, one reality can emerge as loud as a Howitzer: The individual act of walking into withering gunfire is courageous, but when war’s machinery chews up so many young lives, the human condition, Sacco says, can feel futile.
Let’s hope getting this book into students’ hands for spirited discussion is not.
THERE ARE MANY battle plans for waging a World War graphic novel.
For Joe Sacco, going wordless in “The Great War” removed the burden of reporting history as “comics journalism” — in which sending up word balloons for his text is his standard issue.
For Art Spiegelman, author of the landmark “Maus” epic, depicting the Holocaust through his father’s riveting flashbacks brought the pain and horror fully to the page.
(When the cartoonist revisited his files to create his recent “MetaMaus” retrospective, Spiegelman told me the experience was wrenching, reducing him to tears.
) And then there is Rutu Modan’s latest approach.
For her graphic novel “The Property” (Drawn + Quarterly), the Israeli cartoonist sought to write a family comedy with the Holocaust as historic backdrop.
Modan burst onto the world stage in 2007 as her gripping graphic novel “Exit Wounds” — about a young woman who roams Tel Aviv in search of a missing lover amid bomb attacks — won international acclaim.
This time out, it is an old woman in search of real estate lost while fleeing Warsaw during World War II.
Because land had been nationalized, Modan describes, recovery of property by survivors was near-impossible prior to the ‘90s, and remains difficult to this day.
“The Property” is rife with the memories of war and the present-day challenges of bureaucracy in Poland, but Modan does not creatively live there — perhaps, in part, because she’s never actually lived there.
Modan’s family is from Poland, but as a nation, it’s been a nonentity to her for much of her life.
Modan’s foremost gift is creating people who feel utterly real — in body and in spirit, in the flesh and in the kvetch.
To capture a sense of physical reality, Modan does something perhaps no other globally known cartoonist does: She hires actors and models to stage every scene, every frame of her comic.
This is an astoundingly painstaking approach, but the effect is a loose “clear line” style that, more often than not, simply nails the anatomy.
In subtle ways, a displacement of weight, or realignment of posture, or balance of moving bodies — movements that can prove artistically elusive to all but the most skilled and trained — reads to the eye just “right.
” There is reflected reality in so many such poses.
Also working in visual concert is the lettering, which is light and unassuming enough that it often recedes, forcing the eye to reckon first with the strong, blunt colors of our characters — most of whom have personalities to match.
Modan also has an acute ear for relationship truths.
In “The Property,” the old woman — who can pivot from doting to cantankerous on a dime – is based on the cartoonist’s own grandmothers; they were women of Warsaw who lost relatives in World War II, as well as property and, ultimately, their homeland.
In the graphic novel, the woman, Regina, is irascible and impossible but always lovable.
So what can young readers glean from all this.
The upside is clear: Warm characters and relationships — particularly the sly back-and-forth between grandma and granddaughter — make this an accessible and unintimidating way for teen students to approach the larger fallout of war.
WHAT REASON does a kid even have to seek out a comic.
For all this talk of their visual and verbal cross-appeal, Gilbert Hernandez isn’t so sure print comics are some magic educational elixir in 2014.
“I think comics could be a good learning tool if they're only my comics,” quips Hernandez, the “Love & Rockets” rock star of a cartoonist (along with brother/co-creator Jaime Hernandez).
Jokes aside, Hernandez sees comics as falling ever off the radar of the next generation.
The youngest would-be readers have too much content on too many screens competing for their eyes.
Comic books, as well as newspaper comics, are less and less a common experience.
The California-based cartoonist does have hope for comics, however, if parents and teachers are willing to introduce kids to comics before their age hits double digits.
The early introduction is everything.
The current environment for comics contrasts sharply with the semi-autobiographical world Hernandez builds in his recent all-ages graphic novel, “Marble Season” (Drawn + Quarterly).
The story, set in the early ‘60s, plays out true to a child’s summer day: Time feels irrelevant as a suburban neighborhood’s kids — most of them tweens and teens — come and go in a loose, random series of encounters and dares, taunts and teasing and spur-of-the-moment friendships.
The threat of the physical is present, but so is the promise of a newly discovered toy or ball or game.
It’s the pleasure of the pressure-less — adults are off-frame and nearly unmentioned, and with their absence comes the remarkable freedom from the darkening cloud of grownup tumult; instead we get tracts of inviting white space set against the lightly lined skies.
Although Charles Schulz’s “Peanuts” rarely dated its references or events, the fixed-era “Marble Season” feels like a kindred time-capsule to Charlie Brown’s strip.
Even visually, Hernandez eschews dramatic angles for mostly straight-on perspectives — seldom letting the characters in frame come in for an uncomfortable close-up, or stray too deep from view.
The effect is one of warm reassurance: We know these kids — perhaps many readers have been these kids — and even their sudden moves feel like safely familiar choreography.
“Marble Season” is such a pleasing story, it could convert many next-generation children into comics readers.
And because it’s a safe-for-all-ages work, we could get it in their hot little hands according to Hernandez’s wishes: While the kiddoes are still impressionably young.
AS SEVERAL COLLEAGUES and I toured a cartoon and rare prints collection at the Library of Congress, I was transfixed by a ’40s Sunday original of Alex Raymond’s syndicated ad­ven­ture strip “Jungle Jim.
” As I gazed at the titular hero wrestling a coiled tiger on its haunches, I then became aware of the cartoonist on my left, who was also studying this original up close.
“What do you think of his tiger.
The cartoonist next to me was “Calvin and Hobbes” creator Bill Watterson.
Right there, I was reminded of the undying allure of the deftly depicted fantasy/adventure scene.
All of “Calvin and Hobbes’s” boy-and-tiger banter rang with artistic genius, of course.
But Watterson’s flights-of-fantasy scenes — from dinosaur adventures to Spaceman Spiff — elevated an entire facet of the strip, which ended nearly two decades ago now.
And I’m reminded of some of my favorite Calvin imaginings when I read “Battling Boy” (First Second), Paul Pope’s new space/superhero/adventure fantasy comic.
It’s not that the two works are analagous; it’s simply the notion that Battling Boy — a wiry, blond teenager who’s learning to fend off monsters as he fights for his life — could be how Calvin might have imagined himself as an adolescent superhero.
At least if Watterson had spent the week binge-reading Moebius and Jack Kirby.
Pope brings all his skills to the table for this book.
The action scenes are dazzling; movement and smoke and explosions are rendered in beautifully fluid lines (the ink laid down just so); and the man/monster clashes feel epic.
The dialogue is kept relatively minimal, but this is the sort of book that could turn a reluctant reader into an aspiring wordmaster.
Just like “Calvin and Hobbes” so often used to do — and, in the case of my young relative, still does.
SO MANY biographical histories are so solemn and worshipful — it’s refreshing to see one that has as much fun as its subject had.
Peter Bagge was tripping through history’s pages to find a woman pioneer’s story to render into art.
As he scoured about, the Harvey Award-winning cartoonist noticed a frequent factor: Many of these early 20th-century women making headlines curiously had no children.
Following that line of physiological logic, all roads led to one home: Margaret Sanger, that pioneer of birth control, had profoundly altered her era — and so earned a place beneath Bagge’s comics microscope.
With his exaggerated, rubbery and rounded style interacting with this woman rebel’s unbridled and oft-boundless life, this brainchild of a graphic novel is a creative congress that gives Ms.
Sanger something she never had in her own life: “Woman Rebel: The Margaret Sanger Story” (Drawn + Quarterly) is factual biography as wild ride.
In researching Sanger, Bagge (so well-known for his comic “Hate”) discovered over-the-top escapades from a person who curated a somber image for politics’ sake.
He knew he’d struck narrative gold.
Bagge’s line is as spirited as Sanger’s life; with her expressive eyes and protruding lips shining beneath blazing auburn hair, Sanger holds center stage as a trailblazer irrepressible.
Bagge also deftly manages to pack considerable text into these pages — without the words ever overwhelming the images — and 18 pages of post-story indexed references help do some of the historic heavy-lifting.
As for educators, we offer one caveat, however: Sanger’s intimate story, in a scene or three, seems a mite too randy for your middle-school library; teachers would be advised to leave the moments of bodily bawdiness to the high-schoolers.
WHO BETTER to deliver young-adult literature to classrooms and libraries than a creator who was a “reluctant reader” himself.
“Zits” comic co-creator Jerry Scott was a prep freshman in Arizona — and the new kid, to boot — when he had a near-impossible time reading Walter Scott’s “Ivanhoe.
” “Reading it was really hard — it was the worst frigging book,” Scott told me earlier this year.
“There were no pictures at all.
I don’t think I’m alone in this vast sea of alienation that a lot of kids feel.
” That feeling helped spawn this year’s “Zits: Chillax,” an excellent illustrated novel that features all the lead characters from the popular King Features strip — as lanky teen Jeremy Duncan angles to go to his first rock concert.
In terms of nomenclature, the emphasis here, by the way, is on “illustrated novel” — in contrast to the graphic novel, these “hybrid” works contain sizable stretches of straight text (“Chillax” is 240 pages, with cartoon art cumulatively accounting for roughly half those).
As successive generations of readers move away from daily comic strips, “Chillax” also reflects a significant marketplace shift: It’s just the latest illustrated kids’ novel to come from a newspaper-strip cartoonist.
Scott and Jim Borgman follow on the heels of “Pearls Before Swine” cartoonist Stephan Pastis, who this year released the kids’ book “Timmy Failure,” and “Big Nate” creator Lincoln Peirce, whose feature soared in popularity after launching on PopTropica.
And perhaps they all can give a little thanks to Jeff Kinney, the Maryland-sprung writer/cartoonist who created the “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” mega-franchise.
In recent years, Kinney has helped engage a new generation of young readers — largely those pre-teen grade-schoolers who will read healthy swaths of text if broken up even only occasionally by deceptively simple art and hand lettering, which function as winking visual cues of a non-threatening aesthetic.
As this trend continues to swell, it’s looking like the Decade of the Hybrid Novel.
And the kicker about this emergence: Many parents and educators have embraced the illustrated novel as transitional tool.
Now, between the graphic novel and the hybrid novel, let’s hope the persistent empty prejudices against such works will fall.
Because graphic lit’s current biggest battle is not one of providing quality stories, but of recasting public perception of the illustrated medium — and educators stand smack on the front lines of shifting perspective.

Pity the poor patient who tries to make sense of federal advisory committee reports that appear headed in opposite directions.
For at least three decades, Americans have been told that it’s best to detect cancers early, when they are theoretically most curable.
So it was not all that surprising when an authoritative advisory group recommended that very heavy smokers get an annual CT scan to check for early signs of lung cancer.
It was much more surprising, however, when a separate group of experts suggested that for several cancers — including potential lung cancers — early scans are detecting too many abnormalities that aren’t dangerous and should not be treated.
Oddly enough, both groups, which issued their recommendations last Monday, may be right.
The recommendation on smokers came from the United States Preventive Services Task Force, independent experts who serve as the federal government’s foremost authority on screening procedures.
Screening with chest X-rays, long the standard approach, seldom catches a tumor early enough for surgeons to save a life.
In 2010, however, a large clinical trial found that low-dose CT scans, which detect much smaller tumors, could reduce mortality by 16 percent among patients at the highest risk of lung cancer because of their age and smoking history.
That led several prominent medical groups to recommend such screening in high-risk current and former smokers.
Now, based primarily on that same study, the Preventive Services Task Force, the final arbiter, has recommended that people ages 55 to 79 who have smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for 30 years or two packs a day for 15 years or the equivalent get annual CT scans.
That includes former smokers who have quit within the past 15 years.
It estimates that such screening could save 20,000 lives a year, among the 160,000 Americans who die each year of lung cancer.
The task force said it had “moderate certainty” that the screening would produce a “moderate net benefit” in these high-risk smokers but did not know whether the same would be true in lower-risk patients.
It gave lung cancer screening a grade of B, on a par with mammography.
Under the Affordable Care Act, that would require Medicare and private insurers to pay for the screening tests without any cost to consumers.
Meanwhile, three members of a working group advising the National Cancer Institute, the federal government’s pre-eminent supporter of cancer research, suggested that “overdiagnosis” — the detection of tumors that would not cause illness or death if left unattended — is common in cases of breast, lung, prostate and thyroid cancer.
Such overdiagnosis often leads to further tests and biopsies to determine if a tiny tumor looks dangerous, followed by surgery, radiation or chemotherapy to eliminate an abnormality that would never have caused illness.
In such cases, the cure is worse than the disease it is trying to prevent.
The group said that, ideally, screening tests should focus on tumors that will cause harm and are more likely to be cured if detected early.
But that can’t be done until scientists find better ways to identify which lesions are truly worrisome.
The group also proposed renaming some conditions to exclude the word cancer so that patients might be less frightened and less apt to press for unneeded tests and treatments.
For instance, the tiny breast tumors called ductal carcinoma in situ would be renamed to exclude the word carcinoma.
Recommendations from both these groups come with uncertainties and unanswered questions.
This will put the burden on patients, in consultation with their doctors, to decide whether to get early screening for various cancers and what to do based on the findings.

The resolution passed on Wednesday local time (Thursday morning (AEST) requires all countries to adopt laws that would make it a serious crime for their nationals to join jihadist groups such as Islamic State and Al-Nusra Front.
The resolution falls under Chapter 7 of the UN charter, which means the measures could be enforced by economic sanctions or military force.
Earlier, opening the assembly, Mr Obama vowed to destroy the Islamic State ‘network of death’ and warned the world that humanity’s future was at stake in a battle against extremism which would last a generation.
As the Pentagon confirmed a third wave of air strikes inside Syria, Mr Obama called on all nations to join the battle against IS terrorists.
He smoke of a “pervasive unease in our world” as it faces an unprecedented Ebola outbreak, increased Russian aggression in Europe and “the brutality of terrorists in Syria and Iraq (that) forces us to look into the heart of darkness.
” He added: “There can be no reasoning — no negotiation — with this brand of evil.
The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force.
So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death.
” He insisted that the US would not be an occupying power and called on the world to join the coalition against Islamic terrorism.
In the UK, David Cameron said he would recall parliament to seek MPs’ approval for British involvement in air strikes in Iraq.
MPs will return to Westminster on Friday for a vote that would allow RAF planes to join the US, France and a number of Arab states in bombing raids on IS positions.
Mr Cameron said he was responding to a request for assistance from Haider al-Abadi, the Iraqi Prime Minister.
“What we are doing is legal, it is right, it does not involve British troops on the ground,” he said.
“As ever with our country, when we are threatened in this way we should not turn away from what needs to be done.
” However he said action would be restricted to Iraq and any extension of air strikes to syria would require a further vote.
The campaign in Iraq will also be joined by six Dutch F-16 fighter bombers, Deputy Prime Minister Lodewijk Asscher announced on Wednesday.
“The Netherlands will make six F-16s available for the first phase of the campaign, for one year,” Asscher told reporters after an emergency cabinet meeting in The Hague.
The jets will “most likely” fly from bases in Jordan and could be operational within a week, Dutch Defence Minister Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert said.
An advance Dutch military team was to depart for the region on Thursday, she added.
Apart from the F-16s, the Netherlands will also deploy 250 military personnel and 130 trainers for the Iraqi military.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said last week there were legal obstacles to the Netherlands launching air strikes on Islamists in Iraq’s neighbour Syria without a UN mandate.
“There is currently no international agreement for a military deployment to Syria,” Asscher said on Wednesday.
“In Iraq’s case there is a clear request.
A request by Iraq’s legitimate government gives us a sufficient mandate to deploy the Dutch military” there, he said.
At the UN, Jordan’s King Abdullah II also called for a collective strategy to defeat militants who threaten global security.
“The terrorists and criminals targeting Syria, Iraq and other countries today are extreme reflections of a great global threat,” King Abdullah told the 193-member General Assembly.
“Our international community needs a collective strategy to contain and defeat these groups.
My country is at the forefront of this effort.
” Jordan is one of five Arab countries to have taken part in US-led air strikes against the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria and Iraq.
Shortly before King Abdullah’s speech, two US defence officials said Jordanian planes on Wednesday bombed IS on the second day of a US-led air campaign.
The King said Jordan would also submit a draft resolution to the United Nations that would consider “aberrant” crimes against religious communities in Iraq and Syria as crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity.
About the album, Mothership Connection, Clinton said “We had put black people in situations nobody ever thought they would be in, like the White House.
I figured another place you wouldn't think black people would be was in outer space.
I was a big fan of Star Trek, so we did a thing with a pimp sitting in a spaceship shaped like a Cadillac, and we did all these James Brown-type grooves, but with street talk and ghetto slang.
” Like Sun Ra, Clinton wanted to see black people in space – but Clinton wanted to do it in a much more inclusive way.
When Bootsy Collins started working with George Clinton, he brought the “on the one” philosophy – the idea that everyone is on the same pulse with the rhythm of the universe, that everything will be together and that that makes all connections stronger.
Clinton’s music definitely had a message, but where Sun Ra almost handpicked the people who were allowed to go with him into space, Clinton was all-inclusive.
It is important for these afrofuturistic works to play with and almost recreate mythology as we’ve come to know it because with black people, it’s virtually impossible to know exactly where they come from and what their history is.
In his music, Clinton takes that idea, internalizes it and immortalizes it with his music but completely changes the meaning in doing so.
There is no kind of stigma that comes with mixing of voices, instruments, personalities and background as Clinton uses them in his music and in that kind of inclusion he’s removing the stigma of being black in America and not knowing your own history.
That’s what puts Clinton in a category with Ishmael Reed, Samuel R.
Butler and their use of technology to comment on the experience of black people.
Music is the technology Clinton has chosen to employ and like all three authors, he has used it to make a comment on what happened in the past and also to change its context to allow people to have more agency in changing the present and shaping the future.
The music Clinton produced with the Parliaments and the Funkadelics engaged all peoples and it carried a message.
All the sci-fi aspects of p-funk are what situate Clinton’s work in an afrofuturistic setting, but also the idea that he took the shared experience of a people – a negative one, at that – and gave it back to those people therefore giving them tremendously more agency than they’d had before.
He connected groups of people and performed in front of mixed audiences where it seemed like the problems that had been keeping these people apart for so long didn’t exist.
ILHAM TOHTI rarely worries about his personal safety here — at least not at the hands of would-be thieves.
Tohti, an economics professor and unofficial spokesman for this country’s embattled Uighur minority, frequently has a police escort.
Whether they are looking out for his well-being is another matter.
“You may not see them, especially if I’m out with friends, but they’re there,” said Mr.
Tohti, 41, whose ever-present smile seems to convey more sadness than joy.
He looked at the number, put his fingers to his lips and whispered “domestic security.
” After a quick exchange with his minders, Mr.
Tohti hung up and lit yet another cigarette.
“They’re very angry with me,” he said sitting in his Beijing apartment.
“They told me very clearly that I may be in grave danger.
” These are precarious times for Mr.
Tohti, a brazenly outspoken spark plug of a man whose advocacy for China’s Turkic-speaking Muslim Uighurs has landed him on the government’s list of citizens who warrant near-constant surveillance.
Last July, after ethnic bloodletting in the far western region of Xinjiang killed 197 people, the governor appeared on television to accuse Rebiya Kadeer, the exiled Uighur leader, of inciting the violence, much of which involved Uighur mobs bludgeoning Han Chinese migrants in Urumqi, the regional capital.
Then he parceled out some of the blame to Mr.
net, a lively forum for debate — and a platform for rumormongering, according to the government — before it was blocked by the censors.
The next day, security agents from Beijing took him on what he said they called a “vacation” for three weeks, interrogating him for long periods and warning him to stop publicly criticizing the government’s policies and practices in Xinjiang.
The agents later decamped to his living room, although Mr.
Tohti declined to describe the experience for fear he might incur their wrath.
“Sometimes they were nice to me, but other times they said, ‘We can crush you like an ant,’ ” he said.
It is not clear why they have not crushed him yet.
Since the unrest of last summer, the authorities have had little compunction about detaining scores of Uighurs whose whereabouts remain a mystery.
In recent weeks, several have been given long prison terms, including three Web masters and a journalist who were convicted for endangering the Chinese state.
The longest sentence, 15 years, was handed down to Gheyret Niyaz, a 51-year-old writer who worked for Mr.
Niyaz’ greatest crime was speaking to a magazine in Hong Kong.
His fate has weighed heavily on Mr.
Tohti and increased his already perilous levels of garrulousness.
“They say I’m hyping up his case and that I have to stop talking to the media, but I just can’t help myself,” he said, adding another cigarette butt to an overflowing ashtray.
As one of the few prominent Uighur intellectuals living in China, Mr.
Tohti said he felt he had no choice but to speak out against the discrimination and economic inequality he says fuel Uighur resentment, some of which ends up directed at the Han migrants who have been encouraged to move west by the millions.
According to the most recent census in 2000, the Han make up 40 percent of Xinjiang’s population, up from less than 5 percent when the Communist Party took power in 1949.
Although the central government recently pledged to invest billions of dollars in Xinjiang, Mr.
Tohti says no amount of money can assuage the widespread feeling that the culture and language of the region’s 10 million Uighurs are increasingly threatened by assimilation.
It does not help that most government positions and jobs in Xinjiang’s booming oil and gas industries go to the Han.
HE also has harsh words for China’s leaders, who he says pay lip service to the autonomy promised by Chinese law.
“I am worried that many of my people might be driven to extremism,” he said.
Such extremism may have been behind an explosion this week that killed seven people in Aksu, a predominantly Uighur city not far from Mr.
Tohti knows his frank words have had unintended consequences for those closest to him.
His first marriage ended in divorce after his wife, spooked by sirens and jolted by every knock at the door, returned to Xinjiang with their young son.
Last year his second wife also fled Beijing, and later she gave birth to their second child.
He admits that the stroke that nearly killed his mother recently may have been brought on by her anxiety over his safety.
“She said she would have never allowed me to go to school if she knew I would turn out like this,” he said.
He has more than a dozen relatives in Xinjiang who work in public security, including two brothers who have made repeated trips to Beijing in an effort to persuade Mr.
Tohti to tone down his rhetoric, and perhaps ease the pressure from their own superiors.
It is not entirely clear whether his prominence has so far saved him from a worse fate.
Wang Lixiong, a well-known writer who studies Xinjiang, said that fame rarely saves high-profile dissidents.
“It could just be that different powers and interests within the government are divided over what to do about him,” Mr.
“But at some point, a higher authority might decide to step in and do something.
” BORN in Atush, an ancient outpost on the northern branch of the Silk Road, Mr.
Tohti says he was a diligent, if slightly distracted, student.
His father, educated at Beijing Normal University, died when Mr.
Tohti was 2 under circumstances he still does not understand.
“I’m afraid to ask my mother, because the subject is too painful for the both of us,” he said.
In the sixth grade, he became acutely aware that the Uighurs and the Han in Atush lived differently.
It was the summer of 1980, when a crowd of Uighur children tried to force their way into a movie theater reserved for Han.
During a scuffle with Chinese soldiers, a Uighur boy was grievously injured and in the melee that followed, Mr.
Tohti joined a rampaging mob that smashed every light bulb and window in sight.
“Because these are things the Han had; we lived in primitive dwellings,” he recalled.
“I think that’s when many Uighurs opened their eyes and saw what was happening around them.
” For now, he still has his teaching job at Minzu University of China, where his classes are a popular draw among Uighur students.
Not surprisingly, his lectures tend to be fiery.
They have also become popular keepsakes, recorded and surreptitiously passed among Uighurs around the country.
Students are not the only ones interested in his talks.
Not long ago he noticed a surveillance camera mounted in the ceiling of his classroom.
Soon afterward, he realized that even when he changed rooms, the cameras followed him.
“A coincidence perhaps,” he said with a grin.
Tohti could probably leave the country and become a Uighur exile, but he refuses to entertain the thought.
Only by staying in China, he said, can he help Mr.
Niyaz and other jailed Uighurs.
He also feels an obligation to his students, many of whom are still unemployed years after graduation.
“As a teacher, I feel like I have failed them,” he said.
“If things here don’t change as quickly as I’d like, sooner or later I will be doomed,” he said.
“Perhaps I will be sent to hell, but I don’t care because in some ways I am already there.
The harder you look at Carrie Mae Weems’s “Slow Fade to Black” — blurred, soft-focus images of mid-20th century stars like Marian Anderson, Dorothy Dandridge, Billie Holiday and Eartha Kitt — the more you see.
As the title suggests, these striking, ethereal images, several of which appear in Ms.
Weems’s retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in New York (on view through May 14), play on the concept of the cinematic fade, the transition of an image to or from a blank screen.
The freeze-frame makes it impossible to tell whether the scenes are fading out or fading in — whether the women themselves are disappearing or materializing.
Some viewers, especially younger ones, will not recognize them.
But memories may be jarred loose for older viewers as they gradually discern familiar features, postures and gestures.
Weems, “Slow Fade to Black” is foremost about rekindling interest in path-setting African-American entertainers who have vanished from our collective imagination.
“I started to realize that I rarely heard mention of these women,” she said.
“Unless, I was playing them on CDs in my own home, I didn’t hear them or see them much anymore.
These women have given us a gift and a legacy, and yet we have forgotten them.
They are disappearing, dissolving before our eyes.
” This disappearance is not just a result of generational differences, but prejudice, too.
While many white stars from the period, like Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe, continue to be remembered, celebrated and lucratively marketed, equally important black performers remain largely unknown to most Americans.
Weems added that the “way women are cast aside when they age” linked this vanishing to gender, too.
“There is something very painful and poignant about this,” she said.
On one level, the photographs, on the verge of dissolution, serve as metaphors of past struggles to remain visible and relevant in a culture that, at best, relegated many of these women to the sidelines.
Viewed in this historical context, it is difficult to separate what we know about their subjugation — the stereotypical roles, the lack of financial reward, isolation — from their extraordinary and trailblazing work.
The meaning of these images is fluid and depends on whether viewers see the subjects as stars burning out from cultural memory or historic figures with far-reaching, and still relevant, legacies.
They pose compelling questions not just about their lives but also about the incandescence and fragility of fame, the prejudices that define, limit or make it impossible, and an obsession with youth that continues to dictate who becomes famous — and for how long.
But “Slow Fade to Black” asks us to behold its subjects anew.
Rather than static icons of racial martyrdom or stereotypes of black divas, they are represented as the consummate entertainers they were.
The diaphanous and cinematic photographs give the illusion of animation as they capture the flourishes of performance — mouths open in song, hands gesturing theatrically, and hips and shoulders swaying to unheard music.
The stars are represented in decisive or memorable career moments.
By basing her images on publicity stills, Ms.
Weems presents the women not necessarily as they wanted to be seen but as photographers, editors and art directors chose to represent them: Ms.
Anderson singing before a bank of microphones, the Lincoln Memorial looming behind her; Mahalia Jackson, eyes closed, enraptured in song; Nina Simone at the piano, pendulous earrings dangling; an emoting Ethel Waters, her hands waving emphatically; the face of Ms.
Holiday emerging out of darkness, a huge flower in her hair; the dancer Katherine Dunham, in full headdress, striking a pose.
Ultimately, these images show how photography itself creates celebrity and how we honor and remember the famous.
They remind us, too, of the potent relationship between photography and memory, not just as a vehicle through which the latter is preserved but also as a powerful and evocative medium for both making visible and restoring to history forgotten, but no less extraordinary, people.
Weems views her photographs as fundamentally about “memory, about what we remember at various points in our lives,” she acknowledges, with a sense of urgency, that for many Americans such memories do not exist.
“I am of a certain generation where often I have to tell people who someone is,” she said.
To help remember and celebrate these women, Ms.
Weems collaborated with the pianist and composer Geri Allen in a multimedia performance at Celebrate Brooklyn.
, the Prospect Park summer festival of performing arts and film, in 2012, where projections of photographs from her series were accompanied by music by Ms.
“I first and foremost view this as an evening of music, centered on this idea of a woman’s journey, the span of a life,” Ms.
She now hopes that “Slow Fade to Black” will inspire a new generation to learn about these extraordinary women.
“When I speak with young people about the series, I tell them: ‘Do your research.
But now you have to dig considerably deeper to locate them.

Police officers wait to move in to arrest demonstrators on Broadway following the Flood Wall Street protest after asking them to disperse on September 22, 2014 in New York City.
The Flood Wall Street protest came on the heels of the climate change march on September 21 that attracted over 300,000 protestors.
(Photo by Bryan Thomas/Getty Images) | Bryan Thomas via Getty Images NEW YORK -- Thousands of protesters shut down blocks of Broadway in Lower Manhattan for hours on Monday in a demonstration that cast the blame for climate change squarely on Wall Street.
A brief, dramatic attempt by marchers to take Wall Street itself was met with police pepper spray.
Despite the NYPD's tally of 104 arrests -- including one of a man in a polar bear costume -- the overall mood was markedly more contained than the Occupy Wall Street protests that began three years ago this week.
All but two of the arrestees chose to be taken in, defying six police orders to disperse.
"The world seems like it's ending, and it's the only thing I can think of to do," 56-year-old Seth Tobocman told HuffPost just before he was arrested.
Monday's Flood Wall Street demonstration had a more frankly anti-capitalist message than the massive march that took over midtown Manhattan the day before.
Many of those present were veterans of Occupy, including organizers like Lisa Fithian, dubbed "Professor Occupy" for her role in teaching tactics to that movement.
"I feel like the source of all our problems in the world is coming from the very top of the financial ladder," said Jordan, a 23-year-old college student who skipped class to attend the protest.
He declined to give his last name.
The day began with speakers from places as diverse as Mexico and Mali using an Occupy-style human mic in Battery Park to speak about capitalism's ill effects on their homes.
Most protesters, however, were from places closer to New York.
One was Sonia Little, a Mashpee Wampanoag Native American who lives in Massachusetts.
Little also attended the People's Climate March, which organizers claimed drew more than 300,000 supporters.
She said Monday's protest got "a little crazy" compared to that event, but she was buoyed by the energy of both demonstrations.
"Indigenous people have been getting the raw end of greed for 500 years," said Little, a house painter and student.
For hours during the day, protesters sat surrounding the famous Charging Bull sculpture near Wall Street, even bouncing giant "carbon bubbles" off its bronze horns.
Many who sat around it expected immediate arrests.
But in the first big test of protest policing under Mayor Bill De Blasio, the police instead gave protesters hours to discuss politics and sing along to a radical marching band's rendition of the Twisted Sister classic, "We're Not Gonna Take It.
" "I think part of it has to be the difference between De Blasio and Bloomberg, because I think Bloomberg is part of Wall Street, he's a plutocrat," explained Max Berger, who was an organizer with the Occupy movement, referring to former mayor Michael Bloomberg.
By contrast, De Blasio, he pointed out, had criticized Bloomberg for violating Occupiers' First Amendment rights.
While a white-shirted police superior at one point told subordinates to be "nice and easy" with arrestees, the day was not without conflict.
As protesters attempted to move onto Wall Street for the New York Stock Exchange's closing bell, they were met by a phalanx of officers holding up barricades.
A few charged the barriers and were pushed back.
After minutes of back-and-forth struggle, one officer let loose a stream of pepper spray into several protesters' eyes.
As video confirms, he had seconds before been chatting with an officer.
Donovan said he'd been trying to explain that he had a free speech right to protest on Wall Street itself.
"Apparently they disagreed with me," he told HuffPost, his faced drenched with water to wash away the spray.
, the police ordered protesters who remained at the same intersection of Broadway and Wall Street to disperse.
For the next hour and a half, those who chose to stay were led away in plastic FlexiCuffs one by one.
A protester's boombox blasted "Turn Down for What" by DJ Snake and Lil Jon.
NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton himself oversaw the last handful of arrests.
The protesters on both sides of the barricades continued cheering.
" shouted one woman, as she was taken away to a waiting police bus.
From the Daily News: It's like 2009 all over again: Mayor Bloomberg is buying almost $1 million worth of campaign-style TV ads featuring him as a bold leader fighting for New York.
"Everyone knows these are tough times.
Mike Bloomberg's solution is built on our core values," an announcer intones.
"Independence - not for the special interests, but for all New Yorkers.
" The ad features summertime images of the mayor talking with business people and schoolchildren, intercut with school buses and construction crews - all of which was left over from campaign footage his admen shot in 2009 but never used.
The mayor's advisers say he's pushing back against a $3 million union ad campaign advocating a "millionaire's tax" on the rich instead of deep cuts in the state budget.
Central Command on Tuesday released video of overnight U.
The military airstrikes included the use of Tomahawk cruise missiles launched by the Navy from the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea.
CENTCOM) The four Persian Gulf nations whose warplanes flew in concert with U.
jets over Syria this week have spent the past few years acting with far less harmony, riven by divergent approaches to address the growth of Islamist political movements in the Arab world.
The differences among the countries have grown so stark and acrimonious that earlier this year, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain withdrew their ambassadors from Qatar, which has funded Islamists across the region to the consternation of the other three nations.
In the months that followed, they have continued to wage a proxy war of sorts in Egypt and Libya, where the UAE recently conducted airstrikes against rebels backed by Qatar.
Qatar’s neighbors accused it of bankrolling terrorists.
Qataris accused their neighbors of supporting strongmen who subvert the will of the people.
But with the Islamic State waving its black flag at the gates of Baghdad, Persian Gulf nations have decided to set aside their differences.
“Radical Islam is a profound threat to us and our values,” said Yousef al-Otaiba, the UAE’s ambassador to the United States.
“We need to confront it as a team.
” The airstrikes in Syria were an unprecedented act of Arab military cooperation that involved Saudi Arabia bombing fellow Sunni Muslims, the launching of U.
F-22 Raptor warplanes — employed in combat for the first time — from a base in the UAE, and the Royal Bahrain Air Force flying its inaugural combat missions.
“This was — and we hope will continue to be — a remarkable act of partnership among our allies in the gulf,” said a senior U.
military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the operation.
The militants have seized the key Iraqi crossing to Jordan, and the Islamic State’s leaders have expressed a thirst to charge a few hundred miles south through the desert to the Saudi holy city of Mecca and eventually impose their harsh brand of Islamic law from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean.
Even though Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE do not face the same immediate risks as Jordan and Saudi Arabia, an incursion onto Saudi soil could spark fear and unleash economic turmoil on the peninsula.
The Islamic State “represents a real and present danger” to the four countries and to Jordan, which also joined in the military operation, said Theodore Karasik, the director of research at the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis in Dubai, the UAE’s largest city.
That threat, he said, has been deemed by the countries “to be greater than what was happening among them.
” Several of the nations had sought military intervention against the Islamic State well in advance of President Obama’s decision to act.
In private conversations with U.
diplomats and military officials, Arab leaders conveyed a desire for a hard line against the militants weeks before the beheadings of two American journalists, which fueled opprobrium among the American public and led to new pressure on the White House.
Kerry traveled through the region last week to assemble the coalition, U.
and Arab officials said his principal task was not to convince some of the countries of the need to act, but to coordinate their efforts.
“It is the coalition of the more willing than we are,” said Will McCants, the director of the Project on U.
Relations with the Islamic World at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
“They’ve been begging the United States to take this leadership role for a while.
” The countries did not want to act without the United States in the lead.
firepower, intelligence and airborne coordination vital to the success of an air war in Syria, the U.
military official noted that all five countries regularly train with the U.
military and practice raids similar to those that were conducted on what was Tuesday morning in Syria.
-made fighter jets and dropped U.
-manufactured munitions on targets selected by the U.
Qatar’s willingness to participate took some of its neighbors by surprise, but they nonetheless welcomed it, the officials said.
Although Qatar’s support of Syrian opposition groups linked to the Muslim Brotherhood across the region has upset its neighbors — and led, in part, to the diplomatic breach — the Qatari government has insisted that it does not directly support the Islamic State; U.
officials, including Kerry, have said they have no evidence to the contrary.
Of larger concern to the UAE and Saudi Arabia has been Qatar’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, including the former government of Mohamed Morsi, who was deposed by a military coup.
The military chief who led the operation, Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, now presides over a government that has received generous financial support from Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
The UAE and Saudi Arabia have also been angered by Qatar’s support for a Libyan opposition group that seized the airport in the capital, Tripoli, and has established a rival government to the country’s elected parliament.
“There was very little trust among them,” McCants said of the gulf nations.
But the Islamic State was an enemy “they all could agree upon.
military and diplomatic officials are pleased with the cooperation thus far, they note that the most critical regional contributions have yet to come: a Saudi promise to establish training facilities for moderate Syrian rebels, bases for them in Jordan, participation of special-operations ground forces from some of the nations, and more-aggressive steps by Qatar and other nations to target their citizens who seek to send funds to the Islamic State.
Those commitments “can change facts on the ground in ways that airstrikes will not do,” said James Stavridis, a former Navy admiral who served as supreme allied commander in Europe and now heads the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.
“The real value will be in what ultimately hits the table.
On May 23rd, 1889, the trial of the Electric Sugar Refinery miscreants began in a Manhattan courtroom.
All of the defendants were there; Olive E.
William Howard and his wife Emily, as well as two brothers, George and Orrin Halstead, who were arrested in Michigan.
Assistant District Attorney Davis had them all gathered, but this was the trial of William Howard only.
He was seen as the head conspirator, after the now deceased Professor Friend, Olive’s husband.
They were on trial for a massive operation of fraud, larceny and deception all originating from the acceptance of investment money for an enterprise called the Electric Sugar Refining Company.
The New York and London stock markets had been abuzz for over a year over Professor Friend’s claim of inventing a new process of converting raw sugar into refined sugar through the use of his secret formula involving the use of electricity.
Had it worked, the process would have cut the time consuming and difficult process of refining sugar down to hours from days, saving refiners a boatload of money in processing and worker’s costs.
Had it worked, it would have made its inventor and his board of directors filthy rich.
The company would have also made the initial investors and stockholders quite wealthy too.
But then the Professor died in 1888, and the whole thing fell apart, and was exposed as a massive fraud and a swindle that would make any grifter proud.
For more details on the whole story, please read Part One, Part Two and Part Three.
All of the defendants sat in the courtroom that day.
Olive Friend, the wife of the deceased Professor, was much younger than her husband had been, and was a plump woman who said she suffered from heart palpitations.
She sat in the courtroom in black silk widow’s weeds with diamond earrings glittering from her ears.
Also at the table, the defendant William Howard, Olive’s step-father, sat with his arm propped up on the table, his hand cupped around his ear so he could catch every word of testimony.
Still dressed in his clerical collar and suit, he looked like a fierce Calvinist elder, despite his years, still ready to go forth in the ultimate battle for his freedom.
Military action against the Islamic terrorist network ISIS began late Monday night in the northern region of Syria, according to multiple news reports.
-led airstrikes in Syria started in the evening, Obama administration officials confirmed to Fox.
was joined in the airstrikes by five other Arab countries, Fox reported.
The named by Fox were Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Jordan and Qatar.
No European allies are reported to be involved in this initial strike, according to Fox News.
Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin said that it is estimated that “upwards of 20 to 25″ targets will be hit in the near future.
The Pentagon’s statement confirming the military activity via Sam Stein of the Huffington Post: Fox News Pentagon correspondent Justin Fishel repots that the intended targets of the airstrikes are “command/control centers, training camps and weapons depots.
Peter King (R-NY) said on Fox News shortly after news broke of the airstrikes that it’s “really important” for the U.
to support President Barack Obama “until ISIS has been devastated.
” NBC’s Luke Russert reported that House Speaker John Boehner was in touch with Obama earlier in the evening regarding the airstrikes.
Fox News aired what it claimed was amateur footage of the initial U.
-led military airstrikes against the Islamic terrorist group ISIS in Syria.

100 Million Thank-Yous to HuffPosters Around the World This morning I sent an email to our HuffPost team, sharing the news of a major milestone for our company -- one that really struck a chord with me.
And you, the members of the HuffPost community, are the heart and soul of this milestone.
Whether you have blogged on HuffPost, commented on, shared or talked about a story or just made us a regular part of your media diet, you have been a key part of the conversation we set out to start a little over nine years ago.
Indeed, without you, there would be no HuffPost.

I have not yet seen "42" but I'm giving it an enthusiastic thumbs-up.
If I had ten thumbs I would give it ten thumbs-up, because I want everyone to see the movie -- especially young people, a shocking number of whom don't know who Jackie Robinson was.
42, of course, was the uniform number (now retired throughout the major leagues) that Robinson donned when he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947 and slid swiftly, aggressively and gracefully into cultural history, just as he slid into countless bases under the tags of frustrated opponents.
"42" tells the story of his groundbreaking rookie-of-the-year season and, presumably, its antecedents: the decision of Dodger executive Branch Rickey (played by Harrison Ford) to break the unwritten taboo and sign an African-American player; the Mahatma's (as Rickey was called by the sporting press) wise choice of Robinson for the daunting assignment; Jackie's agreement to forswear retaliation and keep his cool in the face of the inevitable backlash.
I hope the movie tells the story well.
I hope it is faithful to the truth.
I hope it does justice to the drama, the tension, the ferocity of the resistance to integrating the national pastime, the pain endured by Jackie and his wife Rachel (an unsung hero if ever there was one), the courage of the Robinsons and their allies, and the sweet joy of the ultimate triumph.
I hope it's a box office smash and wins many awards, because each person who sees the movie improves the odds that this vital episode in our epic racial saga won't be forgotten.
If the Rickey-Robinson experiment had not succeeded, the civil rights movement could not have unfolded as it did, when it did, the way it did.
No less an authority than Martin Luther King Jr.
It will seem bizarre to young people that there was a time when black ballplayers were barred from Major League Baseball.
I'm sure the historical context is made plain in the film, and the racism that was once taken for granted is depicted in all its mad absurdity.
What I hope is also depicted accurately is how much Jackie Robinson meant to ordinary Americans.
Not just baseball fans (even racists admired his skill and his find-a-way-to-win competitiveness), and not just African Americans, who embraced Jackie like a Moses leading the way to the promised land.
I mean average white Joes and Janes, the subway straphangers, the bleacherites, the fans watching Dodger games in saloons or in sweltering apartments without air-conditioning, the workers in factories and offices who listened on transistor radios, the first generation Italians, Irish and Jews who identified with the struggle to be accepted as a fellow citizen, and the right-minded people all over the country - many of whom rose above their own racial ignorance thanks to baseball - who cheered for the Dodgers because far more was riding on what Jackie did, and didn't do, than the outcome of a ballgame or a pennant race.
I was a toddler when Jackie played his first season in hallowed Ebbets Field, but I grew up hearing about his struggle the way some kids grew up hearing about the Civil War or the Passion of Christ.
I became a Dodger-cap-wearing, mitt-pounding, box-score-reading fanatic in time to have my little heart broken every October when the team came up inches shy of World Series deliverance.
The Bums were my heroes, and Jackie was the hero of heroes, because grown men got teary-eyed when they talked about him and women who didn't know a home run from a field goal invoked him when arguing about bigotry or social justice.
Even at age eight I sensed that the annual Brooklyn cry of "Wait Til Next Year" held some kind of cosmic significance and was linked to my country's destiny.
I was in grade school when, one year after Brown vs.
Board of Education, the Dodgers finally broke the jinx and achieved redemption.
That victory over the hated Yankees had such an impact on me that I wrote a novel about it 37 years later.
Jackie had a belly by then, and he had lost a step or two.
He played third base most of that year, 1955, instead of second, and an injury kept him out of the lineup in the deciding game of the World Series, when the karmic winds of baseball finally blew toward Brooklyn.
But we knew, in our delirious joy, that the victory belonged above all to number 42.
Go see "42," and take a child with you.
Caplan syndrome is caused by breathing in coal mining dust.
This causes inflammation and can lead to the development of many small lung lumps (nodules) and mild asthma-like airway disease.
Some people who have been exposed to the dust have severe lung scarring that makes it difficult for their lungs to carry oxygen to the bloodstream (called progressive massive fibrosis).
People with rheumatoid arthritis do not seem more likely to have this complication of scarring.
Caplan syndrome is very rare in the United States.
Patients can reduce the risk for a second heart attack by following secondary prevention measures.
No one should be discharged from the hospital with these issues being addressed and appropriate medications prescribed.
Lifestyle choices, particularly dietary factors, are equally important in preventing heart attacks and must be strenuously adhered to.
Aim for a blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg.
LDL (“bad”) cholesterol should be substantially less than 100 mg/dL.
If triglycerides are greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL, then non-HDL-C should be less than 130 mg/dL.
Nearly all patients who have had a heart attack should receive a prescription for a statin drug before being discharged from the hospital.
It is also important to control dietary cholesterol by reducing intake of saturated fats to less than 7% of total calories.
Increased omega-3 fatty acid consumption (by eating more fish or taking fish oil supplements) can help reduce triglyceride levels.
Exercise for 30 - 60 minutes 7 days a week (or at least a minimum of 5 days a week.
Combine exercise with a healthy diet rich in fresh fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products.
Your body mass index (BMI) should be 18.
Waist circumference is also an important measure of heart attack risk.
Men’s waist circumferences should be fewer than 40 inches (102 centimeters) and women’s should be fewer than 35 inches (89 centimeters).
It is essential to stop smoking.
Also, avoid exposure to second-hand smoke.
Your doctor may recommend you take aspirin (75 - 81 mg) on a daily basis.
If you have had a drug-coated stent inserted, you must take clopidogrel (Plavix) along with aspirin for at least 1 year following surgery.
(Aspirin is also recommended for some patients as primary prevention of heart attack.
Your doctor may recommend that you take an ACE inhibitor or beta blocker drug on an ongoing basis.
It is also important to have an annual influenza (“flu”) vaccination.
From Capital New York: Councilman Dan Garodnick and Council speaker Christine Quinn will not vote in favor of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's plan to allow taller buildings around Grand Central Terminal.
That means that the controversial proposal to rezone some 73 blocks in Midtown East is now, effectively, dead.
“Creating new jobs in East Midtown—and across all of New York City—is essential," said the councilmembers in a joint statement just emailed to reporters.
"We can and should do more with the commercial corridor around Grand Central.
However, a good idea alone is not enough to justify action today.
We should rezone East Midtown, but only when we can do so properly.
After extensive negotiations, we have been unable to reach agreement on a number of issues in the proposed plan.
" The real estate industry and Bloomberg administration have argued that the office space in Midtown East is outdated and increasingly unappealing to modern tenants.
In order for New York City to retain its status as a world-class city in an increasingly global economy, the city must allow for more modern office skyscrapers around Grand Central, the argument goes.
Most of the proposed rezoning falls within Garodnick's district, and since the Council typically refers to the local member in land use decisions, his support, or lack thereof, is considered decisive.
In a statement, mayor-elect Bill de Blasio applauded the councilmembers, "for pressing the pause button in order to ensure these concerns are adequately addressed.
We must continue this process in earnest upon taking office, and I commit to presenting a revised rezoning plan for the area by the end of 2014.
A combination of its drugs slightly improved lung function of patients with the genetic disease in trials closely watched by Wall Street.
The data suggested that Vertex could have a multibillion-dollar franchise in treating cystic fibrosis, a life-threatening genetic disorder that affects about 70,000 people worldwide.
The Food and Drug Administration called Kalydeco a “breakthrough therapy” because it treats the underlying cause of the genetic disease, rather than just the symptoms.

As Brooklyn social worker and performer Imani Henry points out, and as most of us are seeing first hand, “rents are increasing while incomes are decreasing.
” In a recent article in The Guardian, Chris Toenes, a social worker who supports Henry's program, relates an anecdote about an older man who is astonished to find out that the old African American neighborhood of Braggtown, North Carolina, has now been rechristened as “Colonial Heights”, by developers hoping to attract a more well-to-do class of residents.
The neighborhood’s new name, of course, betrays an ominous significance.
Gentrification is completely out of hand, not only in New York and San Francisco, but in cities large and small all across the country.
Is it a vast social engineering project, or merely a confluence of many and disparate forces such as real estate speculation, privatization of resources, the weakening of unions, globalization, political corruption, etc.
But the important thing is to fight back on a local level in whatever small way we can.
To this end, Henry has developed a web-based art project called “Before it’s Gone—Take it Back”, to have residents document neighborhood life in Brooklyn—“weddings, backyard barbecues, quinceaneras, bar/bat mitzvahs,” etc.
—and to tie it to the history of their neighborhoods.
It’s important to connect what’s happening today to the history of a place, because history is one of the main things that these developers want to expunge—or rather, to sanitize in order to present their own more palatable, squeaky-clean vanilla version of the past.
Such an whitewash makes it that much easier to ignore the cries of the working and middle class people that gentrification displaces.
Help Imani Henry thwart the developers Orwellian intentions.
To learn more about his project, to perhaps kick in a few dollars, send a selfie, or even to be inspired to start your own local project, go to "Before it's Gone - Take it Back".

By Mitch Broder Why did the Town Shop cross the road.
Especially since the other size is three times the previous size.
Town Shop is the store where women undress you with their eyes — at least if you’re also a woman, and in search of the right brassiere.
It’s the bra-fitting capital of New York, and it has just moved across the street to a shop that can provide more women than ever with its formidable support.
This is fitting, since Town Shop has always been preoccupied with size.
It advances the theory that 80 percent of women are afflicted with ill-fitting bras.
When a member of that 80 percent walks in, a fitter quickly looks her over and then announces her proper number and letter.
There’s not a tape measure in the house.
But the once-over measure must work, since the store is around a century old, with roots in a Bleecker Street notions shop of 1888.
It has had several branches around the city, but this is the one that endured.
It’s been a fixture on the Upper West Side since 1936.
For most of its life it was run by Selma Koch, the founder’s daughter-in-law, who arguably became even more famous than her bras.
Her crusty devotion made her a media darling.
She ruled the store for 75 years.
She was undoubtedly as famous as you could get and still be a bra-store owner.
Selma died 10 years ago, and the store has since been run by her son and grandson, Peter Koch and Danny Koch.
Schooled as they are in spatial relationships, they were primed to increase their square footage.
When a chance appeared across the street, they packed up their underthings.
The bright new space, Danny says, is a jolt to some longtime patrons: “They say, ‘Oh, we loved that old store’ or ‘We miss the intimate feel.
’” But others are jolted with joy.
“They can’t believe this is us,” Danny says.
“They’re not accustomed to shopping in one of our stores where you can actually see the merchandise.
” The merchandise, as always, includes all manner of ladies’ delicates.
But now it also includes a whole department of gentlemen’s delicates.
The Koches tested the waters two years ago with the Spanx line of “compression” undershirts, and their new store has expanded it into an entire man’s room.
Along with the Spanx compressors, the room displays underwear and pajamas with fancy-pants brand names like Calida and Derek Rose.
As Danny points out, women buy most men’s underwear, but just in case, the man’s room has a TV set that always shows the game.
Danny loves his new place — but he made sure to give it some old spirit.
You can see it in things like the dressing-room curtains and the Town Shop memorabilia.
The store is shiny, but it’s still a long way from Bloomingdale’s.
Or in Danny’s words: “It’s somewhere between what we had and the Apple Store.
” Cross over to Town Shop, now at 2270 Broadway, between 81st and 82nd streets, in New York City.

In the tradition of Cormac McCarthy and Flannery O'Connor, Cheng's literary debut explores the bonds between three childhood friends that are upended by the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.
