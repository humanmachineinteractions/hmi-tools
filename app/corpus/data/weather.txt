COLD FRONT PASSAGE TODAY WILL USHER IN SEASONABLY COOL TEMPERATURES FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.  


COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO MAKE ITS TREK TO THE EAST EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. WITH VERY LITTLE MOISTURE REMAINING...THERE HAVE BEEN VERY FEW NOTABLE RETURNS ON THE RADAR. HOWEVER...WILL AT LEAST MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER OR TWO ALONG THE RIDGES AS THE FRONT CROSSES.  MID LEVEL MOISTURE AND STRATOCUMULUS DECK IS STRUGGLING TO MAKE ITS WAY SOUTH AS THE UPPER TROUGH PIVOTS ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. THIS IS DUE TO MIXING OF DRY AIR TO THE SURFACE. THUS...HAVE DECREASED CLOUD COVER THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. EXTENT IN CLOUD COVER...IS IT FINALLY MAKES IT HERE... FINALLY WILL HAVE IMPACT ON OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES. FOR NOW...THEY WERE CONSTRUCTED AROUND MAV GUIDANCE WHICH IS ABOUT 5 TO 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL.  
TEMPERATURES ABOUT 5 TO 10 DEGREES BELOW THE AVERAGES ARE PROJECTED TO PERSIST FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SHORT TERM PERIOD. FEW CHANGES WERE NEEDED FOR THE ONGOING TEMPERATURE FORECAST...BUT TWEAKS WERE BASED ON THE LATEST ADJUSTED MET AND GFS MOS TRENDS.  MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE SHORT TERM PERIOD WERE IN THE FORM OF PRECIP PROBABILITY ADDITIONS...ALBEIT SLIGHT TO LOW END CHANCE NUMBERS...AS GFS AND NAM CONT TO GENERATE SOME LIGHT PRECIP OVER AREAS SOUTH OF I 80 WITH A RAPIDLY CROSSING SHORTWAVE IN THE PREDAWN OF THURSDAY. PROGGED MOISTURE PROFILES DO NOT INDICATE A SATURATED COLUMN...HENCE ANY SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LIGHT AND MAY NOT EXCEED THE SPRINKLE CATEGORY. MINIMAL POP NUMBERS WILL SUFFICE FOR NOW...BUT WERE NOT EXTENDED TO THE MOISTURE STARVED REINFORCING FRONT PROJECTED FOR FRIDAY ENCROACHMENT.  
SURFACE RIDGING BUILDING UNDER A DEPARTING BROAD UPPER EAST COAST TROUGH SHOULD BRING DRY WEATHER THROUGH AT LEAST EARLY SUNDAY. A SLOWLY ADVANCING PLAINS AND MIDWEST TROUGH IS PROGGED TO BRING INCREASING SHOWER CHANCES BY LATE SUNDAY INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. MODELS DIFFER ON THE STRENGTH OF UPPER RIDGING AHEAD OF THAT APPROACHING TROUGH...SO WENT NO HIGHER THAN CHANCE POPS USING DOWNWARD TWEAKED WPC ENSEMBLE BASED GUIDANCE.  A GRADUAL INCREASE IN TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED EACH DAY USING WPC ENSEMBLE BASED GUIDANCE.  
MD...NONE. OH...NONE. PA...NONE. WV...NONE.  
A COLD FRONT CROSSES THE LOCAL AREA THIS AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE SLOW TO BUILD INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  
A WEAK BACKDOOR FRONT REMAINS IN PLACE OVER THE EASTERN SHORE... WHILE A COLD FRONT IS APPROACHING THE MOUNTAINS. THAT COLD FRONT WILL REACH THE PIEDMONT BY EARLY AFTN...THEN PUSHES ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF THE FA INTO THE EVE. THE COMBINATION OF DAYTIME HEATING...MARGINAL INSTABILITY AND LINGERING CONVECTIVE BOUNDARIES MAY RESULT IN ISOLD/SCT CONVECTION MIDDAY/EARLY AFTN PRE-COLD FRONT. THE PRIMARY AREA OF POSSIBLE MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTION LATER TODAY IS EXPECTED TO BE E OF I95...ESPECIALLY IN SE VA/NE NC. WARM AND HUMID AGAIN TODAY. HIGH TEMPS FROM THE MID 80S TO AROUND 90F (EXCEPT COOLER AT THE IMMEDIATE COAST).  
CDFNT SETTLES E AND S OF THE FA (EARLY) TNGT. HAVE MAINTAINED 30-50% POPS TO SE VA/NE NC THROUGH ABT 04Z/20. CLEARING OUT POST CDFNT FM NW TO SE...W/ SOME LWRG OF DEWPTS. LO TEMPS IN THE 60S.  COOLER/DRY SFC HI PRES BEGINS TO BUILD TOWARD THE AREA FROM THE WNW WED...YIELDING A DRIER/MORE COMFORTABLE DAY WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE. HIGH TEMPS FROM THE MID 70S NORTH TO THE LOW 80S SOUTH. COMFORTABLE WED NIGHT WITH LOWS IN THE MID 50S TO LOW 60S. SHORTWAVE ENERGY DIVES SOUTH INTO THE CAROLINAS ON THURSDAY WITH WEAK SFC LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPING ALONG A STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVR THE SE CONUS STATES. MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL GET SHOVED NORTHWARD INTO THE LOCAL AREA...ESPECIALLY IN THE AFTN/EVE. WILL KEEP CHC POPS FOR MUCH OF THE AREA. COOL AGN THU...W/ MOST HI TEMPS IN THE L70S.  
MEDIUM RANGE BEGINS WITH LATEST GFS/ECMWF INTO GOOD AGREEMENT WITH WEAK UPPER TROUGH AXIS CROSSING THE REGION THU NIGHT...AND SFC LOW PRESSURE SLIDING OFF THE COAST. WILL MAINTAIN LOW CHC POPS THU NIGHT...AND SLIGHT CHC POPS THROUGH FRI MORNING IN THE FAR SE. OTHERWISE. HIGH PRESSURE THEN GRADUALLY BUILDS ESE FROM THE UPPER MIDWEST FRI-SAT...AND SLIDES OFF THE COAST ON SUN. THIS WILL RESULT IN DRY CONDITIONS WITH COOLER TEMPERATURES FRI/SAT...PARTICULARLY AT THE COAST ON SAT AS THE STRENGTH OF THE HIGH IS FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE...1030 MB+ AND ONSHORE FLOW INCREASES IN THE AFTN AS A PIECE OF THE HIGH BECOMES CENTERED JUST OFFSHORE. SKIES WILL AVG MOSTLY SUNNY BOTH DAYS ASIDE FROM SOME LINGERING CLOUDS FRI MORNING. HIGHS FRI WILL BE FROM 75-80 F INLAND...TO 70-75 F NEAR THE COAST...TRENDING DOWN TO THE MID 70S SAT INLAND TO ONLY THE UPPER 60S/LOWER 70S AT THE COAST. LOWS WILL GENLY RANGE THROUGH THE 50S SAT AND SUN MORNING. FLOW TURNS AROUND TO THE SSW SUN/MON AS SFC HIGH PUSHES WELL OFFSHORE AND UPPER RIDGE AXIS MOVES BACK INTO THE REGION. HIGHS WARM BACK INTO THE LWR 80S INLAND ON SUN...AND 85-90 F BY MON. CONDITIONS BOTH DAYS WILL BE ABOUT 5 DEGREES COOLER AT THE COAST. WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY THROUGH MIDDAY MON...THEN CARRY 20-30% POPS ACRS THE NORTH BY MON AFTN.  
WILL MAINTAIN MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS AT ALL TAF SITES THRU THE 06Z TAF PERIOD. ALTHO...EXPECT MVFR AND EVEN IFR CONDITIONS AT SBY THRU EARLY THIS MORNG...DUE TO AREA OF SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A TSTM MOVNG THRU. OTHERWISE...WILL HAVE A VCSH AT OTHER TAF SITES DUE TO CURRENT ACTIVITY ON RADAR...AND LINGERING INSTABILITY/BOUNDARIES WITH SURFACE TROF CROSSING THE REGION.  CONTINUED CHCS FOR SHOWERS/TSTMS DURING TODAY...AS A COLD FRONT APPROACHES AND MOVES ACRS THE AREA. FOR NOW...HAVE A VCSH STARTING AT 16Z-18Z AT THE TAF SITES AND CONTINUING INTO EARLY THIS EVENG.  FRONT PUSHES OFF THE CST TNGT INTO WED MORNG...WITH NORTHERLY WINDS BEHIND THE BOUNDARY USHERING DRIER AIR INTO THE REGION. VFR CONDITIONS THEN EXPECTED THRU WED...AS HI PRES BLDS INTO THE AREA. NEXT THREAT FOR SHOWERS/TSTMS WILL BE THU...AS A SHRTWV TROF MOVES ACRS THE REGION.  
WEAK SFC TROF MOVNG THRU THE CHES BAY AND CSTL WTRS EARLY THIS MORNG...WILL PUSH OFFSHR DURING THIS MORNG. LIGHT ONSHR FLO 10 KT OR LESS...WILL BECOME SW OR W. A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH ACRS THE WTRS THIS EVENG INTO TNGT...WITH WINDS BECOMING N-NW POST-FRONTAL. NOT A REAL STRONG COLD FRONT...BUT DOES APPEAR TO BE SUFFICIENT COOL AIR SURGE TO LEAD TO LOW END SCA CONDITIONS FOR THE CHES BAY. SO...HAVE ISSUED A SCA FOR THE ENTIRE CHES BAY FM LATE TNGT THRU WED MORNG FOR ZNS 630>632...AND FM EARLY WED MORNG THRU EARLY WED AFTN FOR ZN 634. AT THIS TIME...HAVE KEPT CONDS BELOW SCA FOR THE RIVERS/SND/OCEAN. SFC HI PRES BLDS INTO THE REGION FM THE W WED NGT...WITH A WEAK LO PRES SYSTEM PASSING BY TO THE S ON THU. SOME UNCERTAINTY ON EXACT TRACK OF THIS SYSTEM. FOR NOW...MODELS KEEP WINDS FAIRLY LIGHT...10-15 KT AT MOST ALTHO THIS COULD CHANGE. HI PRES THEN BLDS OVER THE AREA FRI AFTN-SUN...FAIRLY COOL AIRMASS INITIALLY WILL LIKELY BRING SOME INCREASE IN WINDS FRI INTO SAT.  
NWR SALISBURY MD HAS RETURNED TO SERVICE.  
MD...NONE. NC...NONE. VA...NONE. MARINE...SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FROM 6 AM TO 1 PM EDT WEDNESDAY FOR      ANZ634.      SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FROM 4 AM TO 10 AM EDT WEDNESDAY FOR      ANZ630>632.  
A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA TODAY. BEHIND THE FRONT A COOLER AND DRIER AIR MASS WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. A WEAK SYSTEM MAY THEN BRING SOME RAIN BACK TO THE REGION THURSDAY.  
SFC CDFNT APPROACHING FM THE OHVLY. IN ADDITION BACKDOOR FNT STILL APPEARS TO BE PRESENT IN THE PRES/THERMAL PTTN ACRS NE MD /DCA T/TD 78/69 VS PHL T/TD 65/60/.  SYNOP FLOW TDA WL LARGELY BE FROM THE WEST...WHICH WL ADVECT A DRIER AMS EWD. THE MORE LMTD MSTR PROFILE WL MAKE CNVCTV INITIATION MORE PROBLEMATIC. SHEAR PROFILE MINIMAL...AND MEAN LYR CAPE ONLY 600-700 J/KG. ULTIMATELY THE MAXT WL DICTATE AMT IN STABILITY...BUT WITH LACK OF SHEAR AND WLY FLOW...DONT THINK TSRA WL BE A BIG DEAL TAFTN. BEST OPPORTUNITY WL COME ELY IN THE AFTN...BEFORE MSTR JUST BECOMES TOO LMTD. HV SCALED BACK LATE DAY CLOUD COVER AND ADJUSTED MAXT...SPCLY IN THE MTNS.  
HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE PLAINS WILL BUILD EAST BEHIND THE COLD FRONT TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...WITH NORTHWESTERLY FLOW AT THE SURFACE BRINGING IN A SURGE OF COOLER...AND IN PARTICULAR...LESS HUMID AIR TO OUR REGION. LOWS TUESDAY NIGHT ARE EXPECTED TO BE 10-15 DEGREES COOLER THAN MONDAY NIGHT`S WERE AND HIGHS WEDNESDAY SHOULD BE SIMILARLY LOWER AS COMPARED TO TODAY`S EXPECTED HIGHS. COMBINED WITH THE LACK OF HUMIDITY...IT WILL FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE. SUNSHINE WILL DOMINATE WEDNESDAY AS WELL...THOUGH HIGH COULDS AHEAD OF ANOTHER DISTURBANCE APPROACHING FROM THE WEST MAY START MOVING IN TOWARDS DAY`S END.  
FOR THE PERIOD WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...THERE IS STILL NOT SUPERB AGREEMENT ABOUT HOW A NORTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL INTERACT WITH SFC LOW PRESSURE MOVING THROUGH THE CAROLINAS. WITH THE 00Z GUIDANCE SUITE...THE GFS IS MORE OF AN OUTLIER WITH A DRIER SOLUTION. INCREASED POPS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN CWA WHERE THERE IS GREATER AGREEMENT ON THE POTENTIAL FOR SHOWERS. START/END OF PRECIP IS MOST IN QUESTION...ALTHOUGH THE PROBABILITY OF THUNDER IS LOW. THURSDAY WILL BE COOL AND CLOUDY REGARDLESS OF THE SOLUTION...WITH HIGH TEMPS ONLY IN THE UPPER 60S TO AROUND 70.  UPPER LEVEL TROUGHING WILL ENVELOP THE EASTERN CONUS FOR THE END OF THE WEEK AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE MS AND OH VALLEYS. TEMPS WILL REBOUND TO NEAR-NORMAL VALUES. THE HIGH WILL BEGIN TO MOVE OFFSHORE ON SUNDAY AND A WARM FRONT WILL LIFT NORTH THROUGH THE OH VALLEY. LOW CHANCE OF SHOWERS MAINLY IN NORTHERN AREAS ON SUNDAY WITH THIS FEATURE. BY MONDAY...UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL BUILD. WARMER AND MORE HUMID CONDITIONS WILL LIKELY RETURN WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.  
THUNDERSTORMS MAY DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON...BUT SHOULD BE RATHER HIT-OR-MISS. AT THE MOMENT...BEST ODDS APPEAR TO BE ELY-MID AFTERNOON SO HAVE INCLUDED VCTS DURING THIS PERIOD. WINDS SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY BELOW 15 KNOTS...SHIFTING TO THE WEST AND NORTHWEST. NO AVIATION CONCERNS ON WEDNESDAY THOUGH WINDS WILL BE A BIT GUSTY FROM THE NORTHWEST.  DEPENDING ON THE TRACK OF LOW PRESSURE TO OUR SOUTH...SUB-VFR CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE ON THURSDAY IN LOW CLOUDS AND SHOWERS. THE PROBABILITY IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER AT CHO. OTHERWISE NO WIDESPREAD AVIATION ISSUES ARE EXPECTED IN THE OUTLOOK PERIOD.  
A FEW THUNDERSTORMS PSBL TAFTN..BUT DRY AIR INFILTRATING FROM THE WEST WL MAKE INITIATION INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT. BEHIND THE COLD FRONT...THE PRESSURE GRADIENT IS TIGHT ENOUGH SUCH THAT WINDS HAVE A GOOD SHOT AT GUSTING UP TO 20 KNOTS TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR THIS.  LOW PRESSURE WILL PASS THROUGH THE CAROLINAS AND OFFSHORE FROM WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. DEPENDING ON ITS TRACK...WINDS MAY APPROACH SCA LEVELS OVER MAINLY SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE MD BAY/LOWER POTOMAC. SHOWERS ARE ALSO POSSIBLE. NORTHERLY CHANNELING MAY OCCUR ON FRIDAY...BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW ON ABILITY TO REACH SCA LEVELS.  
DC...NONE. MD...NONE. VA...NONE. WV...NONE. MARINE...SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FROM 5 AM TO 5 PM EDT WEDNESDAY FOR      ANZ530>543.  
A FRONT WILL CROSS THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY REGION THIS MORNING AND USHER IN SEASONABLY COOL TEMPERATURES FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.  
MID MORNING UPDATE WAS MADE TO ADJUST CLOUD COVER AND DIURNAL TEMPERATUTES. OTHERWISE FORECAST REMAINS ON TRACK AS COLD FRONT IS ALREADY CROSSING A LINE FROM DUJ TO PIT TO HLG  PREVIOUS... UPPER OHIO VALLEY AIRSPACE INITIALLY SHOULD BEGIN TO CLEAR OUT WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE LATER THIS MORNING...BUT ADDITIONAL CLOUDS IN THE FORM OF STRATOUCU ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE BACK IN FROM THE NORTHWEST AS COLD ADVECTION ENSUES IN EARNEST THIS AFTERNOON.  NEAR TERM TEMP ADJUSTMENTS WERE MINIMAL...BUT BASED ON NWS COLLABORATION AND A BLEND OF NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE.  
A COLD FRONT APPROACHING WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA WILL PASS THROUGH OUR FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE WILL FOLLOW FOR WEDNESDAY. LOW PRESSURE ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST LATE THURSDAY SHOULD MOVE OUT TO SEA BY FRIDAY. ANOTHER COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO ARRIVE FROM THE NORTHWEST FRIDAY AFTERNOON WITH STRONGER HIGH PRESSURE MOVING TO THE MID ATLANTIC COAST THIS WEEKEND. A WARM FRONT MAY APPROACH FROM THE SOUTHWEST FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY.  
SO THE BACKDOOR FRONT THAT PUSHED SOUTH AND WEST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA YESTERDAY IS HANGING OUT ACROSS THE DELMARVA EARLY THIS MORNING. THIS FRONT IS EXPECTED TO LIFT BACK NORTH ACROSS THE COASTAL PLAIN DURING THE DAY.  THE COLD FRONT TO OUR WEST ISN`T IN ANY HURRY AND PROBABLY WON`T MAKE IT OFF THE COAST UNTIL SOME TIME THIS EVENING. THE EARLIER THINKING WAS THIS AFTERNOON.  THE FOG AND LOW CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO LESSEN OR DISSIPATE AS THE DAYS PROGRESSES, BUT THE ASSUMPTION IS IMPROVEMENT WILL COMMENCE DOWN SOUTH FIRST AND UP NORTH LAST. IMPROVEMENT SHOULD COINCIDE WITH THE WARM FRONT AND IT`S MIGRATION TO THE NORTH. THE HRRR SHOWS WINDS BECOMING WEST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 1/2 OF THE CWA BY AROUND 15Z, BUT NOT AROUND 18-19Z ACROSS THE NORTHEAST COASTAL ZONES.  THE ENTIRE AREA SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO EXPERIENCE THESE WESTERLY WINDS, BUT IF THIS DOESN`T MATERIALIZE FOR EVERYONE, FORECAST TEMPERATURES WILL BE TOO HIGH FOR PLACES LIKE MONMOUTH COUNTY.  THE GFS ISN`T SHOWING DEEP LAYER MOISTURE TODAY AND THE BEST INSTABILITY AND SYNOPTIC LIFT/FLOW ARE DECOUPLED. THE BEST SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY SHOULD RESIDE ACROSS THE DELMARVA THIS AFTERNOON WHILE THE BEST OVERALL LIFT/DYNAMICS/FLOW WILL BE ACROSS THE NORTH.  WITH THAT SAID, WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THE IDEA THAT OVERALL CONVECTIVE ORGANIZATION WILL BE ON THE LOWER END AS THE DAY WEARS ON. STILL, WITH SOME DRY AIR ALOFT, WE COULD SEE SOME DECENT GUSTS IF THIS AFTERNOON`S THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOP ENOUGH TO TAP INTO THAT LAYER.  AS FOR THE HIGH TEMPERATURES, WE USED MOSTLY AN EVEN BLEND OF THE GFS/NAM MOS.  
AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS FORECAST TO START SHARPENING UP ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN CANADA AND INTO THE NORTHEAST LATER TONIGHT. THIS WILL DRIVE A COLD FRONT OFFSHORE THIS EVENING AND ANY LINGERING CONVECTION WILL EITHER DISSIPATE OR MOVE OUT TO SEA. AS A RESULT, KEPT A MENTION IN FOR A TIME IN THE EVENING BUT QUICKLY TAPER THE POPS DOWN FROM WEST TO EAST. FOLLOWING THE COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE, CAA BEGINS TO OVERTAKE THE AREA THROUGH THE NIGHT.  THE PRESSURE GRADIENT SHOULD TIGHTEN SOME THROUGH THE NIGHT AS LOW PRESSURE TRACKS NORTH OF MAINE AND HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. THIS ALONG WITH SOME CAA SHOULD PROMOTE SOME MIXING THROUGH THE NIGHT AND THEREFORE AT LEAST SOME WIND AT THE SURFACE. THE AIRMASS IS DRYING QUITE A BIT THEREFORE OTHER THAN SOME STRATOCUMULUS ACROSS THE NORTHWEST ZONES, MOST AREAS SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR OR MOSTLY CLEAR SKY.  AS FOR THE LOW TEMPERATURES, WE USED A NAM/GFS MOS BLEND WITH SOME TWEAKS.  
500MB: CONFLUENT WESTERLY FLOW OVERHEAD TO START WEDNESDAY WITH THE NORTHERN BRANCH SLIPPING SOUTHWARD AND BECOMING DOMINANT WITH ITS SHORT WAVE PASSAGE FRIDAY AND COOLER THAN NORMAL HEIGHTS. A VERY WARM RIDGE DEVELOPS ALONG THE EAST COAST SUNDAY THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK.  TEMPERATURES: THE FIRST 18 DAYS HAVE AVERAGED AROUND 7 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. CALENDAR DAY AVERAGES WILL BE BELOW NORMAL WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY WITH GREATEST NEGATIVE DEPARTURES ALMOST 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL ON SATURDAY. (AND POSSIBLY THURSDAY IF IT RAINS). CONSIDERABLE WARMING SHOULD BEGIN AROUND MEMORIAL DAY OR IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER.  LONG TERM HAZARDS: LOW PROBABILITY POSSIBLE COUNTRYSIDE SPOTTY TOUCH OF FROST N OF I-78 THURSDAY MORNING OR MAYBE A SLIGHTLY GREATER CHANCE SATURDAY MORNING?  FORECAST BASIS: UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, A 50 50 BLEND 00Z/19 GFS/NAM MOS GUIDANCE WEDNESDAY - THURSDAY, 00Z/19 MEX MOS THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY, THEN THE 0521Z/19 WPC GRIDDED ELEMENTS OF MAX/MIN TEMP, 12 HOUR POP, 6 HOUR DEWPOINT-SKY-WIND FROM FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY.  THE DAILIES...  WEDNESDAY-WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WEAK HIGH PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW THE COLD FRONT AND IT SHOULD BRING DRY WEATHER CONDITIONS AND BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES OVERALL (DIURNAL CU WED AFTERNOON AND THEN SOME HIGH CLOUDINESS IS POSSIBLE LATE WED NIGHT). WINDS WEDNESDAY NORTHWEST GUSTY 15-20 MPH.  NEARLY CALM AT NIGHT. TEMPERATURES MAY FALL INTO THE UPPER 30S IN PARTS OF THE POCONOS REGION AND NORTHWESTERN NEW JERSEY EARLY ON THURSDAY MORNING IF THE HIGH CLOUD COVER DOES NOT ARRIVE PRIOR TO 09Z/21. IT COULD BE CLOSE FOR A TOUCH OF LOCALIZED FROST N OF I-78 IN TYPICALLY COLDEST SPOTS... WALPACK AND PEQUEST NJ AMONG OTHERS? CONFIDENCE: AVERAGE.   THURSDAY...PARTLY CLOUDY OR CONSIDERABLE CLOUDINESS WITH THE APPROACHING SHORT WAVE AND MODEL DEPENDENT. GENERALLY WEST OR NORTHWEST WIND GUSTS 15 MPH OR LESS. TEMPERATURES MAY BE FORECAST TOO WARM. THIS DEPENDENT ON SKYCOVER AND THE NORTHERN EXTENT OF THE RAIN SHIELD. SINCE THERE IS UNCERTAINTY, THERE IS ALSO BELOW NORMAL CONFIDENCE IN THE TEMPS AND PROBABILITY OF MEASURABLE RAIN. AT THIS TIME, THINK THIS THURSDAY FORECAST IS ON THE WARMER SIDE OF THE ENVELOPE OF SOLUTIONS.  FRIDAY...PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY WITH DIURNAL CU/SC IN THE AFTERNOON. WEST TO NORTHWEST WIND GUSTY 20 MPH BECOME NEARLY CALM LATE AT NIGHT. EC HAS -2C AT 850 MB DOWN TO ABOUT I-80. COULD BE A COUNTRYSIDE RISK OF SPOTTY FROST N OF I-80.  SATURDAY...LOOKS SUNNY! LIGHT WIND.  SUNDAY...INCREASING CLOUDS WITH WARM AIR ADVECTION.  SHOWERS POSSIBLE AT NIGHT?  MONDAY...WARMER WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS? UNCERTAINTY FOR MEMORIAL DAY AND ITS STILL POSSIBLE IT WILL BE RAINFREE. IT DOES APPEAR THAT WAA SHOWERS SHOULD OCCUR SOMETIME SUNDAY OR MONDAY. PLENTY OF TIME FOR MORE OPTIMISM IN THE MODEL GUIDANCE.  
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS FOR KPHL, KPNE, KTTN, KABE, KRDG, KILG, KMIV, KACY AND SURROUNDING AREAS.  TODAY...IFR/LIFR CEILINGS IMPROVING TO MVFR TOWARD LATE MORNING, THEN VFR DURING THE AFTERNOON AS A COLD FRONT APPROACHES. AFTER SOME LIFR FOG EARLIER THIS MORNING, MAINLY MVFR FOG WILL IMPROVE THROUGH THE MORNING. LIGHT EAST TO SOUTHEAST WINDS, TURNING TOWARDS THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST AROUND 10 KNOTS IN THE AFTERNOON. SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS /AFTERNOON/ ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT, HOWEVER THESE MAY BE MAINLY SCATTERED. LOWER CONFIDENCE ON THE TIMING OF IMPROVEMENT TO MVFR/VFR, AND ALSO SHOWER/THUNDER COVERAGE ESPECIALLY THIS AFTERNOON.  TONIGHT...A FEW SHOWERS OR A THUNDERSTORM EARLY, OTHERWISE VFR. WEST TO NORTHWEST WINDS MOSTLY 5-15 KNOTS.  OUTLOOK... WEDNESDAY...VFR.  SCT-BKN AOA 5000 FT. NORTHWEST GUSTY 15 TO 20 KT DURING THE DAY BECOME NEARLY CALM AT NIGHT.  THURSDAY...VFR.  SCT-BKN AOA 5000 FT.   GENERALLY WEST WIND GUST UNDER 15 KT. SMALL CHC OF SHOWERS PHL SEWD, ESPECIALLY S DE AND COASTAL SE NJ.  FRIDAY...VFR SCT-BKN AOA 5000 FT MAY BECOME COMPLETELY CLEAR NIGHT. WEST-NORTHWEST WIND GUSTY 20 KT SHOULD DIMINISH AT NIGHT.  SATURDAY...VFR NEARLY CLEAR.  LIGHT WIND.  
A LIGHT ONSHORE FLOW TO START TODAY WILL VEER TO SOUTH THEN TO SOUTHWEST AND WEST BY LATE AFTERNOON. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THIS EVENING WITH CAA DEVELOPING IN ITS WAKE. THE CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE BELOW SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CRITERIA TODAY INTO TONIGHT, HOWEVER THE CAA LATE TONIGHT AND MAINLY TOWARD DAYBREAK WEDNESDAY MAY ALLOW FOR WIND GUSTS TO NEAR 25 KNOTS. THIS LOOKS SHORT IN DURATION THOUGH IF IT WERE TO OCCUR. SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TODAY INTO TONIGHT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT.  OUTLOOK... WEDNESDAY...NO SCA HEADLINE ANTICIPATED AT THIS TIME. NW WIND GUSTS AROUND 20 KT DURING THE DAY DIMINISH AT NIGHT WITH STRONGEST DAYTIME WIND PROBABLY ALONG THE NEARSHORE WATERS.  THURSDAY....SCA NOT ANTICIPATED AT THIS TIME, THOUGHT KEEPING AN EYE ON THE NORTH CAROLINA SFC LOW.  FRIDAY....SMALL CHANCE OF SCA FOR NEARSHORE WEST TO NORTHWEST WIND GUSTS NEAR 25 KT DURING THE DAY DIMINISHING AT NIGHT.  SATURDAY...NO MARINE HEADLINE ANTICIPATED.  
WIND GUSTS SHOULD BE AROUND 20 MPH FROM THE NORTHWEST ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES MAY FALL TO NEAR 30 PERCENT ESPECIALLY IN PARTS OF EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW JERSEY.  FRIDAY AFTERNOON MAY BE SIMILAR TO WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.  
PA...NONE. NJ...NONE. DE...NONE. MD...NONE. MARINE...NONE.  
NO MAJOR CHANGES FOR THE DAWN UPDATE. PREVIOUS...RESIDUAL SHOWERS OVER AREAS EAST OF PITTSBURGH WILL CONTINUE TO DISSIPATE EARLY THIS MORNING AS THE COLD FRONT...BEST DEFINED VIA DEWPOINT DIFFERENTIAL...ADVANCES ACROSS OHIO.  UPPER OHIO VALLEY AIRSPACE INITIALLY SHOULD BEGIN TO CLEAR OUT WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE LATER THIS MORNING...BUT ADDITIONAL CLOUDS IN THE FORM OF STRATOUCU ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE BACK IN FROM THE NORTHWEST AS COLD ADVECTION ENSUES IN EARNEST THIS AFTERNOON.  NEAR TERM TEMP ADJUSTMENTS WERE MINIMAL...BUT BASED ON NWS COLLABORATION AND A BLEND OF NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE.  
A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA TODAY. A FEW MORE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE. BEHIND THE FRONT A COOLER AND DRIER AIR MASS WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. A WEAK SYSTEM MAY THEN BRING SOME RAIN BACK TO THE REGION THURSDAY.  
THE LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTED A BACK DOOR COLD FRONT SLIDING SOUTHWEST ACROSS MARYLAND...AND A MORE TYPICAL COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTH AND WEST ACROSS THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES...OHIO VALLEY...MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...AND SOUTHERN PLAINS. THE BACK DOOR FRONT IS EXPECTED TO STALL OUT...WHILE THE FRONT TO THE WEST SHOULD CONTINUE MOVING EASTWARD TODAY. THIS FRONT WILL ARRIVE IN THE CWA EARLY THIS AFTERNOON AND CLEAR THE CWA LATE IN THE DAY. HOWEVER...IT APPEARS THE BEST UPPER LEVEL FORCING IS ACTUALLY CROSSING THE AREA EARLIER IN THE DAY...AS SUGGESTED BY THE ONGOING SHOWER ACTIVITY IN WESTERN AND NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA. THUS...IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE ODDS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE LOWER TODAY THAN THEY WERE YESTERDAY...BUT STILL EXPECT SOME SCATTERED SHOWER ACTIVITY THIS MORNING AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE ACTUAL FRONT. HIGHS WILL REMAIN VERY WARM PARTICULARLY SOUTH AND WEST OF THE BACKDOOR COLD FRONT...WITH SIMILAR IF PERHAPS SLIGHTLY COOLER READINGS TODAY AS COMPARED TO YESTERDAY. WITH LESS FORCING...FASTER STORM MOTION AND ONLY SLIGHTLY MORE SHEAR THAN YESTERDAY...DO NOT EXPECT A LOT OF ISSUES WITH ANY THUNDERSTORMS THOUGH AN ISOLATED SEVERE WIND GUST REPORT IS NOT COMPLETELY OUT OF THE QUESTION.  
MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH BACKDOOR COLD FRONT MOVING IN FROM THE NORTHEAST...AND LINGERING MOISTURE FROM STORMS YESTERDAY...ARE GOING TO BE THE MAIN ISSUE TO CONTEND WITH THIS MORNING. SOME AREAS WILL PROBABLY GO IFR (LOW CIGS AND PATCHY FOG) FOR A TIME BUT PREDICTING EXACTLY WHERE IS PROBLEMATIC...THOUGH ODDS FAVOR OUR NORTHEASTERN TERMINALS (BWI AND MTN) DUE TO PROXIMITY TO THE BACKDOOR FRONT. ANY SHOWERS THIS MORNING SHOULD BE RELATIVELY INNOCUOUS...AND THUNDERSTORMS WHICH MAY DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD BE RATHER HIT-OR-MISS. AT THE MOMENT...BEST ODDS APPEAR TO BE MID-AFTERNOON SO HAVE INCLUDED VCTS DURING THIS PERIOD. WINDS SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY BELOW 15 KNOTS...SHIFTING TO THE WEST AND NORTHWEST FROM THE EAST AND SOUTH AS THE DAYS GOES ON AND A FRONT DOOR COLD FRONT MOVES IN FROM THE WEST. NO AVIATION CONCERNS ON WEDNESDAY THOUGH WINDS WILL BE A BIT GUSTY FROM THE NORTHWEST.  DEPENDING ON THE TRACK OF LOW PRESSURE TO OUR SOUTH...SUB-VFR CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE ON THURSDAY IN LOW CLOUDS AND SHOWERS. THE PROBABILITY IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER AT CHO. OTHERWISE NO WIDESPREAD AVIATION ISSUES ARE EXPECTED IN THE OUTLOOK PERIOD.  
THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE SHOULD BE CONSIDERABLY LOWER TODAY COMPARED TO COVERAGE ON MONDAY...BUT A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ARE STILL POSSIBLE SO MARINERS SHOULD REMAIN ALERT. BEHIND THE COLD FRONT WHICH WILL PASS LATER THIS AFTERNOON...THE PRESSURE GRADIENT IS TIGHT ENOUGH SUCH THAT WINDS HAVE A GOOD SHOT AT GUSTING UP TO 20 KNOTS TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR THIS.  LOW PRESSURE WILL PASS THROUGH THE CAROLINAS AND OFFSHORE FROM WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. DEPENDING ON ITS TRACK...WINDS MAY APPROACH SCA LEVELS OVER MAINLY SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE MD BAY/LOWER POTOMAC. SHOWERS ARE ALSO POSSIBLE. NORTHERLY CHANNELING MAY OCCUR ON FRIDAY...BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW ON ABILITY TO REACH SCA LEVELS.  
HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS ANCHORED OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST THROUGH TUESDAY. A COLD FRONT CROSSES THE LOCAL AREA THIS EVENING INTO TONIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE SLOW TO BUILD INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  
AREA OF SHRAS/TSTMS MOVING TO THE ERN SHORE...AND OFF THE CST NEXT COUPLE/FEW HRS. MAY BE LINGERING ISOLD SHRAS INTO THE MID MRNG OVR THE RGN. A VERY WK BACKDOOR FNT RMNS IN PLACE NR THE CST...WHILE A CDFNT IS APPROACHING THE MTNS. THAT CDFNT FM THE W WILL BE CROSSING THE MTNS THIS MRNG...THEN CONTG TO THE E THROUGH THE AFTN INTO EARLY EVE. COMBO DAYTIME HEATING...MARGINAL INSTABILITY AND LINGERING CONVECTIVE BOUNDARIES MAY RESULT IN ISOLD/SCT CONVECTION MIDDAY/EARLY AFTN PRE-COLD FRONT. RIDGE ALOFT FLATTENS OUT...AND THERE IS SLGT COOLING ALOFT. THE PRIMARY AREA OF PSBL MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTION LATER TODAY XPCD TO BE E OF I95...ESP IN SE VA/NE NC. WARM AND HUMID AGAIN TODAY. HI TEMPS FM THE M80S TO ARND 90F (EXCEPT COOLER AT THE IMMEDIATE COAST).  
NWR SALISBURY MD OUT OF SERVICE UFN.  
WEAK SFC TROUGH OVER THE WATERS...WITH GENLY A LIGHT ONSHORE FLOW LESS THAN 10 KT...THOUGH WIND DIRECTIONS ARE SOMEWHAT CHAOTIC DUE TO SCATTERED TSTMS AND VERY WEAK PRESSURE GRADIENT. WINDS WIND SHIFT TO BECOME A BIT MORE ORGANIZED FROM THE S/SE LATER THIS EVENING...AND S/SW OVERNIGHT BUT SPEEDS AVG 10 KT OR LESS WITH SEAS ONLY 2-3 FT AND WAVES IN THE BAY ONLY AROUND 1 FOOT (1-2 FT MOUTH OF BAY). A COLD FRONT PUSHES ACROSS THE WATERS LATE TUE (WITH PSBL SHRAS/TSTMS). WINDS BECOME N-NW POST- FRONTAL TUE NIGHT. NOT A REAL STRONG COLD FRONT...BUT DOES APPEAR TO BE SUFFICIENT COOL AIR SURGE TO LEAD TO LOW END SCA CONDITIONS FOR THE BAY (AND PERHAPS THE RIVERS/SOUND). AT THIS TIME...KEEPING CONDS BELOW SCA FOR THE OCEAN. IT WILL TEND TO BE FAIRLY SHORT IN DURATION (AROUND 6 HRS..FROM AROUND 3-4 AM/WED THROUGH LATE MORNING OR NOON/WED). SFC HI PRES BUILDS INTO THE RGN FM THE W WED NIGHT...WITH A WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM PASSING BY TO THE SOUTH ON THU. SOME UNCERTAINTY ON EXACT TRACK OF THIS SYSTEM...FOR NOW MODELS KEEP WINDS FAIRLY LIGHT...10-15 KT AT MOST ALTHOUGH THIS COULD CHANGE. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS OVER THE AREA LATER FRI- SUN...FAIRLY COOL AIRMASS INITIALLY WILL LIKELY BRING SOME INCREASE IN WINDS FRI NIGHT INTO SAT.  
MD...NONE. NC...NONE. VA...NONE. MARINE...NONE.  
LOW CIGS ASSOCIATED WITH BACKDOOR COLD FRONT MOVING IN FROM THE NORTHEAST...AND LINGERING MOISTURE FROM STORMS YESTERDAY...ARE GOING TO BE THE MAIN ISSUE TO CONTEND WITH THIS MORNING. SOME AREAS WILL PROBABLY GO IFR FOR A TIME BUT PREDICTING EXACTLY WHERE IS PROBLEMATIC...THOUGH ODDS FAVOR OUR NORTHEASTERN TERMINALS (BWI AND MTN) DUE TO PROXIMITY TO THE BACKDOOR FRONT. ANY SHOWERS THIS MORNING SHOULD BE RELATIVELY INNOCUOUS...AND THUNDERSTORMS WHICH MAY DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD BE RATHER HIT-OR-MISS. SO...FOR NOW...HAVE NOT INCLUDED THUNDER IN TAFS...BUT WILL NEED TO RE- EVALUATE BASED ON LATEST GUIDANCE IN UPCOMING TAF PACKAGES. WINDS SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY BELOW 15 KNOTS...SHIFTING TO THE WEST AND NORTHWEST FROM THE EAST AND SOUTH AS THE DAYS GOES ON AND A FRONT DOOR COLD FRONT MOVES IN FROM THE WEST. NO AVIATION CONCERNS ON WEDNESDAY THOUGH WINDS WILL BE A LITTLE GUSTY FROM THE NORTH.  DEPENDING ON THE TRACK OF LOW PRESSURE TO OUR SOUTH...SUB-VFR CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE ON THURSDAY IN LOW CLOUDS AND SHOWERS. THE PROBABILITY IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER AT CHO. OTHERWISE NO WIDESPREAD AVIATION ISSUES ARE EXPECTED IN THE OUTLOOK PERIOD.   
THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE SHOULD BE CONSIDERABLY LOWER TODAY COMPARED TO COVERAGE ON MONDAY...BUT A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ARE STILL POSSIBLE SO MARINERS SHOULD REMAIN ALERT. BEHIND THE COLD FRONT WHICH WILL PASS LATER THIS AFTERNOON...WINDS MAY GUST UP TO 20 KNOTS TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY MAY BE NEEDED TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY.  LOW PRESSURE WILL PASS THROUGH THE CAROLINAS AND OFFSHORE FROM WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. DEPENDING ON ITS TRACK...WINDS MAY APPROACH SCA LEVELS OVER MAINLY SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE MD BAY/LOWER POTOMAC. SHOWERS ARE ALSO POSSIBLE. NORTHERLY CHANNELING MAY OCCUR ON FRIDAY...BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW ON ABILITY TO REACH SCA LEVELS.  
DC...NONE. MD...NONE. VA...NONE. WV...NONE. MARINE...NONE.  
A COLD FRONT IN OHIO EARLY TODAY WILL PASS THROUGH OUR FORECAST AREA LATE THIS AFTERNOON. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE WILL FOLLOW WEDNESDAY. LOW PRESSURE ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST LATE THURSDAY SHOULD MOVE OUT TO SEA BY FRIDAY. ANOTHER COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO ARRIVE FROM THE NORTHWEST FRIDAY AFTERNOON WITH STRONGER HIGH PRESSURE MOVING TO THE MID ATLANTIC COAST THIS WEEKEND. A WARM FRONT MAY APPROACH FROM THE SOUTHWEST FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY.   
AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO SHIFT TO OUR EAST EARLY THIS MORNING. THIS WILL TAKE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE EAST AS WELL, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A LESSENING OF THE MARINE INFLUENCE WITH TIME. BEFORE THIS HAPPENS THOUGH, STRATUS ALONG WITH SOME FOG REMAINS ACROSS THE CWA. THIS IS EXPECTED TO LIFT AND THIN OUT AS THE MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON WEARS ON, PLUS AS OUR WINDS VEER FROM ONSHORE TO SOUTHWEST AND WEST BY LATE AFTERNOON.  THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME WEAK ISENTROPIC UPGLIDE OVER THE THE MARINE LAYER AND THIS IS PRODUCING SOME SHOWERS. THE CONVECTIVE CLUSTER ACROSS THE DELMARVA CONTINUES TO GRADUALLY WEAKEN AS IT PROGRESSES INTO LESS LINGERING INSTABILITY AND BECOMES MORE ELEVATED WITH A NORTHEASTERN EXTENT. THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD WANE THROUGH THE MORNING, WITH SOME ADDITIONAL SHOWERS EXPECTED FROM THE WEST AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT.  THE MAIN SURFACE LOW AND DYNAMICS ARE LIFTING WELL TO OUR NORTH, HOWEVER THE BACKDOOR FRONT SHOULD EITHER LIFT NORTHWARD AS A WEAK WARM FRONT OR DISSIPATE AS THE LOW-LEVEL FLOW VEERS. AS THE FLOW INCREASES SOME ALOFT THROUGH THE DAY WITH AN INCOMING UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH, SOME INCREASE IN SHEAR AND PERHAPS SOME HELP BY EITHER A DIFFERENTIAL HEATING BOUNDARY OR ESPECIALLY A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO PRODUCE AT LEAST ISOLATED OR SCATTERED CONVECTION THROUGH THE AFTERNOON /AIDED BY SOME GRADUAL COOLING ALOFT/. OUR AREA THOUGH LOOKS TO BE ON THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE STRONGER FLOW ALOFT, WHICH PLACES OUR NORTHERN AREAS IN A BIT BETTER SETUP FOR A GUSTY THUNDERSTORM. THE FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW ONCE THE STRATUS BREAKS, ENOUGH HEATING OCCURS TO BOOST THE INSTABILITY HOWEVER THE AIRMASS ESPECIALLY IN THE MID TO UPPER LEVELS ARE FORECAST TO BE DRYING QUITE A BIT THIS AFTERNOON. THE DRYING MAY LIMIT OVERALL ORGANIZATION, HOWEVER IF SOME STRONG ENOUGH CONVECTIVE CORES CAN DEVELOP THEN LOCALLY GUSTY WINDS /ENHANCED BY A POSSIBLE LOW-LEVEL INVERTED-V SIGNATURE DEVELOPING BY LATE AFTERNOON/ CAN OCCUR.  AS FOR THE HIGH TEMPERATURES, WE USED MOSTLY AN EVEN BLEND OF THE GFS/NAM MOS. WE OPTED NOT TO GO ABOVE GUIDANCE OVERALL GIVEN THE EXPECTATION OF STRATUS TO BE AROUND FOR AWHILE THIS MORNING.  
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS FOR KPHL, KPNE, KTTN, KABE, KRDG, KILG, KMIV, KACY AND SURROUNDING AREAS.  TODAY...IFR/LIFR CEILINGS IMPROVING TO MVFR TOWARD LATE MORNING, THEN VFR DURING THE AFTERNOON AS A COLD FRONT APPROACHES. MOSTLY MVFR FOG AT TIMES IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE THROUGH THE MORNING. LIGHT EAST TO SOUTHEAST WINDS, TURNING TOWARDS THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST AROUND 10 KNOTS IN THE AFTERNOON. SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS /AFTERNOON/ ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT, HOWEVER THESE MAY BE MAINLY SCATTERED. LOWER CONFIDENCE ON THE TIMING OF IMPROVEMENT TO MVFR/VFR, AND ALSO SHOWER/THUNDER COVERAGE ESPECIALLY THIS AFTERNOON.  TONIGHT...A FEW SHOWERS OR A THUNDERSTORM EARLY, OTHERWISE VFR. WEST TO NORTHWEST WINDS MOSTLY 5-15 KNOTS.  OUTLOOK... WEDNESDAY...VFR.  SCT-BKN AOA 5000 FT. NORTHWEST GUSTY 15 TO 20 KT DURING THE DAY BECOME NEARLY CALM AT NIGHT.  THURSDAY...VFR.  SCT-BKN AOA 5000 FT.   GENERALLY WEST WIND GUST UNDER 15 KT. SMALL CHC OF SHOWERS PHL SEWD, ESPECIALLY S DE AND COASTAL SE NJ.  FRIDAY...VFR SCT-BKN AOA 5000 FT MAY BECOME COMPLETELY CLEAR NIGHT. WEST-NORTHWEST WIND GUSTY 20 KT SHOULD DIMINISH AT NIGHT.  SATURDAY...VFR NEARLY CLEAR.  LIGHT WIND.  
RESIDUAL SHOWERS OVER AREAS EAST OF PITTSBURGH WILL CONTINUE TO DISSIPATE EARLY THIS MORNING AS THE COLD FRONT...BEST DEFINED VIA DEWPOINT DIFFERENTIAL...ADVANCES ACROSS OHIO.  UPPER OHIO VALLEY AIRSPACE INITIALLY SHOULD BEGIN TO CLEAR OUT WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE LATER THIS MORNING...BUT ADDITIONAL CLOUDS IN THE FORM OF STRATOUCU ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE BACK IN FROM THE NORTHWEST AS COLD ADVECTION ENSUES IN EARNEST THIS AFTERNOON.  NEAR TERM TEMP ADJUSTMENTS WERE MINIMAL...BUT BASED ON NWS COLLABORATION AND A BLEND OF NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE.  
A COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO APPROACH FROM THE WEST TODAY, THEN PASS THROUGH OUR REGION EARLY TONIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW FOR WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. WEAK LOW PRESSURE IS ANTICIPATED TO PASS OFF THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST ON THURSDAY NIGHT BEFORE MOVING OUT TO SEA. ANOTHER COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO ARRIVE ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON WITH HIGH PRESSURE EXPECTED IN ITS WAKE FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. A WARM FRONT MAY THEN APPROACH FROM THE SOUTHWEST FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY.  
HIGH PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW THE COLD FRONT FOR WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY AND IT SHOULD BRING DRY WEATHER CONDITIONS AND BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES. READINGS MAY FALL INTO THE UPPER 30S IN PARTS OF THE POCONO REGION AND NORTHWESTERN NEW JERSEY EARLY ON THURSDAY MORNING. IT COULD BE CLOSE FOR LOCALIZED FROST.  THE MODEL GUIDANCE DIFFERS A BIT IN THE HANDLING OF THE WEAK LOW THAT IS EXPECTED TO PASS OFF THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST ON THURSDAY NIGHT. IT APPEARS AS THOUGH MID LEVEL CLOUDS WILL OVERSPREAD MUCH OF OUR REGION ON THURSDAY WITH STRATOCUMULUS REACHING OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES FOR LATE THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. WE ARE NOT PARTICULARLY CONFIDENT IN THE NORTHWARD EXTEND OF THE RAINFALL ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM. WE WILL SIMPLY FORECAST LOW CHANCE PROBABILITIES OF RAIN FOR OUR FAR SOUTHERN COUNTIES.  A MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGH IS FORECAST TO APPROACH FROM THE WEST ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND IT SHOULD PASS OVERHEAD ON FRIDAY MORNING. A SURFACE COLD FRONT IS ANTICIPATED TO FOLLOW ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON. THE SYSTEM WILL NOT HAVE MUCH MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH IT, SO WE WILL NOT FORECAST ANY RAINFALL.  SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO OUR REGION ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. THE CENTER OF THE HIGH IS EXPECTED TO PASS OFF THE COAST LATE ON SATURDAY. THE AIR MASS SHOULD BRING OUR FORECAST AREA DRY WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY ALONG WITH NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES.  WARMTH AND MOISTURE WILL LIKELY BE ON THE INCREASE ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE HIGH AS WE GET INTO LATE SUNDAY AND MONDAY. WE ARE ANTICIPATING AN INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER IN THE DEVELOPING ISENTROPIC LIFT. ALSO, WE WILL INDICATE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AT THAT TIME.  
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS FOR KPHL, KPNE, KTTN, KABE, KRDG, KILG, KMIV, KACY AND SURROUNDING AREAS.  TODAY...IFR/LIFR CEILINGS IMPROVING TO MVFR TOWARD LATE MORNING, THEN VFR DURING THE AFTERNOON AS A COLD FRONT APPROACHES. MOSTLY MVFR FOG AT TIMES IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE THROUGH THE MORNING. LIGHT EAST TO SOUTHEAST WINDS, TURNING TOWARDS THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST AROUND 10 KNOTS IN THE AFTERNOON. SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS /AFTERNOON/ ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT, HOWEVER THESE MAY BE MAINLY SCATTERED. LOWER CONFIDENCE ON THE TIMING OF IMPROVEMENT TO MVFR/VFR, AND ALSO SHOWER/THUNDER COVERAGE ESPECIALLY THIS AFTERNOON.  TONIGHT...A FEW SHOWERS OR A THUNDERSTORM EARLY, OTHERWISE VFR. WEST TO NORTHWEST WINDS MOSTLY 5-15 KNOTS.  OUTLOOK... WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...MAINLY VFR.  
A LIGHT ONSHORE FLOW TO START TODAY WILL VEER TO SOUTH THEN TO SOUTHWEST AND WEST BY LATE AFTERNOON. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THIS EVENING WITH CAA DEVELOPING IN ITS WAKE. THE CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE BELOW SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CRITERIA TODAY INTO TONIGHT, HOWEVER THE CAA LATE TONIGHT AND MAINLY TOWARD DAYBREAK WEDNESDAY MAY ALLOW FOR WIND GUSTS TO NEAR 25 KNOTS. THIS LOOKS SHORT IN DURATION THOUGH IF IT WERE TO OCCUR. SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TODAY INTO TONIGHT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT.  OUTLOOK... WEDNESDAY...WIND GUSTS MAY APPROACH 25 KNOTS, ESPECIALLY EARLY.  WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...NO MARINE HEADLINES ARE ANTICIPATED.  
WIND GUSTS MAY BE AROUND 20 MPH FROM THE NORTHWEST ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES MAY FALL INTO THE 30 TO 35 PERCENT RANGE AT THAT TIME, ESPECIALLY IN PARTS OF EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW JERSEY.  
HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS ANCHORED OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST THROUGH TUESDAY. A COLD FRONT CROSSES THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  
LATEST REGIONAL RADAR MOSAIC DEPICTS ISOLATED TO WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE NW COUNTIES...WITH ANOTHER ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM OVER HOPEWELL AS OF THIS WRITING. BETTER COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOUND JUST NORTH OF THE LOCAL AREA. EARLIER THUNDERSTORMS HAVE LEFT BEHIND SEVERAL BOUNDARIES THIS EVENING. WARM/HUMID AIRMASS REMAINS IN PLACE...WITH RAP MESOANALYSIS DEPICTING 1000-1500 J/KG MLCAPE. BETTER FORCING ALOFT ALSO INDICATED (ALBEIT LIMITED OVER THE LOCAL AREA) AS A SHORTWAVE VISIBLE ON WATER VAPOR LIFTS ACROSS THE OH VALLEY. EXPECT THE BEST COVERAGE OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS TO REMAIN NORTH OF THE LOCAL AREA TONIGHT...BUT COMBINATION OF OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES AND WARM/MOIST/RELATIVELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS WILL RESULT IN SLIGHT CHANCE- CHANCE POPS THRU THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD. STORMS EXPECTED TO REMAIN SUB- SEVERE DUE TO WEAK SHEAR PROFILES...BUT MEAN FLOW AOB 10 KT WILL RESULT IN LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL.  BACKDOOR FRONT ALSO LOCATED OVER THE MD ERN SHORE THIS EVENING...WITH ONSHORE FLOW OBSERVED AT OCEAN CITY WITH TEMPS DROPPING INTO THE MID 60S. FOG OBSERVED DOV/GED/OXB...WITH ADDITIONAL FOG EXPECTED THANKS TO ONSHORE FLOW. HAVE INCLUDED AREAS OF FOG GENERALLY EAST OF HIGHWAY 13 IN MD. DO NOT ANTICIPATE DENSE FOG ATTM. MILD TONIGHT WITH LOWS IN THE UPPER 60S TO AROUND 70 DEGREES. SKIES AVG PARTLY CLOUDY.  
A COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE MIDWEST THIS AFTN WILL REACH THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS AROUND 12Z TUE. THE COLD FRONT THEN CROSSES THE LOCAL AREA TUESDAY AFTN/EVE...BEFORE PUSHING OFFSHORE TUE NIGHT. BULK SHEAR REMAINS MARGINAL AT BEST AND DOWNSLOPE FLOW ALOFT IS LESS THAN IDEAL FOR WIDESPREAD CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER...STRONG SFC HEATING PRE-FRONTAL SHOULD YIELD ANOTHER ROUND OF SCATTERED SHWRS/TSTMS IN THE AFTN/EVE. WARM AND HUMID AGAIN TUE. HIGHS FROM THE MID 80S TO AROUND 90 (EXCEPT COOLER AT THE IMMEDIATE COAST). LOWS TUE NIGHT IN THE 60S.  COOL/DRY HIGH PRESSURE BEGINS TO BUILD TOWARD THE AREA FROM THE WEST ON WEDNESDAY...YIELDING A DRIER/MORE COMFORTABLE DAY WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE. HIGH TEMPS FROM THE MID 70S NORTH TO THE LOW 80S SOUTH. COMFORTABLE WED NIGHT WITH LOWS IN THE MID 50S TO LOW 60S. SHORTWAVE ENERGY DIVES SOUTH INTO THE CAROLINAS ON THURSDAY WITH WEAK SFC LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPING ALONG A STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY. MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL GET SHOVED NORTHWARD INTO THE LOCAL AREA...ESPECIALLY IN THE AFTN/EVE. WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY CHC POPS FOR MUCH OF THE AREA. HOWEVER...IT APPEARS THE HIGHEST LIKELIHOOD OF PCPN WILL BE ACROSS SE PARTS OF THE FA. PLEASANT TEMPS ON THU WITH HIGHS MOSTLY IN THE 70S.  
SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL COME TO AN END AS A COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE REGION THIS MORNING. SEASONABLY COOL TEMPERATURES WILL PERSIST FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.  
NO CHANGES WERE NEEDED TO THE NEAR TERM FORECAST FOR THE MIDNIGHT UPDATE AS SHOWER ACTIVITY CONTINUES TO SLOWLY DISSIPATE WITH THE COLD FRONT...BEST DEFINED VIA DEWPOINT DIFFERENTIAL...ADVANCING OUT OF THE MIDWEST.  UPPER OHIO VALLEY AIRSPACE INITIALLY SHOULD BEGIN TO CLEAR OUT WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE LATER THIS MORNING...BUT ADDITIONAL CLOUDS IN THE FORM OF STRATOUCU ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE BACK IN FROM THE NORTHWEST AS COLD ADVECTION ENSUES IN EARNEST THIS AFTERNOON.  
TEMPERATURES ABOUT 5 TO 10 DEGREES BELOW THE AVERAGES ARE PROJECTED TO PERSIST FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SHORT TERM PERIOD. FEW CHANGES WERE NEEDED FOR THE ONGOING TEMPERATURE FORECAST...BUT TWEAKS WERE BASED ON THE LATEST ADJUSTED MET AND GFS MOS TRENDS.  MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE SHORT TERM PERIOD WERE IN THE FORM OF PRECIP PROBABILITY ADDITIONS...ALBEIT SLIGHT TO LOW END CHANCE NUMBERS...AS GFS AND NAM CONT TO GENERATE SOME LIGHT PRECIP OVER AREAS SOUTH OF I 80 WITH A RAPIDLY CROSSING SHORTWAVE IN THE PREDAWN OF THURSDAY. PROGGED MOISTURE PROFILES DO NOT INDICATE A SATURATED COLUMN...HENCE ANY SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LIGHT AND MAY NOT EXCEED THE SPRINKLE CATEGORY. MINIMAL POP NUMBERS WILL SUFFICE FOR NOW...AS THEY WILL WITH A REINFORCING FRONT PROJECTED FOR FRIDAY ENCROACHMENT.  
SURFACE RIDGING BUILDING UNDER A DEPARTING BROAD UPPER EAST COAST TROUGH SHOULD BRING DRY WEATHER THROUGH EARLY SUNDAY. A SLOWLY ADVANCING PLAINS AND MIDWEST TROUGH IS PROGGED TO BRING INCREASING SHOWER CHANCES BY LATE SUNDAY INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK.  FOLLOWED THE WPC ENSEMBLE SOLUTION TO SMOOTH OUT INDIVIDUAL MODEL DIFFERENCES. AFTER A COOL START...TEMPERATURES SHOULD RISE ABOVE SEASONAL LEVELS BY THE WEEKEND.  
HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE REMAINS INTO OUR REGION FROM THE NORTHEAST AND EAST OVERNIGHT. A COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO APPROACH FROM THE WEST ON TUESDAY, THEN PASS THROUGH OUR REGION EARLY TUESDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW FOR WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. WEAK LOW PRESSURE IS ANTICIPATED TO PASS OFF THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST ON THURSDAY NIGHT BEFORE MOVING OUT TO SEA. ANOTHER COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO ARRIVE ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON WITH HIGH PRESSURE EXPECTED IN ITS WAKE FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. A WARM FRONT MAY THEN APPROACH FROM THE SOUTHWEST FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY.  
A QUICK UPDATE WAS ISSUED TO LOWER POPS EASTWARD FOR AWHILE AND FOCUS THE HIGHER POPS ACROSS MARYLANDS EASTERN SHORE WHERE A CONVECTIVE CLUSTER IS SLOWLY MOVING EAST /POPS MAY NEED TO BE INCREASED FURTHER DEPENDING ON TRENDS/. THIS IS WEAKENING SOME WITH AN EASTWARD EXTENT AS IT BECOMES MORE ELEVATED, HOWEVER SOME LIGHTNING IS STILL OCCURRING. IT IS HERE WHERE WE MENTION THUNDER. SOME HIGHER POPS ALSO ACROSS THE WESTERN ZONES WITH WEAKENING SHOWERS, HOWEVER SOME OF THIS SHOULD SPREAD EAST. THE CLOUD COVER WAS INCREASED TO CLOUDY AND TEMPERATURES WERE LOWERED SOME TO ACCOUNT FOR THE LATEST CONDITIONS /THIS RESULTED IN LOWERING THE MINIMUM TEMPERATURES FOR SEVERAL AREAS AS WELL/.  OTHERWISE, THE BACKDOOR FRONT HAS PUSHED THROUGH OUR ENTIRE CWA. A COOL, STABLE LOW-LEVEL AIRMASS IS NOW IN PLACE FOR EVERYONE, EXCEPT FOR PORTIONS OF THE EASTERN SHORE OF MARYLAND. WITH THIS STABLE AIR IN PLACE, THE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY TO OUR WEST HAS WEAKENED AS IT CROSSED THE INSTABILITY BOUNDARY AND MOVED INTO OUR AREA THIS EVENING. PW VALUES REMAIN HIGH, OVER 1.75 INCHES, SO SOME SHOWERS WILL HAVE MODERATE TO HEAVY RAINFALL.  CONTINUED ONSHORE FLOW WILL KEEP US DAMP AND RELATIVELY COOL. SOME FOG/DRIZZLE WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE AREA. THERE IS ANOTHER AREA OF SHOWERS THAT SHOULD PUSH IN LATE OVERNIGHT FROM THE WEST AS A WEAK WARM FRONT LIFTS TOWARDS THE REGION AND A MID-LEVEL SHORT WAVE APPROACHES.  
THE WARM FRONT SHOULD LIFT THROUGH BY LATE TUESDAY MORNING WITH MORE VEERING IN THE LOW-LEVEL WINDS EXPECTED. DEEP LAYER SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL KEEP MOISTURE STREAMING INTO THE REGION AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT...THOUGH A BIT LOWER THAN TODAYS. THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO PASS THROUGH DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS AND THERE MAY BE TOO MUCH CLOUD COVER IN PLACE, BUT GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE AND SOMEWHAT BETTER SHEAR EXPECTED TOMORROW, IT MAY NOT TAKE MUCH SURFACE HEATING TO GET THINGS GOING.  
A COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO SWEEP ACROSS OUR REGION FROM THE NORTHWEST EARLY ON TUESDAY NIGHT. WHILE THE FRONTAL PASSAGE ITSELF SHOULD BE DRY, THERE MAY BE SOME SHOWER ACTIVITY AHEAD OF THE BOUNDARY ON TUESDAY EVENING.  HIGH PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW THE COLD FRONT FOR WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY AND IT SHOULD BRING DRY WEATHER CONDITIONS AND BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES. READINGS MAY FALL INTO THE UPPER 30S IN PARTS OF THE POCONO REGION AND NORTHWESTERN NEW JERSEY EARLY ON THURSDAY MORNING. IT COULD BE CLOSE FOR LOCALIZED FROST.  THE MODEL GUIDANCE DIFFERS A BIT IN THE HANDLING OF THE WEAK LOW THAT IS EXPECTED TO PASS OFF THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST ON THURSDAY NIGHT. IT APPEARS AS THOUGH MID LEVEL CLOUDS WILL OVERSPREAD MUCH OF OUR REGION ON THURSDAY WITH STRATOCUMULUS REACHING OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES FOR LATE THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. WE ARE NOT PARTICULARLY CONFIDENT IN THE NORTHWARD EXTEND OF THE RAINFALL ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM. WE WILL SIMPLY FORECAST LOW CHANCE PROBABILITIES OF RAIN FOR OUR FAR SOUTHERN COUNTIES.  A MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGH IS FORECAST TO APPROACH FROM THE WEST ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND IT SHOULD PASS OVERHEAD ON FRIDAY MORNING. A SURFACE COLD FRONT IS ANTICIPATED TO FOLLOW ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON. THE SYSTEM WILL NOT HAVE MUCH MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH IT, SO WE WILL NOT FORECAST ANY RAINFALL.  SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO OUR REGION ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. THE CENTER OF THE HIGH IS EXPECTED TO PASS OFF THE COAST LATE ON SATURDAY. THE AIR MASS SHOULD BRING OUR FORECAST AREA DRY WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY ALONG WITH NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES.  WARMTH AND MOISTURE WILL LIKELY BE ON THE INCREASE ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE HIGH AS WE GET INTO LATE SUNDAY AND MONDAY. WE ARE ANTICIPATING AN INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER IN THE DEVELOPING ISENTROPIC LIFT. ALSO, WE WILL INDICATE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AT THAT TIME.  
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS FOR KPHL, KPNE, KTTN, KABE, KRDG, KILG, KMIV, KACY AND SURROUNDING AREAS.  OVERNIGHT...IFR/LIFR CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE, AND SOME SHOWERS WILL MOVE ACROSS PARTS OF THE AREA. ANY THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD REMAIN SOUTHWEST OF KILG. WINDS ARE EASTERLY, BUT MAY BECOME MORE SOUTHEASTERLY LATE.  TUESDAY...IFR CONDITIONS DURING THE MORNING TRENDING TOWARDS MVFR BY LATE MORNING/EARLY AFTERNOON. CONDITIONS SHOULD RETURN TO VFR BY THE MID/LATE AFTERNOON AS A COLD FRONT APPROACHES. WINDS VEER MORE TOWARDS THE SOUTH- SOUTHWEST TOMORROW AFTERNOON, THEN WEST OR NORTHWEST BEHIND THE COLD FRONT BY TOMORROW EVENING. THE COLD FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE WEST DURING THE AFTERNOON WITH MORE CHANCES OF SHOWERS/THUNDER.  OUTLOOK... TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...MAINLY VFR.  
TONIGHT - MONDAY...SUB-SCA CONDITIONS TONIGHT THOUGH SEAS MAY BE BE CLOSE TO 5 FEET ACROSS THE NORTH UNDER THE BETTER NE FETCH. OTHERWISE WE SHOULD REMAIN BELOW CRITERIA AND SEE SEAS DECREASE A BIT WITH A LESSENING PRESSURE GRADIENT AND WINDS VEERING TOWARDS THE SOUTH-SOUTHEAST.  OUTLOOK...  TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...WIND GUSTS MAY APPROACH 25 KNOTS, ESPECIALLY FROM LATE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING.  WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...NO MARINE HEADLINES ARE ANTICIPATED.  
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL COME TO AN END AS A COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE REGION TUESDAY MORNING. SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE FORECAST FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY.  
950PM UPDATE...SHOWER ACTIVITY CONTINUING TO SLOWLY DISSIPATE. FRONTAL PASSAGE LOOKS ON TIME FOR LATE TONIGHT...EARLY TUESDAY MORNING.  PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...  MOST OF THE AREA HAS SEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...WITH NORTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE REGION THE LAST AREA FOR SHOWERS TO BEGIN. WHILE ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO PEAK IN THE LATE AFTERNOON FOLLOWING A DIURNAL CYCLE...SHOWERS AND AT LEAST ISOLATED/SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE EVENING AND INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. ALMOST ALL OF THE RAIN WILL OCCUR IN ADVANCE OF A COLD FRONT THAT AS OF MID AFTERNOON REMAINS BACK ACROSS ILLINOIS AND INDIANA. SKIES SHOULD BEGIN TO CLEAR OUT WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE TUESDAY MORNING...BUT ADDITIONAL CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE BACK IN FROM THE NORTHWEST DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. HIGHS ON TUESDAY WILL REMAIN SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL...ALTHOUGH COOLER THAN TODAY.  
THE PASSAGE OF THE COLD FRONT WILL BE FELT THE MOST TUESDAY NIGHT...AS TEMPERATURES WILL TUMBLE INTO THE LOW TO MID 40S OVERNIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE APPROACHING FROM THE PLAINS WILL KEEP A NORTHERLY COMPONENT TO WINDS...AND THIS WILL KEEP HIGHS ON WEDNESDAY IN THE 60S...WITH LOCATIONS ALONG THE INTERSTATE 80 CORRIDOR REMAINING ALL THE WAY IN THE 50S. SOME SLIGHT TEMPERATURE MODERATION IS EXPECTED FOR THURSDAY. MODELS ARE IN A BIT OF DISAGREEMENT AS TO WHETHER ANY PRECIPITATION MAY SKIRT THE SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE REGION WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY WITH ANOTHER SYSTEM. DID NOT DECIDE TO ADD ANY PRECIPITATION TO THE FORECAST AT THIS TIME...BUT HAVE AT LEAST BUMPED UP SKY COVER DURING THAT TIME PERIOD.  

VFR CONDITIONS PREVAIL OVER ALL TERMINALS EARLY THIS EVENING. EARLIER TSTMS AT KECG/KSBY HAVE DISSIPATED. WILL MAINTAIN VCSH AT KRIC THROUGH 04Z...DUE TO LINGERING INSTABILITY/BOUNDARIES IN THE AREA...WHCIH COULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHWRS/TSTMS. HI RES MODELS WOULD SUGGEST POTENTIAL FOR SCTD SHWRS/TSTMS ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA WEST OF TBE BAY THROUGH 06Z. BUT NOT ENOUGH CONFIDENCE AT THIS TIME TO PUT PREVAILING PRECIP IN KRIC TAF. SHWRS/TSTMS IN THE SHENANDOAH VLY SSWWD TOWARD KROA COULD MOVE INTO THE REGION AFTER 04Z...AND THIS WILL BE MONITORED.  IFR CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN FORECAST OVERNIGHT AT KECG/KSBY...WHERE PRECIP FELL THIS AFTERNOON...AND SKIES WILL BE MAINLY CLR WITH LIGHT WINDS OVERNIGHT. MOIST ONSHORE COMPONENT TO LOW LVL FLOW AT KSBY WILL ALSO BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. CONTINUED CHCS FOR SHWRS/TSTMS ON TUESDAY AS COLD FRONT APPROACHES. HOWEVER...CONFIDENCE LOW ON TIMING/LOCATION...SO HAVE LEFT OUT OF 00Z TAFS.  FRONT MOVES THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...WITH CLEARING SKIES AND VFR CONDITIONS THROUGH WEDNESDAY. NEXT THREAT FOR SHWRS/TSTMS WILL BE THURSDAY AS A SHORT WAVE TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE REGION.  
HIGH PRESSURE WILL NOSE INTO OUR REGION FROM THE NORTHEAST AND EAST FOR TONIGHT. A COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO APPROACH FROM THE WEST ON TUESDAY AND IT SHOULD PASS THROUGH OUR REGION EARLY ON TUESDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW FOR WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. WEAK LOW PRESSURE IS ANTICIPATED TO PASS OFF THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST ON THURSDAY NIGHT BEFORE MOVING OUT TO SEA. ANOTHER COLD FRONT FROM THE NORTHWEST IS FORECAST TO ARRIVE ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON WITH HIGH PRESSURE EXPECTED IN ITS WAKE FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. A WARM FRONT MAY APPROACH FROM THE SOUTHWEST FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY.  
THE BACKDOOR COLD FRONT HAS PUSHED THROUGH ALL OF OUR ENTIRE CWA THIS EVENING. COOL, STABLE AIR IS NOW IN PLACE FOR EVERYONE, EXCEPT FOR PORTIONS OF THE EASTERN SHORE OF MARYLAND, BUT THE COOL AND STABLE SHOULD CONTINUE TO PUSH WESTWARD IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS. WITH THIS STABLE AIR IN PLACE, THE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY TO OUR WEST HAS WEAKENED AS IT CROSSED THE INSTABILITY BOUNDARY AND MOVED INTO OUR AREA THIS EVENING. WHILE WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE, WE WILL STILL KEEP ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS IN THE FORECAST, BUT WE EXPECT MOSTLY THUNDER-LESS SHOWERS THROUGH THE NIGHT. PW VALUES REMAIN HIGH, OVER 1.75 INCHES, SO SOME SHOWERS COULD HAVE MODERATE TO HEAVY RAINFALL.  CONTINUED ONSHORE FLOW WILL KEEP US DAMP AND RELATIVELY COOL. SKIES HAVE LOWED AND AREAS OF FOG/DRIZZLE WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND REMAIN ACROSS THE ARE INTO THE NIGHT. THERE IS ANOTHER AREA OF RAIN THAT SHOULD PUSH IN LATE TONIGHT FROM THE WEST AS A WEAK WARM FRONT LIFTS TOWARDS THE REGION AND MID-LEVEL SHORTWAVE APPROACHES. WINDS VEER MORE TOWARDS THE SOUTHEAST. TEMPERATURES TONIGHT WILL BE COOLER THAN PREVIOUS NIGHTS, ESPECIALLY WHERE WE HAVE HAD THE FOG/STRATUS ALL DAY ...UPPER-50S TO LOW-60S EXPECTED.  
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS FOR KPHL, KPNE, KTTN, KABE, KRDG, KILG, KMIV, KACY AND SURROUNDING AREAS.  THIS EVENING - TONIGHT...IFR CONDITIONS HAVE MOVED ACROSS THE AREA NOW THAT THE BACKDOOR COLD FRONT HAS PUSHED THROUGH THE AREA. IFR/LIFR CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE NIGHT, AND SHOWERS WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH THE NIGHT AS WELL. NO THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED AS THE AIRMASS IS COOL AND STABLE BEHIND THE BACKDOOR COLD FRONT. WINDS ARE GENERALLY EASTERLY, BUT MAY BECOME MORE SOUTHEASTERLY THROUGH THE NIGHT.  TUESDAY...IFR CONDITIONS DURING THE MORNING TRENDING TOWARDS MVFR BY LATE MORNING/EARLY AFTERNOON. CONDITIONS SHOULD RETURN TO VFR BY THE MID/LATE AFTERNOON AS A COLD FRONT APPROACHES. WINDS VEER MORE TOWARDS THE SOUTH- SOUTHWEST TOMORROW AFTERNOON, THEN WEST OR NORTHWEST BEHIND THE COLD FRONT BY TOMORROW EVENING. THE COLD FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE WEST DURING THE AFTERNOON WITH MORE CHANCES OF SHOWERS/THUNDER.  OUTLOOK...  TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...MAINLY VFR.  
A WARM AND HUMID AIRMASS WILL BE IN PLACE TONIGHT. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA ON TUESDAY. COOLER AND DRY HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN FROM MIDWEEK THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF THE WEEKEND.  
A WARM AND HUMID AIRMASS IS IN PLACE ACROSS THE MID-ATLANTIC TONIGHT. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE BEEN ONGOING UNDER A 500MB RIDGE. INSTABILITY IS HIGH ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION WITH ML CAPE 1K-2K J/KG. THE SHEAR IS STILL VERY LOW DUE TO THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AND THEREFORE THUNDERSTORMS HAVE NOT BEEN SEVERE. MOST STORMS HAVE BEEN INITIATING ON OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES AND MOVING SLOWLY DUE TO THE WEAK STEERING FLOW. HEAVY RAIN CONTINUES TO BE THE MAIN THREAT TONIGHT WITH PWATS AROUND 1.8 INCHES. LUCKILY STEERING FLOW IS WESTERLY SO STORMS HAVE BEEN PROGRESSING BUT SLOWLY.  TWO MORE ROUNDS OF RAINFALL ARE EXPECTED FOR NRN MD TONIGHT. A MORE ORGAINIZED AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IS MOVING ACROSS THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY AND EASTERN PANHANDLE THIS EVENING. THESE ARE EXPECTED TO SLOWLY MOVE EASTWARD TONIGHT. AN AREA OF CONCERN IS NORTH-CENTRAL/NE MD AS PAST STORMS PRODUCED 1-3 INCHES OF RAIN IN A SHORT AMT OF TIME. REPORTS WE HAVE SEEN ARE NUISANCE FLOODING IN POOR DRAINAGE AREAS AND PONDING ON ROADWAYS. RIVERS SEEM TO BE REACTLY SLOW ENOUGH TO NOT CAUSE ANY ISSUES AT THIS TIME BUT WILL NEED TO BE CLOSELY MONITORED INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. FLASH FLOOD WARNINGS MAY BE ISSUED FOR LOCALIZED FLOODING. USE CAUTION WHILE DRIVING THIS EVENING AS IT IS HARD TO SEE FLOODED ROADWAYS.  PREV DISCUSSION...  TONIGHT WILL BE UNSEASONABLY WARM AND QUITE HUMID AGAIN WITH LOWS SIMILAR TO...IF NOT A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER THAN...THIS MORNING.  A COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH DURING THE DAY ON TUESDAY. CONVECTIVE TEMPS ARE AGAIN IN THE LOW/MID 80S...BUT THE MITIGATING FACTOR IS TIME-RELATED...WITH THE FRONT THROUGH MOST OF THE AREA BY EARLY AFTERNOON...AND WINDS SHIFTING OUT OF THE WEST...A MAJOR HINDRANCE TO PRECIP DEVELOPMENT. POPS WERE LOWERED WEST OF THE BLUE RIDGE...AND KEPT AT LESS THAN 50/50 WEST OF THE METRO AREAS. PWATS ARE ALSO NOT AS IMPRESSIVE TOMORROW...AND THERE IS MORE STEERING FLOW...SO THE HEAVY RAIN THREAT DECREASES TOO.  
GENERAL CONSENSUS AMONGST THE 12Z MODEL SUITE HAS THE COLD FRONT EXTENDING JUST EAST OF THE CHESAPEAKE BAY BY TUES EVENING. MOSTLY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT LACKING IN ANY SIGNIFICANT FORCING LENDS TO ANY PCPN ACTIVITY TUES EVENING BEING DRIVEN BY SFC INSTABILITY AND LIFT PRODUCED BY THE COLD FRONT. AS SUCH...SCT SHOWERS AND MAYBE AN ISO TSTM PSBL INITIALLY TUES EVENING...BUT WILL QUICKLY TAPER POPS OFF AS THE FRONT CLEARS THE AREA ALONG WITH LOSS OF DIURNAL HEATING.  DRY WX BY THE SECOND HALF OF THE NIGHT AND LASTING THRU WED AS SFC HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES BUILDS IN....WITH THE REGION REMAINING ON THE EASTERN PERIPHERY. SUBSIDENCE ALOFT AIDES IN MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES...WITH SCT CU PSBL. INCREASING CLOUDS WED NIGHT WITH SFC LOW PRESSURE ATTEMPTING TO ORGANIZE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN. OVERRIDING PCPN COULD POSSIBLY MOVE IN BY LATE WED TO SOUTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA...WITH MOST OF THE AREA STAYING DRY TILL AFTR DAYBREAK THURS MORNING.  CAA BEHIND THE COLD FRONT WILL DROP TEMPS BACK TO MORE SEASONAL LVLS...LOWS 40S AND 50S AND HIGHS UPPER 60S TO MID 70S.  
LOW PRES TO OUR SOUTH MOVES OFFSHORE THU NIGHT INTO FRI... BRINGING SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS MAINLY TO THE S AND SE OF THE CWA. SHOWERS LOCATION WILL DEPEND ON THE TRACK OF THIS LOW PRES... WHICH IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS MOMENT. HIGH PRES BUILDS INTO THE REGION FRI AND INTO SUN... BRINGING DRIER CONDITIONS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE WEEKEND. RETURN FLOW INCREASES MOISTURE TO THE REGION FOR SUN... AND THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND AFTERNOON TSTMS. A WARM FRONT APPROACHES LATE ON SUN INTO MON. SOME SHOWERS AND AFTERNOON TSTMS ARE POSSIBLE ON MON AS WELL. HIGH TEMPS WILL BE IN THE UPR 70S TO LOW 80S FOR FRI AND SAT...IN THE LOW 80S FOR SUN... AND IN THE UPR 80S FOR MON.  
SHRA/TSRA CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS THE MID-ATLANTIC THIS EVENING. VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED OUTSIDE ACTIVITY BUT HEAVY RAIN WILL CAUSE VSBYS TO DROP TO SUB-MVFR. MULTIPLE ROUNDS WILL LIKELY IMPACT THE BWI/MTN.  LOW STRATUS MAY MOVE INTO BWI/MTN EARLY TUES MORNING AS A BOUNDARY MOVES SOUTHWARD. KEPT CIGS AT MVFR FOR NOW. ALSO CANNOT RULE OUT PATCHY FOG THOUGH OVERCAST SPREADING IN FROM THE WEST MAY KEEP THAT FROM BEING A BIG ISSUE. LOWER VSBYS POSSIBLE IN SCTD TO NUMEROUS SHRA/TSRA THROUGH EARLY EVENING TODAY.  VFR CONDITIONS TUES NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. NW WINDS WED 10-15 KTS WED AFTN...PSBL GUSTS UP TO 20 KTS. SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS PSBL THU NIGHT.  
LIGHT WINDS ON THE WATERS THROUGH TUESDAY. GUSTY WINDS POSSIBLE IN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AND SMW CANNOT BE RULED OUT TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY.  SCA CONDITIONS BCMG MORE LIKELY TUES NIGHT THRU WED MORNING BEHIND THE COLD FRONT ON THE CHESAPEAKE BAY AND MAYBE LOWER TIDAL POTOMAC. SCA GUSTS PSBL THRU WED AFTN...WITH ALL WATERS BCMG SUB- SCA BY WED NIGHT AND REMAINING THAT WAY THROUGH FRIDAY.  
UNUSUALLY WARM WEATHER CONTINUES THROUGH TOMORROW. RECORD HIGH MINIMUMS MAY BE BROKEN AT DCA AND IAD TODAY /MAY 18TH/ AND COULD BE APPROACHED TOMORROW MORNING TOO. RECORD HI MINS FOLLOW...  SITE...MAY 18TH.........MAY 19TH.........  DCA....68 (1995*).......70 (1986/1962)... BWI....68 (1900/1896)...75 (1877)........ IAD....66 (1995)........66 (1969)........  *ALSO IN 1953...1943 AND 1900.  
830PM UPDATE...CONTINUE TO UPDATE POPS AS SHOWERS...ISO STORMS... ARE WEAKENING AND DISSIPATING. WILL USE A COMBINATION OF LATEST RADAR PICS AND HIRES MODEL OUTPUT FOR EVENING/OVERNIGHT FORECAST. TEMPS WILL AGAIN BE MODIFIED WITH LATEST LAMP NUMBERS.  PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...  MOST OF THE AREA HAS SEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...WITH NORTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE REGION THE LAST AREA FOR SHOWERS TO BEGIN. WHILE ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO PEAK IN THE LATE AFTERNOON FOLLOWING A DIURNAL CYCLE...SHOWERS AND AT LEAST ISOLATED/SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE EVENING AND INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. ALMOST ALL OF THE RAIN WILL OCCUR IN ADVANCE OF A COLD FRONT THAT AS OF MID AFTERNOON REMAINS BACK ACROSS ILLINOIS AND INDIANA. SKIES SHOULD BEGIN TO CLEAR OUT WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE TUESDAY MORNING...BUT ADDITIONAL CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE BACK IN FROM THE NORTHWEST DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. HIGHS ON TUESDAY WILL REMAIN SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL...ALTHOUGH COOLER THAN TODAY.  
6PM UPDATE...HAVE MADE CHANGES TO EVENING POPS IN LINE WITH LATEST RADAR IMAGERY AND HIRES MODEL OUTPUT. PERIODS OF SHOWERS AND STORMS ARE EXPECTED THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS...AS PREFRONTAL TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH. INTENSITY OF CONVECTION SHOULD DIMINISH AS THE EVENING PROGRESSES. HAVE INCLUDED THE MENTION OF HEAVY RAIN...DUE TO DEWPOINTS IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S...PUSHING PWAT VALUES ABOVE 1.7 INCHES.  PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...  MOST OF THE AREA HAS SEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...WITH NORTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE REGION THE LAST AREA FOR SHOWERS TO BEGIN. WHILE ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO PEAK IN THE LATE AFTERNOON FOLLOWING A DIURNAL CYCLE...SHOWERS AND AT LEAST ISOLATED/SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE EVENING AND INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. ALMOST ALL OF THE RAIN WILL OCCUR IN ADVANCE OF A COLD FRONT THAT AS OF MID AFTERNOON REMAINS BACK ACROSS ILLINOIS AND INDIANA. SKIES SHOULD BEGIN TO CLEAR OUT WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE TUESDAY MORNING...BUT ADDITIONAL CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE BACK IN FROM THE NORTHWEST DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. HIGHS ON TUESDAY WILL REMAIN SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL...ALTHOUGH COOLER THAN TODAY.  
A WARM/HUMID AIRMASS RESIDES OVER THE FA THIS AFTERNOON WITH MAX TEMPS TOPPING OUT IN THE MID 80S TO LOW 90S. THERE IS NO STRONG FORCING FOR CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...WITH A LEE (THERMAL) TROUGH IN PLACE ACROSS THE PIEDMONT...AND A WEAK BACK DOOR COLD FRONT OVER THE DELMARVA...ISOLD TO WDLY SCT TSTMS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP AS OF EARLY AFTN AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN COVERAGE THRU THE LATE AFTN/EARLY EVENING HOURS. NONE OF THESE STORMS HOWEVER ARE EXPECTED TO BE SEVERE DUE TO WEAK SHEAR PROFILES. WHAT THEY WILL BE CAPABLE OF IS HEAVY RAIN AND LOCALIZED FLOODING OF URBAN AND POOR DRAINAGE AREAS BECAUSE OF WEAK STEERING FLOW (ALLOWING FOR STATIONARY/SLOW MOVING CELLS). WILL KEEP SCATTERED TO LIKELY POPS GOING INTO THE EVENING HOURS BEFORE TAPERING TO 20-30% POPS OVERNIGHT. OTW...PTLY TO MSTLY CLOUDY TONIGHT WITH LOWS 65-70 DEG.  
VFR CONDITIONS CONTINUE TO PREVAIL OVER ALL TERMINALS ATTM. ISOLATED SHOWERS HAVE POPPED UP ACROSS THE DELMARVA REGION ALONG A VERY WEAK BACKDOOR COLD FRONT/BOUNDARY. THIS BOUNDARY WILL SETTLE OVER THE REGION DURING THE REST OF TODAY...SLOWLY DISSIPATING TONIGHT. THE COMBINATION OF THIS BOUNDARY...ANY LINGERING CONVECTIVE BOUNDARIES FROM SUN...AND DAYTIME HEATING FROM THIS AFTN WILL LEAD TO POSSIBLE SCT SHRAS/TSTMS...PRIMARILY AT KSBY AND KRIC BTWN 18/1800-2300Z. DUE TO LACK OF LIGHTNING ON SHOWERS ACROSS THE MD/VA EASTERN SHORE AS OF 18/1725Z...HAVE KEPT ONLY VCSH IN THE 18Z TAFS WITH THE INTENT OF AMENDING FOR TSRA WHEN NECESSARY.  IFR CONDITIONS MAY BE POSSIBLE TONIGHT...ESPECIALLY INVOF ERN SHORE (LIGHT ONSHORE WNDS) AND IN OTHER LOCATIONS WHERE RAIN FALLS TODAY. HAVE DROPPED VIS/CIGS AT ALL TAF SITES CLOSER TWD MORNING TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS. ADDITIONAL SHRAS/TSTMS POSSIBLE AGAIN TUE AS A STRONGER FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE REGION IN THE AFTN/EVE. THIS PARTICULAR FRONT EXITS THE COAST TUE NIGHT. SFC HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN THROUGH AT LEAST THU. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MAY RIDE UP THE SE COAST AND JUST OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST LATE IN THE WEEK...BRINGING THE POTENTIAL FOR MORE PRECIP AND REDUCED CIGS/VISIBILITIES.  
THE BACKDOOR COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO PUSH THROUGH THE REGION, NOW SITTING JUST TO THE SOUTHWEST OF PTW-ILG-MIV LINE. LOTS OF SLOW MOVING PULSE TYPE STORMS HAVE FIRED UP RIGHT ALONG THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY AIDED BY SUBSTANTIAL DAYTIME HEATING. THOUGH WE HAD A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SURFACE BASED CAPE AND FAVORABLE LI VALUES THE LACK OF ANY STORM LEVEL STEERING AND SHEAR HAVE NOT ALLOWED FOR MUCH IN THE WAY OF ORGANIZATION OR LONGEVITY. LOTS OF BACK BUILDING HAS OCCURRED WITH THESE STORMS AS UPWIND INSTABILITY IS STILL BE TAPPED AND WITH WELL ABOVE NORMAL, 3-4SD, PWATS AHEAD OF THE FRONT SO VERY HEAVY RAINFALL HAS BEEN THE MAIN CONCERN TODAY. FORTUNATELY OR NOT, HOWEVER YOU LOOK AT IT, WE HAVE BEEN VERY DRY THE PAST 3-4 WEEKS ACROSS THE AREA SO WE HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM BEFORE NEEDING ANY FLASH FLOOD HEADLINES. AT MOST WE HAVE SEEN AROUND 2 INCHES OVER THE COURSE OF AN HOUR OR TWO WHICH IS NOTHING TO SNEEZE AT, BUT UNDER OUR FFG.  THE FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO SLIP SOUTHWEST THIS EVENING AND TONIGHT ALLOWING FOR BETTER STABILITY. THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING WILL ALSO BRING AN END TO ANY SCATTERED CONVECTION. CONTINUED ONSHORE FLOW WILL KEEP US DAMP AND RELATIVELY COOL. SKIES WILL THICKEN AND LOWER, WHERE THEY ALREADY HAVEN`T, AND AREAS OF FOG/DRIZZLE WILL DEVELOP. THERE IS ANOTHER AREA OF RAIN THAT SHOULD PUSH IN LATE TONIGHT FROM THE WEST AS A WEAK WARM FRONT LIFTS TOWARDS THE REGION AND MID-LEVEL SHORTWAVE APPROACHES. WINDS VEER MORE TOWARDS THE SOUTHEAST. TEMPERATURES TONIGHT WILL COOLER THAN PREVIOUS NIGHTS, ESPECIALLY WHERE WE HAVE HAD THE FOG/STRATUS ALL DAY...UPPER-50S TO LOW-60S EXPECTED.  
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS FOR KPHL, KPNE, KTTN, KABE, KRDG, KILG, KMIV, KACY AND SURROUNDING AREAS.  THIS EVENING - TONIGHT...MVFR/IFR TONIGHT BEHIND A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT PUSHING THROUGH TOWARDS THE SOUTHWEST. SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS SOUTH OF MIV THIS EVENING PRIOR TO SUNSET, OTHERWISE NOT MUCH UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT. CONDITIONS LOWER THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AND THE WINDS VEER MORE TOWARDS THE SOUTHEAST...LIFR POSSIBLE.  TUESDAY...MOSTLY IFR TRENDING TOWARDS MVFR. WINDS VEER MORE TOWARDS THE SOUTH-SOUTHWEST TOMORROW AFTERNOON AND THE CIGS SHOULD LIFT A BIT. AMPLE MOISTURE STILL AROUND THE AREA SO NOT ENTIRELY SURE WE BREAK OUT. COLD FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE WEST DURING THE AFTERNOON WITH MORE CHANCES OF SHOWERS/THUNDER.  OUTLOOK...  TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...MAINLY VFR.  
MOST OF THE AREA HAS SEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...WITH NORTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE REGION THE LAST AREA FOR SHOWERS TO BEGIN. WHILE ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO PEAK IN THE LATE AFTERNOON FOLLOWING A DIURNAL CYCLE...SHOWERS AND AT LEAST ISOLATED/SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE EVENING AND INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. ALMOST ALL OF THE RAIN WILL OCCUR IN ADVANCE OF A COLD FRONT THAT AS OF MID AFTERNOON REMAINS BACK ACROSS ILLINOIS AND INDIANA. SKIES SHOULD BEGIN TO CLEAR OUT WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE TUESDAY MORNING...BUT ADDITIONAL CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE BACK IN FROM THE NORTHWEST DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. HIGHS ON TUESDAY WILL REMAIN SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL...ALTHOUGH COOLER THAN TODAY.  
A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA ON TUESDAY. COOLER AND DRY HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN FROM MIDWEEK THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF THE WEEKEND.  
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPED AS THE CONVECTIVE TEMP WAS REACHED LATE THIS MORNING INTO THE AFTERNOON. AREAS OF NERN MD NEAR THE BAY...INCLUDING BALTIMORE CITY...HAVE SINCE STABILIZED WITH TEMPS FALLING BACK INTO THE UPPER 70S. ELSEWHERE...THE CONVECTION CONTINUES WITH TEMPS IN THE 80S...EVEN PUSHING 90 IN SPOTS.  MESOANALYSIS SHOWS THE GREATEST CAPE IS IN THE ONE AREA WHERE THERE HAS BEEN NO CONVECTION...AND NOTHING OF CONSEQUENCE SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO FORM ON THE OUTFLOW PUSHING WEST FROM THE BALTIMORE METRO TOWARD FREDERICK. BUT SOME OF THE HI-RES MODELS DO HINT THAT WHEN THE CONVECTION CURRENTLY OVER ERN WV PROPAGATES INTO THAT HIGHER-CAPE ZONE...IT GETS A BIT OF A BOOST IN INTENSITY. SO THAT WILL NEED TO BE MONITORED TOWARD 00Z.  BLENDED TPW INDICATES PWATS AROUND 1.7 INCHES...SIMILAR TO WHAT MODEL FORECASTS INDICATED FOR 18Z. EARLIER CELLS WEST/SW OF WILMINGTON DELAWARE HAVE NOT MOVED MUCH AND THUS DROPPED AN ESTIMATED 2-3 INCHES OF RAIN. THIS POTENTIAL EXISTS LOCALLY ALSO BUT SO FAR EVERYTHING IS MOVING ALONG AND NOT STAYING IN ANY ONE LOCATION. HI-RES MODELS INDICATE THIS IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE OVERALL.  ACTIVITY WILL DECREASE THIS EVENING WITH THE LOSS OF HEATING...AND MUCH OF THE OVERNIGHT CURRENTLY LOOKS DRY /ALTHOUGH A STRAY SHOWER CANNOT BE RULED OUT AT ANY POINT/. BUT TONIGHT WILL BE UNSEASONABLY WARM AND QUITE HUMID AGAIN WITH LOWS SIMILAR TO...IF NOT A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER THAN...THIS MORNING.  A COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH DURING THE DAY ON TUESDAY. CONVECTIVE TEMPS ARE AGAIN IN THE LOW/MID 80S...BUT THE MITIGATING FACTOR IS TIME-RELATED...WITH THE FRONT THROUGH MOST OF THE AREA BY EARLY AFTERNOON...AND WINDS SHIFTING OUT OF THE WEST...A MAJOR HINDRANCE TO PRECIP DEVELOPMENT. POPS WERE LOWERED WEST OF THE BLUE RIDGE...AND KEPT AT LESS THAN 50/50 WEST OF THE METRO AREAS. PWATS ARE ALSO NOT AS IMPRESSIVE TOMORROW...AND THERE IS MORE STEERING FLOW...SO THE HEAVY RAIN THREAT DECREASES TOO.  
GENERALLY VFR CONDITIONS THROUGH THE TAF PERIOD. CANNOT RULE OUT SOME LOW STRATUS AT BWI/MTN TONIGHT...BUT KEPT CIGS AT MVFR FOR NOW. ALSO CANNOT RULE OUT PATCHY FOG THOUGH OVERCAST SPREADING IN FROM THE WEST MAY KEEP THAT FROM BEING A BIG ISSUE. LOWER VSBYS POSSIBLE IN SCTD TO NUMEROUS SHRA/TSRA THROUGH EARLY EVENING TODAY.  VFR CONDITIONS TUES NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. NW WINDS WED 10-15 KTS WED AFTN...PSBL GUSTS UP TO 20 KTS. SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS PSBL THU NIGHT.  
LIGHT WINDS ON THE WATERS THROUGH TUESDAY. SOME LOCALLY GUSTY WINDS ARE POSSIBLE IN AND NEAR SHRA/TSRA BOTH TODAY AND TUESDAY.  SCA CONDITIONS BCMG MORE LIKELY TUES NIGHT THRU WED MORNING BEHIND THE COLD FRONT ON THE CHESAPEAKE BAY AND MAYBE LOWER TIDAL POTOMAC. SCA GUSTS PSBL THRU WED AFTN...WITH ALL WATERS BCMG SUB- SCA BY WED NIGHT AND REMAINING THAT WAY THROUGH FRIDAY.  
WARMTH...HUMIDITY...AND RAIN CHANCES WILL CONTINUE UNTIL PASSAGE OF A TUESDAY MORNING COLD FRONT.  
RADAR ECHOES STILL REMAIN ISOLATED AS OF NOON. THIS IS LIKELY IN PART DUE TO CONVECTION THAT IS FIRING TO THE SOUTH INTERRUPTING SOME OF THE MOISTURE TRANSPORT. NEVERTHELESS...STILL EXPECT THAT SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE WILL BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. SEVERE WEATHER IS NOT ANTICIPATED GIVEN INSTABILITY AND SHEAR LIMITATIONS.  
AS PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH SHIFTS EAST MONDAY EVENING IT WILL TAKE MOST OF THE DEEP MOISTURE WITH IT. POPS WILL BE IN THE CHANCE CATEGORY AFTER MONDAY EVENING AS MAIN FRONT PUSHES EAST EARLY TUESDAY. DEW POINTS WILL REMAIN A BIT ELEVATED UNTIL FRONT AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH PASS TUESDAY AFTERNOON. MUCH COOLER AND DRIER AIR FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ACROSS REGION.  
HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS ANCHORED OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST THROUGH TUESDAY. A COLD FRONT CROSSES THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY.  
UPDATE AS OF 1030 AM EDT...CLOUDS HAVE THINNED CONSIDERABLY ACROSS THE FA LATE THIS MORNING AND TEMPS HAVE RESPONDED ALREADY BY RUNNING 5-8 DEG HIGHER THAN THIS TIME YESTERDAY. AS SUCH...HAVE ADJUSTED EXPECTED MAX TEMPS UP 1-3 DEGREES IN MOST LOCATIONS. NO REAL STRONG FORCING FOR CONVECTION TODAY. HOWEVER...WITH A LEE (THERMAL) TROUGH IN PLACE THIS AFTERNOON...COUPLED WITH A WEAK BACK DOOR COLD FRONT OVER THE DELMARVA...WILL HAVE TO WATCH FOR SCT AFTN SHWRS/TSTMS. NONE OF THESE STORMS HOWEVER ARE EXPECTED TO BE STRONG/SEVERE DUE TO WEAK SHEAR PROFILES.  PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...LATEST SFC ANALYSIS REVEALS ~1025 MB HI PRES OFF THE CAROLINA CST WITH ~998 MB LO PRES CENTERED NR THE WRN GREAT LAKES STATES. A COLD FRNT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LO WILL SLIDE THRU THE LOCAL AREA LATE TUE/TUE NIGHT. IT WILL BE YET ANOTHER WARM/MOIST DAY AHEAD OF THE FRNT TDA. THE UPR-LEVEL RIDGE WHICH HAS INHIBITED CONVECTION THE LAST COUPLE DAYS WILL STILL BE IN PLACE...THOUGH SOME DAMPENING OF THE RIDGE IS EVIDENT AS A LO- LEVEL THERMAL TROF DEVELOPS AND WILL FORECAST CHANCE POPS OVER MOST OF THE AREA THIS AFTN...UP TO LIKELY FAR NW AREAS. SOME SHRAS/TSTMS MAY CONTINUE INTO TNGT AS WELL SO MAINTAINED 20-30% POPS. OTWS...EXPECT A PRTLY TO MSTLY CLOUDY SKY WITH TEMPS ABOUT 10 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL...HIGHS MAINLY IN THE MID TO UPR 80S...70S TO LWR 80S NR THE CST. LO TEMPS TNGT MAINLY IN THE MID TO UPR 60S.  
THE SURFACE COLD FRONT CROSSES THE AREA TUESDAY AFTN/NIGHT. BULK SHEAR REMAINS MARGINAL AT BEST AND DOWNSLOPE FLOW ALOFT IS LESS THAN IDEAL FOR WIDESPREAD CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, STRONG SFC HEATING PRE-FRONTAL SHOULD YIELD ANOTHER ROUND OF SCATTERED SHOWERS & T-STORMS TUESDAY AFTN/EVE. WENT SLIGHTLY COOLER WITH TEMPS ON TUE, WITH EXPECTATION OF INCREASING AFTN CONVECTION. HIGHS MID 80S NORTH...UPPER 80S TO NR 90 SOUTH.  SFC COOL FRONT SLOWLY PUSHES FARTHER SOUTH WEDNESDAY, EVENTUALLY BECOMING STALLED ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST LATER IN THE DAY. COOL/DRY HIGH PRESSURE BEGINS TO BUILD TOWARD THE AREA FROM THE WEST ON WEDNESDAY, YIELDING A MUCH DRIER/MORE COMFORTABLE DAY ON WEDNESDAY. LOOK FOR HIGH TEMPS INTO THE MID TO UPPER 70S OVER THE EASTERN SHORE TO LOW 80S INLAND...PERHAPS A FEW MID 80S ACROSS FAR SOUTHERN ZONES.  
SHORTWAVE ENERGY IS PROGGED TO SHEAR AS IT TRAVERSES THE GULF STATES ON THU. MEDIUM RANGE GUIDANCE IS IN AGREEMENT INDICATING A WAVE OF LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPING ALONG A FRONTAL BOUNDARY BY MIDDAY THU IN THU NIGHT OVER THE SE STATES IN RESPONSE TO THE SHORTWAVE. BASED ON THE LACK OF SIGNIFICANT UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT AND RATHER FLAT FLOW... BEST PRECIP CHANCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WEAK WAVE WILL STAY SOUTH OF THE LOCAL AREA. HOWEVER...A SLIGHTLY MORE NORTHWARD TREND IN THE SFC LOW TRACKING THRU SOUTH CAROLINA WILL LEND THE NECESSITY FOR SLIGHT CHC POPS ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA THU...THEN MAINLY SERN AREAS THU NIGHT AND FRI. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS OVER THE REGION FOR THE UPCOMING HOLIDAY WEEKEND...RESULTING IN DRY CONDITIONS. COMFORTABLE THU/FRI WITH HIGHS IN THE 70S. WARMING SLIGHTLY NEXT WEEKEND WITH HIGHS IN THE 70S TO LOW 80S. (HIGH TEMPS COOLER AT THE IMMEDIATE COAST THRU THE PERIOD). LOW TEMPS IN THE MID 50S TO MID 60S.  
SFC HI PRES OFF THE SE COAST SLOLY WEAKENS THIS MRNG. LGT SSW WNDS CONTG...W/ WAVES/SEAS AOB 2 FT. WINDS BECOME VRB/ONSHORE MIDDAY/AFTN TODAY AS COMBO WEAK LOW PRESSURE AND VERY WK BACKDOOR CDFNT SETTLES IN OVER MDATLC CSTL WTRS. ADDITIONALLY...THERE WILL BE A HI PROB FOR SHRAS/SCT TSTMS OVR THE WATERS BY THIS AFTN. ANOTHER COLD FRONT PUSHES ACROSS THE WATERS LATE TUE (WITH PSBL SHRAS/TSTMS). WINDS BECOME N-NW POST-FRONTAL TUE NIGHT. ATTM...MARGINAL PROB FOR SCA CONDS TUE NGT INTO WED DUE TO A SURGE OF COOLER/DRIER AIR PUSHES OVR THE WATERS BEHIND THE FRONT. FOR NOW...KEEPING NW WINDS BLO 15-20 KT...AND WAVES AOB 3 FT ON THE BAY...AND SEAS AOB 4 FT. SFC HI PRES BUILDS INTO THE RGN FM THE W WED-THU.  
KAKQ RADAR HAS RETURNED TO SERVICE AND IS FULLY OPERATIONAL.  
A BACKDOOR FRONT MOVING SOUTHWESTWARD THROUGH THE REGION WILL STALL TODAY. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL CROSS THE GREAT LAKES TODAY ON ITS WAY UP THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY. ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO PUSH THROUGH ON TUESDAY. A HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM ENTERING THE NORTHERN PLAINS WILL BEGIN TO BUILD EAST AND REACH THE NORTHERN MID ATLANTIC STATES THURSDAY. A WEAK COLD FRONT IS PREDICTED TO PASS THROUGH THE NORTHEAST ON FRIDAY, THEN ANOTHER HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM BUILDS OVER THE AREA FOR THE START OF THE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND.  
12:30 PM UPDATE: A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT HAS MOVED INTO SOUTHERN NJ NORTHWESTWARD INTO THE LEHIGH VALLEY. THIS FEATURES A SHARP CHANGE IN TEMPERATURES AND AIRMASSES. TO THE WEST OF THE BOUNDARY A MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS HAD LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. HIGH PW VALES WILL ALLOW A POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAINFALL WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES FROM EASTERN MD INTO BERKS PA. MESOSCALE MODELING SHOWS THE POTENTIAL FOR SCATTERED STORMS TO CONTINUE ALONG THE BOUNDARY IN SOUTHERN NJ AS WELL SO THE UPDATE FEATURES HIGHER CHANCES THERE. TEMPERATURES ALSO WERE ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE BOUNDARY LOCATION WITH A VERY SHARP GRADIENT SIMILAR TO RAIN CHANCES TODAY. THE FRONT IS MOVING SOUTHWEST AND CORRESPONDS WITH A STEADY TEMPERATURE DROP ONCE IT PASSES. HIGH TEMPERATURES MAY PUSH 90 IN CONVECTION FREE AREAS SW OF THE BOUNDARY WITH 60`S BEHIND IT TOWARD NYC.  PREVIOUS:    THE FORECAST CHALLENGES INCLUDE THE LOW CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPING ONSHORE FLOW AND THE CONVECTIVE INITIATION AND COVERAGE.  THE BACKDOOR COLD FRONT IS PUSHING THROUGH THE NORTHERN HALF OF NEW JERSEY AND NORTHEASTERN PA AS NOTED BY THE NORTHEAST WIND SHIFT. WITH THE WIND SHIFT COMES THE LOWERING OF DEWPOINTS BUT ALSO A STABLE MARINE LAYER WITH SOME FOG AND STRATUS. CURRENTLY THE STRATUS IS JUST TO THE NORTHEAST OF TRENTON BUT HAS ENVELOPED MOST OF NE NJ AREA AS IT LAGS SEVERAL MILES BEHIND THE FRONT. A LARGE DEWPOINT SPREAD ACROSS THE FRONT WITH NEAR 70F AHEAD AND MID 50S BEHIND IT. THERE IS ALREADY NEARLY 1500J/KG OF SURFACE BASED CAPE AHEAD OF THE FRONT WITH LIS AROUND -2 TO -3C SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHOWERS, WITH DEEPER CONVECTION, MAY GET GOING WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS THOUGH STILL THINKING THE BETTER CHANCES ARE ACROSS OUR WESTERN AND SOUTHERN ZONES THAT HAVE THE GREATER AMOUNT OF HEATING AND MESOSCALE TRIGGERS WITH DIFFERENTIAL HEATING. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT WE HAVE NEARLY REACHED OUR CONVECTIVE TEMPERATURES TODAY SO WE SHOULD SEE A LOT MORE CUMULUS POP OUTSIDE OF THE MARINE LAYER AREAS.  THE FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW A SHALLOW MOIST LAYER DEVELOPING WHICH WILL HELP DEVELOP LOW CLOUDS AND EXPAND THEM WEST AND SOUTHWEST. THIS COULD BE SLOWED THOUGH SOME FARTHER INLAND WITH HEATING DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY. IF THIS OCCURS, A DIFFERENTIAL HEATING BOUNDARY WOULD BE PRESENT AND THAT CAN HELP ENHANCE CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. WHILE THERE WILL BE INSTABILITY, IT WILL BE MORE ELEVATED DUE TO THE ONSHORE FLOW AND FARTHER INLAND SHOULD HAVE THE BEST INSTABILITY. A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL BE AROUND EARLY ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN ZONES. THE AIRMASS IS STILL RATHER MOIST WITH PW VALUES NEAR 1.50 INCHES. THIS COMBINED WITH WEAK ENOUGH FLOW COULD RESULT IN SOME SLOW MOVING CONVECTION THAT PRODUCES LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN. THE INFLUENCE OF THE LOW CLOUDS THANKS TO THE ONSHORE FLOW WILL BE FOLLOWED THROUGH THE DAY AS PLACEMENT OF THE HIGHER POPS CAN THEN BE ADJUSTED BASED ON TRENDS. THE CONVECTION SHOULD BE PULSE VARIETY WITH DOWNPOURS THE MAIN THREAT ATTM.  AS FOR THE HIGH TEMPERATURES, WE USED A MOS BLEND WITH SOME TWEAKS THEREAFTER. THESE COULD BE TRICKY AS THE MARINE LAYER TAKES HOLD, THEREFORE THE WARMEST TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE FARTHER INLAND AND TEMPERATURES MAY THEN FALL SOME THIS AFTERNOON ESPECIALLY CLOSER TO THE COAST.  
THE UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE WILL WEAKEN AND SHIFT OFFSHORE TONIGHT. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE THAT IS STRETCHED DOWN INTO THE MID ATLANTIC TO GRADUALLY WEAKEN AND SHIFT MORE OFFSHORE. A LIGHT ONSHORE FLOW HOWEVER WILL BE MAINTAINED AND THIS WILL RESULT IN A COOLER BOUNDARY LAYER BENEATH WARMER AIR ALOFT. THIS SETS THE STAGE FOR A STRENGTHENING INVERSION AND THEREFORE WIDESPREAD LOW CLOUDS AND SOME FOG ARE ANTICIPATED. THIS COULD RESULT IN SOME DRIZZLE AS WELL.  WE ALSO LOOK TO THE WEST AS AN INCOMING UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL SEND A COLD FRONT OUR WAY LATE. THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR SOME ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND PERHAPS SOME THUNDER TO ARRIVE FROM THE WEST OVERNIGHT. THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME INSTABILITY ESPECIALLY ELEVATED DUE TO THE ANTICIPATED LOW-LEVEL MARINE LAYER IN PLACE. THE MAIN DYNAMICS STILL LOOK TO BE MOSTLY REMOVED FROM OUR AREA, THEREFORE NOT SURE IF THE MODELS ARE OVERDOING THE CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL OVERNIGHT. ONE POSSIBLE ASSISTANCE IS FOR ISENTROPIC UPGLIDE OVER THE MARINE LAYER WHICH COULD ENHANCE SHOWER DEVELOPMENT. OVERALL, WE HELD ONTO A MENTION THROUGH THE NIGHT WITH LIKELY POPS ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE WESTERN ZONES. AS OF NOW, THE THINKING IS WHILE SOME FOG IS ANTICIPATED TONIGHT WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY CARRYING DENSE FOG.  AS FOR THE LOW TEMPERATURES, MOSTLY A NAM/GFS MOS BLEND WAS UTILIZED.  
THE GFS INITIALIZATION AT 500 MB LOOKED BETTER THAN THE WRF/NAM, ESPECIALLY WITH THE CLOSED LOW ENTERING CALIFORNIA. HERE THE NAM IS EITHER TOO PROGRESSIVE OR INTENSE, MAYBE BOTH. THIS BLEEDS DOWN THE ROAD WITH ITS MOST INTENSE SFC LOW SOLUTION ACROSS THE CENTRAL TIER OF THE CONUS. CONVERSELY AT 850MB AND 925MB, IT WAS SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THE GFS AS THE LATTER HAD SOME 1C COLD BIAS ERRORS.  BARRING FARTHER NORTHWARD ADJUSTMENTS OF THE TRACK OF THE CENTRAL CONUS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM, THE BEST CHANCE FOR PCPN IN THE LONG TERM COMES ON TUESDAY. IT LOOKS LIKE MODEL TIMING OVERALL HAS SLOWED CLOSER TO WHAT THE 12Z NAM HAD. A DOUBLE BARREL LOOK AT PCPN CHANCES AS THERE IS AN INITIAL SHOT WITH THE FIRST SHORT WAVE IN THE MORNING AND THEN A POSSIBLE REBOOT DURING THE AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING. THE AFTERNOON PCPN WAVE WILL DEPEND UPON HOW QUICKLY THE MORNING SHOT CAN MOVE THROUGH AND HOW QUICKLY CAN THE RESIDUAL CLOUDS BURN AWAY. THAT REMAINS THE IF FOR TUESDAY BECAUSE AS THE DAY PROGRESSES, INGREDIENTS FOR STRONGER THUNDERSTORMS BECOME MORE FAVORABLE. AS SWODY2 STATED THE ISSUE MAY BE IS IT TOO LATE? THE PREDICTED BULK SHEAR AND MID LEVEL DRY AIR (DCAPES GETTING CLOSE TO 1K JOULES) AS WELL AS THE ARRIVAL OF THE ENTRANCE REGION OF THE 250MB JET ARE ALL PRIMING IF THEY CAN ARRIVE A COUPLE OF HOURS SOONER. ALSO IF THE MORNING WAVE OF CLOUDS DISSIPATE IN TIME.  FOR NOW CONFIDENCE IS TOO LOW TO ADDED ENHANCED WORDING TO GRIDS AND WE WILL CONTINUE MENTION IN HWO. NOTE THAT THE NORTHERN PART OF OUR CWA IS IN A MARGINAL RISK FOR SEVERE STORMS AND THIS LINES UP WELL WITH THE GFS`S PREDICTED SYNOPTIC SCALE DEEPER MID LEVEL QVEC CONVERGENCE AS WELL AS USING AS A PROXY MODEL CONSENSUS OF RELATIVELY HIGHEST SHERBS VALUES. GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR MAX TEMPS AS HIGH AS THE UPPER 80S IN OUR CWA, WE DID BUMP UP MAX TEMPS, WE ARE CLOSER TO THE HIGHER STAT GUIDANCE.  NO BIG CHANGE TO TUESDAY NIGHT FCST AS WE KEPT THE CHANCE OF EVENING SHOWERS AND TSTMS (EAST) IN. BEST SHORT WAVE OF THE DAY MAY BE A FEW HOURS TOO LATE. THEN COOLER AND DRIER WEATHER WILL ARRIVE.  WEDNESDAY, A COOLER AND MUCH DRIER DAY. A DECENT GRADIENT FOR THE SECOND HALF OF MAY FOR IT TO BE BREEZY. WHILE THE CONVECTIVE TEMP IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE REACHED SOUTH, THE NAM HAS MOISTURE PREDICTED TO GET TRAPPED UNDERNEATH THE SUBSIDENCE INVERSION NORTH. THE HIGHER RESOLUTION NAM IS NOT AS BULLISH. REGARDLESS, WE MAY STILL BE TOO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE NORTH. BASED ON FCST 925S WE LIKE HIGHER GFS MOS MAX TEMPS BETTER.  WEAK HIGH PRESSURE IS PREDICTED TO BUILD EAST INTO OUR CWA WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. SHORT WAVES IN THE WESTERLY FLOW SHOULD BRING/HELP DEVELOP SOME CLOUDINESS. THE MODEL SPREAD ON THE SOLUTIONS FOR THIS PERIOD HAS WIDENED WITH THE NAM BRINGING A FULL BOAR GRASS LOVING RAIN GENERATING SYNOPTIC SCALE LOW TOWARD OUR CWA WHILE THE GFS IS PRETTY MUCH STATING LOW, WHAT LOW? THIS ALMOST HAS A WINTER TIME FEEL TO IT AS TO HOW MUCH CAN THE 500MB TROF SHARPEN TO GENERATE A STRONGER LOW AND BACK PCPN INTO OUR CWA. WHILE THE GFS DOES HAVE GEFS SUPPORT FOR A MORE MUTED SOLUTION, THE OP NAM (IF THIS WAS WINTER, PUTTING A LOW TOO DEEP INTO THE COLD AIR?) IS PRETTY MUCH AN OUTLIER VS THE 21Z SREF MEMBERS. THE OTHER MEDIUM RANGE MODELS (UKMET, ECMWF, NOGAPS AND JMA) ARE CLUSTERED ALMOST AT A COMPROMISE MID POINT BETWEEN THE GFS AND NAM WHICH IS WHERE WE ARE GOING WITH THIS PACKAGE. WE DID INCREASE THE CLOUDS AND ADDED LOW CHANCE POPS SOUTH FOR THURSDAY DAY.  AS THE AFOREMENTIONED 500MB TROF MOVES THROUGH THE NORTHEAST WHAT APPEARS TO BE A DRY CFP IS STILL EXPECTED ON FRIDAY. THIS WILL THEN GET THE BALL ROLLING TO A PLEASANT START TO THE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND. SATURDAY SHOULD BE COOLER THAN AVERAGE (MEX MOS THOUGH LOOKS TOO LOW) WITH NEAR NORMAL TEMPS ARRIVING ON SUNDAY. NO PCPN IS PREDICTED FOR THE END OF THE LONG TERM, ALTHOUGH LATEST GUIDANCE SUGGEST A CHANCE EXISTS ON A WARMER MEMORIAL DAY ITSELF.  
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS FOR KPHL, KPNE, KTTN, KABE, KRDG, KILG, KMIV, KACY AND SURROUNDING AREAS.  TODAY...MVFR CEILINGS MOVING IN FROM EAST TO WEST /SOME IFR OR LOWER CEILINGS POSSIBLE/. OUR CONFIDENCE IS LOWER THE FARTHER WEST. SOME SHOWERS AND A FEW AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS, WITH THE GREATEST COVERAGE PROBABLY NEAR AND TO THE WEST AND SOUTH OF KPHL. WINDS BECOMING EASTERLY UP TO 10 KNOTS BEHIND A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT BEFORE TURNING SOUTHEAST.  TONIGHT...MVFR/IFR CEILINGS WITH AN ONSHORE FLOW AND INCREASED LOW- LEVEL MOISTURE. SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED, WITH THE GREATEST CHANCE MOSTLY WEST OF KPHL. SOME FOG IS EXPECTED ESPECIALLY OVERNIGHT. WINDS LIGHT FROM THE EAST OR SOUTHEAST.  OUTLOOK... TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...LOW CLOUDS DISSIPATE IN THE MORNING, BUT MVFR AND IFR STILL POSSIBLE UNDER ANY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. COLD FRONT/NW WIND SHIFT PUSHES OVER THE REGION AT NIGHT.  WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...VFR. SOME GUSTY NORTHWEST WINDS ON WEDNESDAY.  THURSDAY...VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED, LOWEST CONFIDENCE SOUTHERN AIRPORTS AS THEY WILL BE CLOSEST TO TRACK OF TRANSCONTINENTAL LOW.  THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...MOSTLY VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED.  
A BACKDOOR FRONT WILL WORKS ITS WAY SOUTHWESTWARD TODAY. THIS WILL TURN THE WINDS TO EASTERLY WITH SOME INCREASE, HOWEVER THE CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CRITERIA THROUGH TONIGHT. SOME FOG SHOULD OCCUR IN THE WAKE OF THE BACKDOOR FRONT THROUGH TONIGHT, HOWEVER AS OF NOW WE ARE NOT ANTICIPATING WIDESPREAD DENSE FOG. SOME SHOWERS AND A THUNDERSTORM WILL BE AROUND THROUGH TONIGHT, HOWEVER MOST OF THE ACTIVITY SHOULD BE INLAND.  OUTLOOK... TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...SUB SCA CONDITIONS ARE MOSTLY EXPECTED. HOWEVER...GUSTY WINDS WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE VICINITY OF ANY THUNDERSTORMS.  WEDNESDAY...WINDS AND SEAS SHOULD REMAIN BELOW SCA CRITERIA. A FEW GUSTS NEAR OR ABOVE 20 KT ARE POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY.  WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY....WINDS AND SEAS SHOULD REMAIN BELOW SCA CRITERIA.  
THE FORECAST CHALLENGES INCLUDE THE LOW CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPING ONSHORE FLOW AND THE CONVECTIVE INITIATION AND COVERAGE.  THE BACKDOOR COLD FRONT IS PUSHING THROUGH THE NORTHERN HALF OF NEW JERSEY AND NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA AS NOTED BY THE NORTHEAST WIND SHIFT. WITH THE WIND SHIFT COMES THE LOWERING OF DEWPOINTS BUT ALSO A STABLE MARINE LAYER WITH SOME FOG AND STRATUS. CURRENTLY THE STRATUS IS JUST TO THE NORTHEAST OF TRENTON BUT HAS ENVELOPED MOST OF NE NJ AREA AS IT LAGS SEVERAL MILES BEHIND THE FRONT. A LARGE DEWPOINT SPREAD ACROSS THE FRONT WITH NEAR 70F AHEAD AND MID 50S BEHIND IT. THERE IS ALREADY NEARLY 1500J/KG OF SURFACE BASED CAPE AHEAD OF THE FRONT WITH LIS AROUND -2 TO -3C SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHOWERS, WITH DEEPER CONVECTION, MAY GET GOING WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS THOUGH STILL THINKING THE BETTER CHANCES ARE ACROSS OUR WESTERN AND SOUTHERN ZONES THAT HAVE THE GREATER AMOUNT OF HEATING AND MESOSCALE TRIGGERS WITH DIFFERENTIAL HEATING. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT WE HAVE NEARLY REACHED OUR CONVECTIVE TEMPERATURES TODAY SO WE SHOULD SEE A LOT MORE CUMULUS POP OUTSIDE OF THE MARINE LAYER AREAS.  THE FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW A SHALLOW MOIST LAYER DEVELOPING WHICH WILL HELP DEVELOP LOW CLOUDS AND EXPAND THEM WEST AND SOUTHWEST. THIS COULD BE SLOWED THOUGH SOME FARTHER INLAND WITH HEATING DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY. IF THIS OCCURS, A DIFFERENTIAL HEATING BOUNDARY WOULD BE PRESENT AND THAT CAN HELP ENHANCE CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. WHILE THERE WILL BE INSTABILITY, IT WILL BE MORE ELEVATED DUE TO THE ONSHORE FLOW AND FARTHER INLAND SHOULD HAVE THE BEST INSTABILITY. A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL BE AROUND EARLY ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN ZONES. THE AIRMASS IS STILL RATHER MOIST WITH PW VALUES NEAR 1.50 INCHES. THIS COMBINED WITH WEAK ENOUGH FLOW COULD RESULT IN SOME SLOW MOVING CONVECTION THAT PRODUCES LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN. THE INFLUENCE OF THE LOW CLOUDS THANKS TO THE ONSHORE FLOW WILL BE FOLLOWED THROUGH THE DAY AS PLACEMENT OF THE HIGHER POPS CAN THEN BE ADJUSTED BASED ON TRENDS. THE CONVECTION SHOULD BE PULSE VARIETY WITH DOWNPOURS THE MAIN THREAT ATTM.  AS FOR THE HIGH TEMPERATURES, WE USED A MOS BLEND WITH SOME TWEAKS THEREAFTER. THESE COULD BE TRICKY AS THE MARINE LAYER TAKES HOLD, THEREFORE THE WARMEST TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE FARTHER INLAND AND TEMPERATURES MAY THEN FALL SOME THIS AFTERNOON ESPECIALLY CLOSER TO THE COAST.  
VFR CONDS PREVAIL OVR THE TERMINALS ATTM. ISOLD VERY LGT SHRAS INVOF KPHF/KORF INTO MID MRNG. VERY WK BACKDOOR CDFNT SETTLES OVR THE RGN BY THIS AFTN...SLOLY DISSIPATING TNGT. COMBO OF THAT BNDRY...ANY LINGERING CONVECTIVE BOUNDARIES FM SUN...AND DAYTIME HEATING LEAD TO PSBL SCT SHRAS/TSTMS...MNLY AFTN 18-20Z/18. HWVR...DUE TO TIMING AND LOCATION UNCERTAINTIES...HAVE LEFT OUT OF 12Z/18 TAFS. PTNTL AGAIN TNGT FOR IFR CONDS...ESP INVOF ERN SHORE (LGT ONSHORE WNDS) AND IN OTHER LOCATIONS WHERE RA FALLS TDA. ADDITIONAL SHRAS/TSTMS PSBL AGAIN TUE AS A STRONGER FRONT MOVES ACRS THE RGN IN THE AFTN/EVE. THAT FRONT EXITS THE CST TUE NGT. SFC HI PRES BUILDS IN FOR MOST OF THE REST OF THE WEEK.  
KAKQ RADAR REMAINS OFFLINE WITH AN AZIMUTH MOTOR ISSUE. TECHNICIANS EXPECT TO REPLACE THE MOTOR MONDAY MORNING.  
HIGH PRESSURE IS POSITIONED OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST. A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER PENNSYLVANIA WILL APPROACH THE MID ATLANTIC TODAY. A STRONGER COLD FRONT WILL MOVE IN FROM THE WEST TUESDAY. COOLER AND DRY HIGH PRESSURE WILL FOLLOW FROM THE MIDWEEK UNTIL THE EARLY PART OF THE WEEKEND.  
WEAK SFC BOUNDARY STILL SITTING ACROSS ERN PA AND NJ...NOT MAKING ANY PROGRESS IN ANY DIRECTION. CLOSER TO HOME...THE HOT AND HUMID AIRMASS REMAINS...WITH DEWPOINTS AROUND OR ABOVE 70 AND TEMPS ALREADY PUSHING 80 WHERE THERE HAS BEEN MORE SUNSHINE.  CONVECTIVE TEMP OFF THE 12Z SOUNDINGS IS 83-84 DEGREES...A TEMP THAT WILL EASILY BE EXCEEDED IN MOST AREAS. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW ABOUT 1000 J/KG OF CAPE THIS AFTERNOON WITH VIRTUALLY ZERO SHEAR. MODEL PWATS JUMP OVER 1.75 INCHES...WHICH IS NEAR MAXIMUM FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. THESE PARAMETERS LEND THEMSELVES TO A POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAIN BUT NOT PARTICULARLY SEVERE WEATHER. THE GOOD NEWS WITH RESPECT TO FLOOD POTENTIAL IS THAT IT HAS BEEN FAIRLY DRY AND FFG IS QUITE HIGH...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF OUR FORECAST AREA. WILL KEEP AN EYE OUT BUT NO NEED FOR A FLOOD WATCH.  NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE FORECAST FOR TODAY.  
SHOWERS AND A COUPLE OF THUNDERSTORMS WILL AFFECT THE REGION MAINLY THIS EVENING WHILE THE BACKDOOR BNDRY WASHES OUT. A WARM NGT W/ LOWS IN MOST OF THE AREA IN THE 60S...L70S IN THE CITIES.  A CD FNT XTNDG FM MN TO KS WILL MOVE INTO THE MID ATLC DURG THE 1ST HALF OF TUE GENERATING ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BEFORE COOLER AND DRIER AIR PUSHES INTO THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT.  
RETURN TO MORE SPRING-LIKE WX WED WITH MUCH DRIER/COOLER AIR MOVING INTO AREA. LOW TEMPS WED MORNING WILL BE MAINLY IN 50S...EXCEPT IN METRO AREAS (L60S). MAX TEMPS WED ALSO VERY NICE...WITH M60S WEST...U60S/L70S CENTRAL...AND M70S SOUTHEAST PARTS OF CWA UNDER MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. ONLY WX CONCERNS WED WOULD BE GUSTY WINDS POSSIBLE NEAR BAY THROUGH MOST OF THE DAY.  00Z MODEL GUIDANCE INCONSISTENT WITH REGARDS TO POTENTIAL WEAK SFC LP MOVING TO OUR SOUTH LATE WED OR THU. PRECIP SIGNAL GENERALLY A RESULT OF LIFT FROM FAVORABLE LOCATION OF RRQ OF UPPER JET. 00Z NAM MOST AGGRESSIVE WITH QPF TOTALS...BUT BELIEVE NAM IS LIKELY OVERDONE DUE TO LIMITED MOISTURE AND UNFAVORABLE TRACK OF SFC LP. FOR NOW...KEPT POPS LOW WITH ONLY SLT CHC FOR SHOWERS NORTH AND CHC SOUTH.  THINGS QUIET DOWN AGAIN AFTER THU...WITH A SLOW WARMING TREND AND A DRY FORECAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS HP SETTLES INTO THE REGION. BY SUN RETURN FLOW WILL HELP PUSH TEMPS BACK INTO THE U70S/L80S...WITH LOW TEMPS SUNDAY NIGHT INTO THE 60S DUE TO INCREASING MOISTURE.  
SHRA/TSRA DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON AND COULD AFFECT ALL TERMINALS. CIGS SHOULD REMAIN VFR BUT HEAVY RAIN COULD DROP VSBYS. FOR NOW THIS IS NOT MENTIONED IN TAFS. WILL REASSESS FOR 18Z ISSUANCE. MODELS ARE NOT BULLISH ON FOG POTENTIAL TONIGHT...BUT WHERE IT RAINS THE POTENTIAL DOES EXIST.  RW/TRW WL AGN BE PSBL TUE...MOSTLY DURG LATE MRNG AND AFTN.  VFR CONDITIONS WEDNESDAY. LOW CHC FOR IFR CONDS IF SHWRS DEVELOP THU...WITH BEST CHCS AT CHO.  
WINDS SHOULD REMAIN BELOW SCA CRITERIA TODAY. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL IMPACT THE WATERS WHICH MAY REQUIRE THE ISSUANCE OF SMWS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  NO MARINE HAZARDS MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY.  SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS POSSIBLE TUE NGT THROUGH WED AFTERNOON. NO MARINE CONCERNS THU.  
IAD TIED A RECORD HIGH MIN TEMP YDA. UNUSUALLY WARM WEATHER IS FORECAST THE NEXT FEW NIGHTS. BELOW IS A LIST OF RECORD HIGH MINIMUM TEMPERATURES FOR MAY 18TH AND 19TH.  SITE...MAY 18TH.........MAY 19TH.........  DCA....68 (1995*).......70 (1986/1962)... BWI....68 (1900/1896)...75 (1877)........

WITH 945AM UPDATE...EASED OFF PRECIPITATION CHANCES DURING THE MORNING HOURS CONSIDERING HOW LIMITED CURRENT COVERAGE IS ON THE RADAR. ALSO MADE MINOR TWEAKS TO HOURLY TEMPERATURE AND SKY COVER TRENDS.  PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...INCREASING SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM CHANCES WERE MAINTAINED TODAY AS RIDGING ERODES WITH THE ADVANCE OF AN UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT OUT OF THE MID WEST. HIGH TEMPERATURES WERE ADJUSTED MINIMALLY USING A BLEND OF GUIDANCE.  SEVERE WEATHER IS NOT ANTICIPATED GIVEN INSTABILITY AND SHEAR LIMITATIONS.  
LATEST SFC ANALYSIS REVEALS ~1025 MB HI PRES OFF THE CAROLINA CST WITH ~998 MB LO PRES CENTERED NR THE WRN GREAT LAKES STATES. A COLD FRNT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LO WILL SLIDE THRU THE LOCAL AREA LATE TUE/TUE NIGHT. IT WILL BE YET ANOTHER WARM/MOIST DAY AHEAD OF THE FRNT TDA. THE UPR-LEVEL RIDGE WHICH HAS INHIBITED CONVECTION THE LAST COUPLE DAYS WILL STILL BE IN PLACE...THOUGH SOME DAMPENING OF THE RIDGE IS EVIDENT AS A LO-LEVEL THERMAL TROF DEVELOPS AND WILL FORECAST CHANCE POPS OVER MOST OF THE AREA THIS AFTN...UP TO LIKELY FAR NW AREAS. SOME SHRAS/TSTMS MAY CONTINUE INTO TNGT AS WELL SO MAINTAINED 20-30% POPS. OTWS...EXPECT A PRTLY TO MSTLY CLOUDY SKY WITH TEMPS ABOUT 10 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL...HIGHS MAINLY IN THE MID TO UPR 80S...70S TO LWR 80S NR THE CST. LO TEMPS TNGT MAINLY IN THE MID TO UPR 60S.  
NO MAJOR CHANGES FOR THE DAWN UPDATE. PREVIOUS...INCREASING SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM CHANCES WERE MAINTAINED TODAY AS RIDGING ERODES WITH THE ADVANCE OF AN UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT OUT OF THE MID WEST. HIGH TEMPERATURES WERE ADJUSTED MINIMALLY USING A BLEND OF GUIDANCE.  SEVERE WEATHER IS NOT ANTICIPATED GIVEN INSTABILITY AND SHEAR LIMITATIONS.  
VFR CONDS PREVAIL OVR THE TERMINALS ATTM. ISOLD VERY LGT SHRAS INVOF KPHF/KORF INTO MID MRNG. VERY WK BACKDOOR CDFNT SETTLES OVR THE RGN BY THIS AFTN...SLOLY DISSIPATING TNGT. COMBO OF THAT BNDRY...ANY LINGERING CONVECTIVE BOUNDARIES FM SUN...AND DAYTIME HEATING LEAD TO PSBL SCT SHRAS/TSTMS...MNLY AFTN 18-20Z/18. HWVR...DUE TO TIMING AND LOCATION UNCERTAINTIES...HAVE LEFT OUT OF 12Z/18 TAFS. ADDITIONAL SHRAS/TSTMS POSSIBLE AGAIN TUESDAY AS A STRONGER FRONT MOVES ACRS THE RGN IN THE AFTN/EVE. THAT FRONT EXITS THE CST TUE NGT. SFC HI PRES BUILDS IN FOR MOST OF THE REST OF THE WEEK.  
FOR THE LATEST UPDATE, REMOVED ANY THUNDER MENTION FOR LATER THIS MORNING AS IT APPEARS THE BEST THUNDER CHC IS THIS AFTERNOON. THE SKY COVER WAS ADJUSTED UPWARD A BIT, AND THE HOURLY GRIDS WERE TWEAK BASED ON THE LATEST OBSERVATIONS. SOME FOG IS AROUND, BUT THIS SHOULD BE MOSTLY IN OPEN FIELDS AND PROBABLY CLOSE TO THE GROUND. THE BACKDOOR FRONT IS MAKING SOUTHWESTERLY PROGRESS, WITH IT NOW THROUGH NEW YORK CITY. STRATUS LOOKS TO LAG A LITTLE BEHIND THE ACTUAL FRONT.  OTHERWISE, THE SYNOPTIC SETUP IS COMPRISED OF AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE THAT SLIDES ACROSS OUR AREA DURING THE COURSE OF TODAY. THIS FEATURE WILL NARROW AS A TROUGH IMPINGES ON IT FROM THE WEST AND ANOTHER ONE IS TO ITS EAST/NORTHEAST. THE LATTER WILL HELP TO PROPEL A BACKDOOR FRONT OUR WAY, WHICH WILL BE ENHANCED BY SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN NEW ENGLAND AND THEN EXPANDING SOUTHWESTWARD DURING TODAY. THE FORECAST CHALLENGES INCLUDE THE LOW CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPING ONSHORE FLOW AND THE CONVECTIVE INITIATION AND COVERAGE.  THERE ARE SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES IN THE MODEL GUIDANCE REGARDING THE PASSAGE OF THE BACKDOOR FRONT, AND WE GENERALLY SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE. THIS BRINGS THE BOUNDARY THROUGH MUCH OF THE AREA BY LATE MORNING, WITH AN EASTERLY FLOW IN ITS WAKE. THE FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW A SHALLOW MOIST LAYER DEVELOPING WHICH WILL HELP DEVELOP LOW CLOUDS AND EXPAND THEM WEST AND SOUTHWEST. THIS COULD BE SLOWED THOUGH SOME FARTHER INLAND WITH HEATING DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY. IF THIS OCCURS, A DIFFERENTIAL HEATING BOUNDARY WOULD BE PRESENT AND THAT CAN HELP ENHANCE CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. WHILE THERE WILL BE INSTABILITY, IT WILL BE MORE ELEVATED DUE TO THE ONSHORE FLOW AND FARTHER INLAND SHOULD HAVE THE BEST INSTABILITY. A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL BE AROUND EARLY ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN ZONES. THE AIRMASS IS STILL RATHER MOIST WITH PW VALUES NEAR 1.50 INCHES. THIS COMBINED WITH WEAK ENOUGH FLOW COULD RESULT IN SOME SLOW MOVING CONVECTION THAT PRODUCES LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN. THE INFLUENCE OF THE LOW CLOUDS THANKS TO THE ONSHORE FLOW WILL BE FOLLOWED THROUGH THE DAY AS PLACEMENT OF THE HIGHER POPS CAN THEN BE ADJUSTED BASED ON TRENDS. THE CONVECTION SHOULD BE PULSE VARIETY WITH DOWNPOURS THE MAIN THREAT ATTM.  WHILE SOME DRIZZLE COULD DEVELOP WITH THE ONSHORE FLOW ESPECIALLY AT THE ONSET AND CLOSER TO THE COAST, THE FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW THE MOIST LAYER RATHER SHALLOW AND THEREFORE WE WILL NOT CARRY A MENTION ATTM. OTHERWISE, LOTS OF CLOUDS ARE ANTICIPATED THROUGH THE DAY WITH SOME INCREASE IN CONVECTION ESPECIALLY FROM ABOUT THE PHILADELPHIA METRO ON WEST AND SOUTH /FARTHER NORTH AND EAST MAY BE MAINLY RAIN-FREE DUE TO MORE STABLE AFFECTS FROM THE ONSHORE FLOW/.  AS FOR THE HIGH TEMPERATURES, WE USED A MOS BLEND WITH SOME TWEAKS THEREAFTER. THESE COULD BE TRICKY AS THE MARINE LAYER TAKES HOLD, THEREFORE THE WARMEST TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE FARTHER INLAND AND TEMPERATURES MAY THEN FALL SOME THIS AFTERNOON ESPECIALLY CLOSER TO THE COAST.  
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS FOR KPHL, KPNE, KTTN, KABE, KRDG, KILG, KMIV, KACY AND SURROUNDING AREAS.  TODAY...SOME LOCAL MVFR OR LOWER CONDITIONS EARLY DUE TO FOG, OTHERWISE VFR GIVING WAY TO MVFR CEILINGS FROM EAST TO WEST /SOME IFR OR LOWER CEILINGS POSSIBLE/. OUR CONFIDENCE IS LOWER THE FARTHER WEST. SOME SHOWERS AND A FEW AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS, WITH THE GREATEST COVERAGE PROBABLY NEAR AND TO THE WEST AND SOUTH OF KPHL. MOSTLY LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS EARLY, THEN BECOMING EASTERLY UP TO 10 KNOTS BEFORE TURNING SOUTHEAST.  TONIGHT...MVFR/IFR CEILINGS WITH AN ONSHORE FLOW AND INCREASED LOW- LEVEL MOISTURE. SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED, WITH THE GREATEST CHANCE MOSTLY WEST OF KPHL. SOME FOG IS EXPECTED ESPECIALLY OVERNIGHT. WINDS LIGHT FROM THE EAST OR SOUTHEAST.  OUTLOOK... TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...LOW CLOUDS DISSIPATE IN THE MORNING, BUT MVFR AND IFR STILL POSSIBLE UNDER ANY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. COLD FRONT/NW WIND SHIFT PUSHES OVER THE REGION AT NIGHT.  WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...VFR. SOME GUSTY NORTHWEST WINDS ON WEDNESDAY.  THURSDAY...VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED, LOWEST CONFIDENCE SOUTHERN AIRPORTS AS THEY WILL BE CLOSEST TO TRACK OF TRANSCONTINENTAL LOW.  THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...MOSTLY VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED.  
HIGH PRESSURE IS POSITIONED OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST. A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER PENNSYLVANIA WILL APPROACH THE MID ATLANTIC TODAY. A STRONGER COLD FRONT WILL MOVE IN FROM THE WEST TUESDAY. COOL AND DRY HIGH PRESSURE WILL FOLLOW FROM THE MIDDWEEK UNTIL THE EARLY PART OF THE WEEKEND.  
WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON FOG PTNL...ESPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL SHEN VLLY. ATTM OBS SHOWING ONLY A FEW SPOTS W/ LOW VSBY. TRAFFIC CAMS NOT LOOKING BAD EITHER.  BACKDOOR CD FNT IS REALLY QUITE WK. W.V. IMGRY MAY BE A GOOD WAY TO FIND IT...WHICH SHOWS A BNDRY OVR CENTRAL NJ/NERN PA. THE EURO 850-1000 THCKNS ALSO SEEM TO HV A HANDLE ON THIS...AND IT DOESN`T PROJECT MUCH SWD MVMNT. THIS WL KEEP MID ATLC IN WARM MOIST AIR MASS. MDLS ARE PROJECTING HIGH POPS...LKLYS AND EVEN CATS. GNRLY AS WE ENTER THE CNVTV SEASON IT BECOMES HARDER TO FCST PCPN CHCS THAT HIGH W/O A MAJOR SYSTEM APRCHG - PRIMARILY A STRNG CD FNT W/ A LN OF STORMS ON THE RGNL RDR. NEITHER OF THESE IS OCCURRING ATTM SO HV FOCUSED ON THE AFTN/EVE AS BEING THE BEST TIME FOR RW/TSTMS.  THE WIND FIELD IS VERY WK TDA. W/O SHEAR THE PSBLTY OF SVR STORMS IS LOW-TO-NON EXISTANT. SOME CELLS THAT DO DVLP COULD PRODUCE HVY RAFL...PARTLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE WIND WL BE SO LGT THAT STORMS WON`T BE MOVG.  HIGH TEMPS WL REACH THE U80S.    
SHOWERS AND A COUPLE OF THUNDERSTORMS WILL AFFECT THE REGION TONIGHT AS A FRONT WHILE THE BACKDOOR BNDRY WASHES OUT. A WARM NGT W/ LOWS IN MOST OF THE AREA IN THE 60S...L70S IN THE CITIES.  A CD FNT XTNDG FM MN TO KS WILL MOVE INTO THE MID ATLC DURG THE 1ST HALF OF TUE GENERATING ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BEFORE COOLER AND DRIER AIR PUSHES INTO THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT.  
RETURN TO MORE SPRING-LIKE WX WED WITH MUCH DRIER/COOLER AIR MOVING INTO AREA. LOW TEMPS WED MORNING WILL BE MAINLY IN 50S...EXCEPT IN METRO AREAS (L60S).

BY SUN RETURN FLOW WILL HELP PUSH TEMPS BACK INTO THE U70S/L80S...WITH LOW TEMPS SUNDAY NIGHT INTO THE 60S DUE TO INCREASING MOISTURE.

NO MARINE HAZARDS MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY.  SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS POSSIBLE TUE NGT THROUGH WED AFTERNOON. NO MARINE CONCERNS THU.  
VFR CONDS PREVAIL OVR THE TERMINALS ATTM. LO PROB FOR IFR CONDS (MNLY FOG) DUE TO PCPN SUN AFTN...ESP AT KPHF UNTIL SHORTLY AFT SUNRISE. VERY WK BACKDOOR CDFNT SETTLES OVR THE RGN BY THIS AFTN...SLOLY DISSIPATING TNGT.

THAT FRONT EXITS THE CST TUE NGT. SFC HI PRES BUILDS IN FOR MOST OF THE REST OF THE WEEK.  
A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT MOVING SOUTHWESTWARD THROUGH THE REGION WILL STALL TODAY. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL CROSS THE GREAT LAKES TODAY ON ITS WAY UP THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY. ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO PUSH THROUGH ON TUESDAY. A HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM ENTERING THE NORTHERN PLAINS WILL BEGIN TO BUILD EAST AND REACH THE NORTHERN MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES THURSDAY. A WEAK COLD FRONT IS PREDICTED TO PASS THROUGH THE NORTHEAST ON FRIDAY. TO BE FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM BUILDING OVER THE AREA FOR THE START OF THE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND.  
THE SYNOPTIC SETUP IS COMPRISED OF AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE THAT SLIDES ACROSS OUR AREA DURING THE COURSE OF TODAY. THIS FEATURE WILL NARROW AS A TROUGH IMPINGES ON IT FROM THE WEST AND ANOTHER ONE IS TO ITS EAST/NORTHEAST. THE LATTER WILL HELP TO PROPEL A BACKDOOR FRONT OUR WAY, WHICH WILL BE ENHANCED BY SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN NEW ENGLAND AND THEN EXPANDING SOUTHWESTWARD DURING TODAY. THE FORECAST CHALLENGES INCLUDE THE LOW CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPING ONSHORE FLOW AND THE CONVECTIVE INITIATION AND COVERAGE.  THERE ARE SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES IN THE MODEL GUIDANCE REGARDING THE PASSAGE OF THE BACKDOOR FRONT. WE GENERALLY SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE AND THE QUICKER GUIDANCE COULD BE RIGHT. THIS BRINGS THE BOUNDARY THROUGH MUCH OF THE AREA BY LATE MORNING, WITH AN EASTERLY FLOW IN ITS WAKE. THE FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW A RATHER SHALLOW MOIST LAYER DEVELOPING WHICH WILL HELP DEVELOP LOW CLOUDS AND EXPAND THEM WEST AND SOUTHWEST /THIS IS IN PROGRESS ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN NEW ENGLAND AND EASTERN LONG ISLAND AS OF 07Z/. THIS COULD BE SLOWED THOUGH SOME MORE INLAND WITH HEATING DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY. IF THIS OCCURS, A DIFFERENTIAL HEATING BOUNDARY WOULD BE PRESENT AND THAT CAN HELP ENHANCE CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. WHILE THERE WILL BE INSTABILITY, IT WILL BE MORE ELEVATED DUE TO THE ONSHORE FLOW AND FARTHER INLAND SHOULD HAVE THE BEST INSTABILITY. A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL BE AROUND EARLY ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SOUTHWESTERN ZONES. THE AIRMASS IS STILL RATHER MOIST WITH PW VALUES NEAR 1.50 INCHES. THIS COMBINED WITH WEAK ENOUGH FLOW COULD RESULT IN SOME SLOW MOVING CONVECTION THAT PRODUCES LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN. THE INFLUENCE OF THE LOW CLOUDS THANKS TO THE ONSHORE FLOW WILL BE FOLLOWED THROUGH THE DAY AS PLACEMENT OF THE HIGHER POPS CAN THEN BE ADJUSTED BASED ON TRENDS. THE CONVECTION SHOULD BE PULSE VARIETY WITH DOWNPOURS THE MAIN THREAT ATTM.  WHILE SOME DRIZZLE COULD DEVELOP WITH THE ONSHORE FLOW ESPECIALLY AT THE ONSET, THE FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW THE MOIST LAYER SHOULD BE RATHER SHALLOW AND THEREFORE WE WILL NOT CARRY A MENTION ATTM. OTHERWISE, LOTS OF CLOUDS ARE ANTICIPATED THROUGH THE DAY WITH SOME INCREASE IN CONVECTION ESPECIALLY FROM ABOUT THE PHILADELPHIA METRO ON WEST AND SOUTH /FARTHER NORTH AND EAST MAY BE MAINLY RAIN-FREE DUE TO MORE STABLE AFFECTS FROM THE ONSHORE FLOW/.  AS FOR THE HIGH TEMPERATURES, WE USED A MOS BLEND WITH SOME TWEAKS THEREAFTER. THESE COULD BE TRICKY AS THE MARINE LAYER TAKES HOLD, THEREFORE THE WARMEST HIGH TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE FARTHER INLAN  
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS FOR KPHL, KPNE, KTTN, KABE, KRDG, KILG, KMIV, KACY AND SURROUNDING AREAS.  TODAY...SOME LOCAL MVFR OR LOWER CONDITIONS EARLY DUE TO FOG, OTHERWISE VFR GIVING WAY TO MVFR CEILINGS FROM EAST TO WEST /SOME IFR CEILINGS POSSIBLE/. OUR CONFIDENCE IS LOWER THE FARTHER WEST. SOME SHOWERS AND A FEW AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS, WITH THE GREATEST COVERAGE PROBABLY NEAR AND TO THE WEST AND SOUTH OF KPHL. MOSTLY LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS EARLY, THEN BECOMING EASTERLY UP TO 10 KNOTS BEFORE TURNING SOUTHEAST.  TONIGHT...MVFR/IFR CEILINGS WITH AN ONSHORE FLOW AND INCREASED LOW- LEVEL MOISTURE. SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED, WITH THE GREATEST CHANCE MOSTLY WEST OF KPHL. SOME FOG IS EXPECTED ESPECIALLY OVERNIGHT. WINDS LIGHT FROM THE EAST OR SOUTHEAST.  OUTLOOK... TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...LOW CLOUDS DISSIPATE IN THE MORNING, BUT MVFR AND IFR STILL POSSIBLE UNDER ANY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. COLD FRONT/NW WIND SHIFT PUSHES OVER THE REGION AT NIGHT.  WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...VFR. SOME GUSTY NORTHWEST WINDS ON WEDNESDAY.  THURSDAY...VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED, LOWEST CONFIDENCE SOUTHERN AIRPORTS AS THEY WILL BE CLOSEST TO TRACK OF TRANSCONTINENTAL LOW.  THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...MOSTLY VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED.  
INCREASING SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM CHANCES WERE MAINTAINED TODAY AS RIDGING ERODES WITH THE ADVANCE OF AN UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT OUT OF THE MID WEST. HIGH TEMPERATURES WERE ADJUSTED MINIMALLY USING A BLEND OF GUIDANCE.  SEVERE WEATHER IS NOT ANTICIPATED GIVEN INSTABILITY AND SHEAR LIMITATIONS.  
HIGH PRESSURE IS POSITIONED OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST. A WEAK DOOR COLD FRONT WILL SLIDE SOUTH INTO THE AREA TODAY BEFORE DISSIPATING. A STRONGER COLD FRONT WILL MOVE IN FROM THE WEST TUESDAY. COOL AND DRY HIGH PRESSURE WILL FOLLOW FROM THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK UNTIL THE EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEKEND.  
PLENTY OF LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINS IN PLACE...AND WITH LIGHT WINDS ALONG WITH BREAKS IN THE CLOUD COVER...AREAS OF FOG ARE EXPECTED LATE TONIGHT. SOME FOG MAY BE DENSE. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR VISIBILITIES OVERNIGHT.  HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE ATLANTIC TONIGHT WHILE AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE REMAINS OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS. THE UPPER- LEVEL RIDGE AXIS WILL EXTEND NORTH INTO OUR AREA.  A BACKDOOR BOUNDARY WILL MOVE INTO EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA LATER MONDAY. MORE WARM AND HUMID CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM. THE BOUNDARY AND A SURFACE TROUGH WILL ACT AS LIFTING MECHANISMS FOR MORE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. COVERAGE OF CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER THAN SUNDAY DUE TO LESS MID-LEVEL CLOUDS AND STRONGER FORCING FROM THE SURFACE TROUGH AND APPROACHING BACKDOOR BOUNDARY. SOME OF THE STORMS WILL BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING SMALL HAIL...GUSTY WINDS AND HEAVY DOWNPOURS. AFTERNOON HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY REACH THE MIDDLE TO UPPER 80S.  
PIECES OF UPPER LEVEL ENERGY WILL RIDE AROUND THE NORTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE WEAKENING RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE CAROLINAS. SHOWERS AND A COUPLE OF THUNDERSTORMS WILL AFFECT THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT AS A FRONT BECOMES STALLED ACROSS THE REGION.  A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL SLIDE ACROSS THE LOWER GREAT LAKES TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...GENERATING ONE FINAL ROUND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY BEFORE COOLER AND DRIER AIR PUSHES INTO THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT.  
DRY CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN ACROSS THE REGION. HIGHS WILL BE IN THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 70S WEDNESDAY WITH LOWS IN THE MIDDLE 40S IN THE POTOMAC HIGHLANDS TO LOWER 50S ALONG THE TIDAL POTOMAC.  ONCE THE HIGH PRESSURE MOVES TO THE COAST THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT...A SOUTHERLY RETURN FLOW WILL DEVELOP AND USHER BACK IN MORE HUMID AIR FROM THE SOUTH. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN SHOWERS THURSDAY WITH A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THURSDAY NIGHT...MAINLY IN THE SOUTH AND WEST...AS WEAK UPPER LEVEL ENERGY PIVOTS ACROSS THE EASTERN OHIO VALLEY.  HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...BRINGING DRIER CONDITIONS TO THE REGION WITH HIGHS IN THE MIDDLE TO UPPER 70S EACH DAY. ENERGY ARRIVING FROM THE WEST SUNDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK COULD BRING OUR NEXT ROUND OF SHOWERS AND INTENSE THUNDERSTORMS.  
AREAS OF BR/FOG ARE EXPECTED OVERNIGHT WITH MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS LIKELY. THE BEST CHANCE FOR IFR CONDITIONS WILL BE ACROSS THE WESTERN TERMINALS. AND FOG WILL BURN OFF MONDAY MORNING. ADDITIONAL SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  MAINLY MVFR CONDITIONS TONIGHT AND TUESDAY WITH EXCEPTION TO IFR OR LIFR CONDITIONS IN SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY EACH PERIOD. WINDS WILL BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE EXCEPT IN ANY GUSTY THUNDERSTORMS.  VFR CONDITIONS TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO THE REGION. WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE NORTHWEST AND INCREASE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING.  MAINLY VFR OR MVFR CONDITIONS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY WITH A CHANCE OF IFR CONDITIONS NEAR CHO TERMINAL WITH ANY PASSING SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY.  
WINDS WILL LIKELY REMAIN BELOW SCA CRITERIA TODAY. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL IMPACT THE WATERS WHICH MAY REQUIRE THE ISSUANCE OF SMWS...MAINLY MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  NO MARINE HAZARDS MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY. SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS POSSIBLE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY WEDNESDAY. NO MARINE HAZARDS MIDDAY WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY.  
UNUSUALLY WARM WEATHER IS FORECAST THE NEXT FEW NIGHTS. BELOW IS A LIST OF RECORD HIGH MINIMUM TEMPERATURES FOR MAY 17TH...18TH AND 19TH.  SITE...MAY 17TH.........MAY 18TH.........MAY 19TH......... DCA....69 (1974)........68 (1995*).......70 (1986/1962)... BWI....68 (1946/1911)...68 (1900/1896)...75 (1877)........ IAD....65 (1974)........66 (1995)........66 (1969)........  *ALSO IN 1953...1943 AND 1900.  
QUICK UPDATE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE AREAS OF FOG THAT ARE DVLPNG... MAINLY IN THE AREAS THAT GOT RAIN THIS EVENING.  WEAK IMPULE PROVIDING JUST ENUF LIFT FOR SCT SHWRS TO MAKE IT E OF MTS AND INTO WRN AKQ CNTYS LATE THIS EVENING. NO LIGHTNING BEING OBSERVED PAST HR OR SO. ADJUSTED GRIDS TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS TREND WITH LATEST HRRR/RAP/SREF INDCTG THESE SHWRS LINGER INTO THE OVRNIGHT HRS DUE TO THE JUICYNESS OF THE AIRMASS. HAVE 30-40 POP THRU MIDNIGHT PIEDMONT AREAS WITH A SLGHT CHC BUFFER AREA CLOSER TO THE BAY AND NC/VA BORDER. JUST ISLTD SHWR CHC AFTR MIDNIGHT. WARM AND HUMID WITH LOWS 65-70.  
OVERALL, EXPECT SFC HIGH PRESSURE TO REMAIN ANCHORED OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST. MEANWHILE, AFOREMENTIONED FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO THE NORTH WILL BE SHUNTED EAST ACROSS MID-SOUTH AND OHIO VALLEY MONDAY NIGHT, AS A CLOSED UPPER LOW SLOWLY FILLS AS IF LIFTS NORTHEAST TOWARD THE UPPER GREAT LAKES MONDAY INTO EARLY TUESDAY. THIS WILL SERVE TO DAMPEN THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AS IT SHIFTS EAST OVER THE REGION. PRESSURE FALLS ON THE LEE SIDE OF THE APPALACHIANS WILL RESULT IN A SHARPENING LEE/THERMAL TROUGH OVER THE PIEDMONT INTO CENTRAL VA, WHICH SHOULD SERVE TO PROVIDE BETTER LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE AND MODEST FORCING FOR ASCENT. THUS, EXPECTING MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ON MONDAY. BEST UVM EXPECTED IN THE AFTERNOON AS WEAK PERTURBATIONS ROUND THE RIDGE, DROPPING E-SE ACROSS THE LOWER MID-ATLANTIC. SHEAR REMAINS MARGINAL UNDERNEATH THE DAMPENING UPPER RIDGE...BUT INCREASING DEWPOINTS AND BETTER INSTABILITY SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT PULSE CONVECTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE MUCAPE IS ALSO PROGGED TO BE A BIT HIGHER, GENERALLY IN THE 1000-1500 J/KG RANGE (HIGHEST OUT WEST IN THE PIEDMONT). NO MAJOR SHIFT IN FORECAST THINKING FOR TOMORROW...WITH A FEW STRONG STORMS POSSIBLE WHICH COULD PRODUCE GUSTY WINDS AND SMALL HAIL ON MON. IN ADDITION...PW AROUND +2 STD DEV AND VERY LIGHT STEERING FLOW WILL PRODUCE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL.  TEMPERATURES TOMORROW WILL BE A BIT OF A CHALLENGE, BOTH WITH RESPECT TO MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT, BUT ALSO WITH THE BACKDOOR FRONT...WHICH IS DEPICTED SIMILARLY BY 12Z/17 MODEL DATA DROPPING SOUTH ACROSS OVER THE NE COUNTIES MON AFTN/EARLY EVENING. GFS REMAINS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE WITH WARMING...NAM AND EURO MOS ARE SIMILAR AND BOTH SLIGHTLY COOLER WITH HIGHER POP/CLOUD COVERAGE. ECM/MET BLEND IS VERY CLOSE TO OFFICIAL FORECAST, AND HAVE ERRED TOWARD THE COOL SIDE OF THE GUIDANCE ENVELOPE FOR HIGHS TOMORROW. STILL WARM AND MODERATELY HUMID...HIGHS LOW TO MID 80S NORTHEAST COASTAL ZONES...U80S TO NEAR 90 SOUTH.  TUESDAY: WEAK SURFACE COLD FRONT CROSSES THE AREA TUESDAY AFTN/NIGHT. BULK SHEAR REMAINS MARGINAL AT BEST AND DOWNSLOPE FLOW ALOFT IS LESS THAN IDEAL FOR WIDESPREAD CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, STRONG SFC HEATING PRE-FRONTAL SHOULD YIELD ANOTHER ROUND OF SCATTERED SHOWERS & T-STORMS TUESDAY AFTN/EVE. WENT SLIGHTLY COOLER WITH TEMPS ON TUE, WITH EXPECTATION OF INCREASING AFTN CONVECTION. HIGHS MID 80S NORTH...UPPER 80S TO NR 90 SOUTH.  WEDNESDAY: SFC COOL FRONT SLOWLY PUSHES FARTHER SOUTH WEDNESDAY, EVENTUALLY BECOMING STALLED ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST LATER IN THE DAY. COOL/DRY HIGH PRESSURE BEGINS TO BUILD TOWARD THE AREA FROM THE WEST ON WEDNESDAY, YIELDING A MUCH DRIER/MORE COMFORTABLE DAY ON WEDNESDAY. LOOK FOR HIGH TEMPS INTO THE MID TO UPPER 70S OVER THE EASTERN SHORE TO LOW 80S INLAND...PERHAPS A FEW MID 80S ACROSS FAR SOUTHERN ZONES.  
KAKQ RADAR REMAINS OFFLINE WITH A AZIMUTH MOTOR ISSUE. TECHNICIANS EXPECT TO REPLACE THE MOTOR MONDAY MORNING.  
WARM AND HUMID CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE UNTIL PASSAGE OF A TUESDAY MORNING COLD FRONT.  
MIDNIGHT UPDATE FEATURED FEW CHANGES TO THE NEAR TERM AS CAPPED AND NEARLY SATURATED BOUNDARY LAYER WILL SUPPORT FOG IN AREAS WHERE MID LEVEL CLOUDINESS DOES NOT INCREASE THIS MORNING.  OTHERWISE...INCREASING SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM CHANCES WERE MAINTAINED TODAY AS RIDGING ERODES WITH THE ADVANCE OF AN UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT OUT OF THE MID WEST.  SEVERE WEATHER IS NOT ANTICIPATED GIVEN INSTABILITY AND SHEAR LIMITATIONS.  
MODEL GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO SUGGEST A PROLONGED PERIOD OF DRY WEATHER...WITH TEMPERATURES CLOSE TO OR JUST BELOW SEASONAL AVERAGES INTO LATE WEEK.  
VFR CONDITIONS PREVAIL ALL TERMINALS EARLY THIS EVENING. REMAINING LIGHT RAIN MOVING SEWD THROUGH EXTREME SE VA CONTINUES TO WEAKEN...AND WILL NOT AFFECT KECG. LATEST RDAR TRENDS SUGGEST SHOWERS/TSTMS WEST AND NORTH OF THE REGION WILL NOT MAKE IT INTO ANY OF THE TERMINALS BEFORE NOCTURNAL COOLING TREND CAUSES PRECIP TO WEAKEN AND/OR DISSIPATE. THUS...HAVE KEPT ALL TERMINALS DRY THROUGH 12Z MONDAY. IN ADDITION...HAVE ADDED FOG TO KPHF...WITH SOME POTENTIAL FOR IFR CONDITIONS AFTER 06Z DUE TO PRECIP THIS AFTERNOON AND RELATIVELY CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS OVERNIGHT. HAVE ALSO BACKED OFF ON IFR AT KSBY...AS TSECTIONS AND OTHER GUIDANCE DO NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING WORSE THAN MVFR.  BACKDOOR FRONT EDGES CLOSER TO THE AREA FROM THE NE ON MONDAY...REACHING KSBY 18Z OR LATER...BUT WASHING OUT BEFORE BECOMING A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR TO OTHER TERMINALS. WITH BOTH BACKDOOR FRONT AND LINGERING CONVECTIVE BOUNDARIES AROUND ON MONDAY...EXPECT THE POTENTIAL FOR AT LEAST SCTD SHOWERS/TSTMS MONDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. HOWEVER...DUE TO TIMING AND LOCATION UNCERTAINTIES...HAVE LEFT OUT OF 00Z TAFS. ADDITIONAL SHOWERS/TSTMS POSSIBLE AGAIN TUESDAY AS A STRONGER FRONT MOVES INTO THE REGION...THEN ACROSS THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT. BEHIND THIS FRONT...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR MOST OF THE REST OF THE WEEK.  
SFC HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS OFF THE SE COAST INTO TONIGHT...RESULTING IN SW WINDS (REMAINING AOB 15 KT)...WAVES ON BAY 1-2 FT...SEAS 2-3 FT. WINDS BECOME VRB/ONSHORE MON AS COMBO WEAK LOW PRESSURE AND BACKDOOR COLD FRONT SETTLES IN OVER THE MID ATLANTIC COAST. THIS WILL ALSO RESULT IN WINDS BECOMING ESE...AND ALSO A HIGH PROBABILITY FOR SHRAS/SCT TSTMS OVR THE WATERS. ANOTHER COLD FRONT PUSHES ACROSS THE WATERS LATE TUE (WITH POSSIBLE SHRAS/TSTMS). WINDS BECOME N-NW POST-FRONTAL TUE NIGHT. ATTM...STILL LOOKS LIKE THE POTENTIAL FOR SCA CONDITIONS TUE NIGHT OVER THE CHES BAY DUE TO A SURGE OF COOLER/DRIER AIR PUSHING OVER THE WATERS BEHIND THE FRONT. FOR NOW...KEEPING NW WINDS AT 15-20 KT...AND WAVES AOB 3 FT ON THE BAY...AND SEAS AOB 4 FT. RATHER BENIGN BOATING CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED WED/THU.  
HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE ATLANTIC OCEAN TONIGHT. A BACK DOOR COLD FRONT WILL SLIDE SOUTH INTO THE AREA MONDAY BEFORE DISSIPATING. A STRONGER COLD FRONT WILL MOVE IN FROM THE WEST TUESDAY. COOL AND DRY HIGH PRESSURE WILL FOLLOW FROM THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK UNTIL THE EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEKEND.  
PLENTY OF LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINS IN PLACE...AND WITH LIGHT WINDS ALONG WITH BREAKS IN THE CLOUD COVER...AREAS OF FOG ARE EXPECTED LATE TONIGHT. SOME FOG MAY BE DENSE. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR VISIBILITIES OVERNIGHT.  HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE ATLANTIC TONIGHT WHILE AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE REMAINS OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS. THE UPPER- LEVEL RIDGE AXIS WILL EXTEND NORTH INTO OUR AREA.  A SOUTHWEST FLOW AROUND THE HIGH HAS ALLOWED FOR PLENTY OF WARM AND MOIST AIR TO MOVE INTO THE AREA. CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON WAS NOT AS WIDESPREAD AS SATURDAY DUE MORE CLOUD COVER AND EVEN LESS SHEAR. THE LACK OF THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON HAS LED TO MORE INSTABILITY THIS EVENING. LATEST MESOANALYSIS  STILL SHOWS 1000 TO 1500 MLCAPE WITH LITTLE IN THE WAY OF A CAPPING INVERSION. CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPED OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN TO OUR SOUTH AND WEST HAS SPREAD NORTHEAST INTO NORTHERN VIRGINIA. CONVECTION MAY CONTINUE TO FEED OFF ITSELF THIS EVENING DUE TO THE WEAK INVERSION. THEREFORE...WILL CONTINUE WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS FOR MOST AREAS THIS EVENING. COVERAGE IS EXPECTED TO DISSIPATE OVERNIGHT AS INSTABILITY LOWERS DUE TO THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING.  A BACK DOOR BOUNDARY WILL MOVE INTO EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA LATER MONDAY. MORE WARM AND HUMID CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM. THE BACKDOOR BOUNDARY AND A SURFACE TROUGH WILL ACT AS LIFTING MECHANISMS FOR MORE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. COVERAGE OF CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER THAN SUNDAY DO TO LESS MID- LEVEL CLOUDS AND STRONGER FORCING FROM THE SURFACE TROUGH AND APPROACHING BACKDOOR BOUNDARY. SOME OF THE STORMS WILL BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING SMALL HAIL...GUSTY WINDS AND HEAVY DOWNPOURS. AFTERNOON HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY REACH THE MIDDLE TO UPPER 80S.  
PIECES OF UPPER LEVEL ENERGY WILL RIDE AROUND THE NORTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE WEAKENING RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE CAROLINAS. SHOWERS AND A COUPLE OF THUNDERSTORMS WILL AFFECT THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT AS A FRONT BECOMES STALLED ACROSS THE REGION. LOW TEMPERATURES MONDAY NIGHT WILL BE ABOUT 10 TO 15 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.  A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL SLIDE ACROSS THE LOWER GREAT LAKES TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...GENERATING ONE FINAL ROUND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING BEFORE COOLER AND DRIER AIR PUSHES INTO THE REGION TUESDAY OVERNIGHT. HIGHS TUESDAY WILL BE 10 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. LOWS TUESDAY NIGHT WILL BE COOLER THAN PREVIOUS NIGHTS.  
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM ARE EXPECTED THROUGH THIS EVENING. COVERAGE WITH CONVECTION SHOULD DISSIPATE OVERNIGHT. AREAS OF BR/FOG ARE EXPECTED OVERNIGHT WITH MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS LIKELY. THE BEST CHANCE FOR IFR CONDITIONS WILL BE ACROSS THE WESTERN TERMINALS. AND FOG WILL BURN OFF MONDAY MORNING. ADDITIONAL SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  MAINLY MVFR CONDITIONS MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WITH EXCEPTION TO IFR OR LIFR CONDITIONS IN SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY EACH PERIOD. WINDS WILL BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE EXCEPT IN ANY GUSTY THUNDERSTORMS.  VFR CONDITIONS TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO THE REGION. WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE NORTHWEST AND INCREASE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING.  MAINLY VFR OR MVFR CONDITIONS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY WITH A CHANCE OF IFR CONDITIONS NEAR CHO TERMINAL WITH ANY PASSING SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY.  
WINDS WILL LIKELY REMAIN BELOW SCA CRITERIA THROUGH MONDAY. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL IMPACT THE WATERS WHICH MAY REQUIRE THE ISSUANCE OF SMWS...MAINLY MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  NO MARINE HAZARDS MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY. SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS POSSIBLE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY WEDNESDAY. NO MARINE HAZARDS MIDDAY WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY.  
A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTHWESTWARD THROUGH THE REGION OVERNIGHT. LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO CROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION ON MONDAY. ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO PUSH THROUGH THE REGION TUESDAY. BY WEDNESDAY, HIGH PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD OVER THE REGION, AND SHOULD BE ENTRENCHED OVER OUR REGION FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK.  
SHOWERS HAVE LARGELY CLEARED OUT OF THE REGION AND SKIES HAVE STARTED TO CLEAR. A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT WILL PUSH SOUTHWESTWARD THROUGH THE REGION OVERNIGHT. THE WINDS WILL LIGHTEN UP AND START TO BECOME MORE EASTERLY TOWARD MORNING.  ONSHORE FLOW WILL COMMENCE BRINGING IN A STABLE MARINE LAYER WITH AN INCREASE IN STRATUS/FOG/DRIZZLE EXPECTED...MORE WIDESPREAD ALONG THE COAST. OUTSIDE OF THE COASTAL PLAIN SOME PATCHY FOG IS ONCE AGAIN POSSIBLE WITH AMPLE MOISTURE IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER AND LIGHTER WINDS. TEMPERATURES WILL BE WELL ABOVE NORMAL TONIGHT.  
THE EARLY MORNING FOG/DRIZZLE BEGIN TO BURN OFF SHORTLY AFTER SUNRISE BUT WE SHOULD KEEP THE MARINE STRATUS ACROSS THE REGION WITH SOME LIFTING EXPECTED BY LATE MORNING. MID-LEVEL RIDGE AXIS MOVES A TAD FARTHER TO THE EAST TOMORROW WITH MORE WEAKNESSES ALONG ITS WESTERN FLANK AS A FEW MORE MID-LEVEL IMPULSES TRAVERSE THE REGION. ONCE AGAIN, LIKE A BROKEN RECORD, WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND EMBEDDED THUNDER IS POSSIBLE TOMORROW AFTERNOON WITH THE BETTER CHANCES ALONG THE RIDGE TOPS...DIFFERENTIAL HEATING AND LESS OF A MARINE INFLUENCE EXPECTED. STILL LOOKS LIKE PULSE WILL BE THE CONVECTIVE MODE. TEMPERATURES WILL VARY GREATLY FROM EAST TO WEST FOR HIGHS WITH THE ONSHORE FLOW STRENGTHENING DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS...WARMER WEST.  
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY IS THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD. ON MONDAY NIGHT, LIGHT LOW LEVEL EASTERLY FLOW CONTINUES. WITH A STABLE BOUNDARY LAYER AND LOW CLOUDS IN PLACE, IT IS VERY UNLIKELY WE WILL SEE ANY THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUING INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. HOWEVER, WITH MEAGER ELEVATED INSTABILITY, A FEW SHOWERS AND CERTAINLY LIGHT STRATIFORM RAIN ARE POSSIBLE.  TUESDAY THE BIG QUESTION WILL BE THE TIMING OF THE FRONT. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE NAM, MOST OTHER MODELS SPED UP THE ARRIVAL OF THE FRONT, NOW MOVING THROUGH OUR REGION BETWEEN 18 AND 00Z. THE NAM IS ABOUT 6 HOURS SLOWER. THIS HAS SOME SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS ON PRECIPITATION CHANCES AND MODE. IF THE FASTER GFS/ECMWF/CMC SOLUTION IS VALID, THIS MEANS FOR MUCH OF THE AREA THERE WILL BE ONLY A BRIEF OPPORTUNITY FOR THUNDERSTORMS IN BETWEEN THE LOW CLOUDS DISSIPATING AND THE COLD FRONT ARRIVING. HOWEVER, IF THE NAM HOLDS TRUE, WE WILL NOT ONLY HAVE A LONGER WINDOW OF POTENTIAL CONVECTION, BUT THE ADDITIONAL HEATING AND LONGER PERIOD OF MOISTURE ADVECTION COULD EQUATE TO A HIGHER SEVERE WIND AND HEAVY RAIN THREAT. WITH THE NAM SOLUTION, BULK SHEAR (MOSTLY SPEED SHEAR) VALUES OF 20 TO 30 KT, PLUS CAPE VALUES UP TO 500 J/KG COULD RESULT IN SOME STRONG STORMS. WHILE SHEAR VALUES ARE SIMILAR WITH THE GFS AND ECMWF, THE EARLIER ARRIVAL OF THE FRONT MEANS MOST OF THE CONVECTIVE THREAT WILL BE CONFINED TO THE EASTERN COASTAL PLAINS, IF THERE IS ANY AT ALL, WHICH WILL STAY IN THE WARM SECTOR THE LONGEST. WITH A RELATIVELY HIGH MELTING LAYER, HAIL DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A BIG THREAT WITH EITHER SOLUTION. FOR NOW, HAVE GONE WITH THE FASTER SOLUTION GIVEN THE GOOD MODEL AGREEMENT, BUT WILL MENTION HEAVY RAIN/GUSTY WIND POTENTIAL FOR THE COASTAL PLAINS IN THE HWO.  WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...LOOKS LIKE AN EVEN QUIETER PATTERN THAN IT DID YESTERDAY. SURFACE HIGH SLOWLY BUILDS TOWARDS THE REGION AS THE UPPER LEVEL LOW LIFTS AWAY. AS WITH THE MODEL RUNS YESTERDAY, THE ONE CAVEAT TO THE DRY PATTERN IS IF A SHORT WAVE TROUGH DIGS SOUTH ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE LOW. HOWEVER, MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED, AND TIMING OF ANY SHORT WAVE TROUGHS IS VERY UNCERTAIN.  
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS FOR KPHL, KPNE, KTTN, KABE, KRDG, KILG, KMIV, KACY AND SURROUNDING AREAS.  TONIGHT...VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE WITH A TREND TOWARDS MVFR EARLY MONDAY MORNING. A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT WILL PUSH SOUTHWESTWARD THROUGH THE TERMINALS OVERNIGHT WITH WINDS VEERING TO THE EAST BY MONDAY MORNING. MARINE MVFR STRATUS WITH PATCHY MVFR/IFR FOG AND DRIZZLE IS EXPECTED AT MOST TERMINALS. MEDIUM CONFIDENCE FORECAST.  MONDAY...MAINLY MVFR CONDITIONS TO START THE DAY WITH SOME VFR POSSIBLE BY AFTERNOON. SCATTERED SHOWERS WITH SOME AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS WILL AGAIN BE POSSIBLE AT THE TERMINALS. ONSHORE FLOW WILL CONTINUE WITH CONDITIONS REMAINING POOR AT KACY THROUGH THE DAY. MEDIUM CONFIDENCE FORECAST.  OUTLOOK... MONDAY NIGHT...WIDESPREAD MVFR AND LOCALIZED IFR WITH LOW CLOUDS AND LIGHT EASTERLY FLOW.  TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...LOW CLOUDS DISSIPATE IN THE MORNING, BUT MVFR AND IFR STILL POSSIBLE UNDER ANY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. COLD FRONT/NW WIND SHIFT PUSHES OVER THE REGION THROUGH THE DAY.  WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...MOSTLY VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED.  
TONIGHT - MONDAY...SUB-SCA CONDITIONS ACROSS THE WATERS EXPECTED. WESTERLY FLOW VEER TOWARDS THE NORTH-NORTHEAST LATE TONIGHT BEHIND A SOUTHWARD SAGGING COLD FRONT. SEAS WILL REMAIN AROUND 3 TO 4 FEET WITH SOME GUSTS UPWARDS OF 20 KNOTS THROUGH MONDAY MORNING.  OUTLOOK... TUESDAY...SUB SCA CONDITIONS ARE MOSTLY EXPECTED. HOWEVER...GUSTY WINDS WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE VICINITY OF ANY THUNDERSTORMS.  WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...WINDS AND SEAS SHOULD REMAIN BELOW SCA CRITERIA. A FEW GUSTS NEAR OR ABOVE 20 KT ARE POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  
WEAK IMPULE PROVIDING JUST ENUF LIFT FOR SCT SHWRS TO MAKE IT E OF MTS AND INTO WRN AKQ CNTYS LATE THIS EVENING. NO LIGHTNING BEING OBSERVED PAST HR OR SO. ADJUSTED GRIDS TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS TREND WITH LATEST HRRR/RAP/SREF INDCTG THESE SHWRS LINGER INTO THE OVRNIGHT HRS DUE TO THE JUICYNESS OF THE AIRMASS. HAVE 30-40 POP THRU MIDNIGHT PIEDMONT AREAS WITH A SLGHT CHC BUFFER AREA CLOSER TO THE BAY AND NC/VA BORDER. JUST ISLTD SHWR CHC AFTR MIDNIGHT. WARM AND HUMID WITH LOWS 65-70.  
HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE ATLANTIC TONIGHT WHILE AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE REMAINS OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS. THE UPPER- LEVEL RIDGE AXIS WILL EXTEND NORTH INTO OUR AREA.  A SOUTHWEST FLOW AROUND THE HIGH HAS ALLOWED FOR PLENTY OF WARM AND MOIST AIR TO MOVE INTO THE AREA. CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON WAS NOT AS WIDESPREAD AS SATURDAY DUE MORE CLOUD COVER AND EVEN LESS SHEAR. THE LACK OF THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON HAS LED TO MORE INSTABILITY THIS EVENING. LATEST MESOANALYSIS  STILL SHOWS 1000 TO 1500 MLCAPE WITH LITTLE IN THE WAY OF A CAPPING INVERSION. CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPED OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN TO OUR SOUTH AND WEST HAS SPREAD NORTHEAST INTO NORTHERN VIRGINIA. CONVECTION MAY CONTINUE TO FEED OFF ITSELF THIS EVENING DUE TO THE WEAK INVERSION. THEREFORE...WILL CONTINUE WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS FOR MOST AREAS THIS EVENING. COVERAGE IS EXPECTED TO DISSIPATE OVERNIGHT AS INSTABILITY LOWERS DUE TO THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING.  A BACK DOOR BOUNDARY WILL MOVE INTO EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA LATER MONDAY. MORE WARM AND HUMID CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM. THE BACKDOOR BOUNDARY AND A SURFACE TROUGH WILL ACT AS LIFTING MECHANISMS FOR MORE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. COVERAGE OF CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER THAN SUNDAY DO TO LESS MID- LEVEL CLOUDS AND STRONGER FORCING FROM THE SURFACE TROUGH AND APPROACHING BACKDOOR BOUNDARY. SOME OF THE STORMS WILL BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING SMALL HAIL...GUSTY WINDS AND HEAVY DOWNPOURS. AFTERNOON HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY REACH THE MIDDLE TO UPPER 80S.  
UNUSUALLY WARM WEATHER IS FORECAST THE NEXT FEW NIGHTS. BELOW IS A LIST OF RECORD HIGH MINIMUM TEMPERATURES FOR MAY 17TH...18TH AND 19TH.  SITE...MAY 17TH.........MAY 18TH.........MAY 19TH......... DCA....69 (1974)........68 (1995*).......70 (1986/1962)... BWI....68 (1946/1911)...68 (1900/1896)...75 (1877)........ IAD....65 (1974)........66 (1995)........66 (1969)........  *ALSO IN 1953...1943 AND 1900.   
WARM AND HUMID CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE UNTIL PASSAGE OF A TUESDAY COLD FRONT.  
EARLY EVENING UPDATE CENTERED REALLY AROUND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND ITS RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. PREVIOUS FORECAST COVERED DIURNALLY-DRIVEN SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS WITH LITTLE UPPER SUPPORT FAIRLY WELL...AND STILL SEEMS A-OK. HOWEVER...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE VIA DEWPOINTS ACROSS OHIO IS ACTUALLY A BIT STRONGER THAN DEPICTED ON ANY MODEL SOLUTION THIS EVENING...INCLUDING THE HRRR. DEWPOINTS ACROSS THE BULK OF OHIO ARE RUNNING IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S...AND EVEN IN PENNSYLVANIA AND WEST VIRGINIA...MID TO UPPER 60S ARE FAIRLY PREVALENT. GIVEN POOR MIXING AND WEAK CONVECTIVE OVERTURNING...ALONG WITH WET SOIL FROM RAIN THIS MORNING IN MOST LOCATIONS...IT WOULD SEEM WE ARE WELL PRIMED FOR FOG DEVELOPMENT OVERNIGHT. GIVEN BUFKIT SOUNDINGS FROM THE NAM OVER MOST OF THE AREA EXCEPT MAYBE OUR WESTERNMOST COUNTIES IN OHIO...DECOUPLING AND STABILIZATION OF THE BOUNDARY LAYER SHOULD LEAD TO SOME FOG OVERNIGHT. FARTHER WEST TOWARD ZANESVILLE...THE ONLY THING THAT MAY INHIBIT THIS WOULD BE SOME PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH MIXING OVERNIGHT TOWARD MORNING. TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF THIS...AREAS OF FOG WERE CARRIED MOST EVERYWHERE OVERNIGHT...EXCEPT AROUND ZANESVILLE...WHERE JUST PATCHY FOG WAS CARRIED.  OTHERWISE...THE PREVIOUS FORECAST HANDLES THE SLOW DEMISE OF THUNDERSTORMS INTO ISOLATED SHOWERS OVERNIGHT WITH FAIRLY STABLE TEMPERATURES IN THE MID AND UPPER 60S. FRIES  
DESPITE THE MODELS BEING LOADED WITH ENOUGH MOISTURE FOR PCPN TO OCCUR...NOT MUCH ACTIVITY HAS DEVELOPED ACROSS THE FA PAST FEW HOURS. AREA OF SHWRS/TSTRMS OVER SERN VA HAS WEAKENED AS WELL. WITH THE DAYTIME HEATING WANING...WENT AHEAD AND LOWERED THE POPS ACROSS VA/MD THIS EVE TO 20-30%...KEEPING NC COUNTIES DRY FOR NOW. A SHWR STILL PSBL AFTR MIDNITE GIVEN HOW MOIST THE AIRMASS IS. LOWS 65-70.  
VFR CONDITIONS PREVAIL ALL TERMINALS EARLY THIS EVENING. REMAINING LIGHT RAIN MOVING SEWD THROUGH EXTREME SE VA CONTINUES TO WEAKEN...AND WILL NOT AFFECT KECG. LATEST RDAR TRENDS SUGGEST SHOWERS/TSTMS WEST AND NORTH OF THE REGION WILL NOT MAKE IT INTO ANY OF THE TERMINALS BEFORE NOCTURNAL COOLING TREND CAUSES PRECIP TO WEAKEN AND/OR DISSIPATE. THUS...HAVE KEPT ALL TERMINALS DRY THROUGH 12Z MONDAY. IN ADDITION...HAVE ADDED FOG TO KPHF...WITH SOME POTENTIAL FOR IFR CONDITIONS AFTER 06Z DUE TO PRECIP THIS AFTERNOON AND RELATIVELY CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS OVERNIGHT. HAVE ALSO BACKED OFF ON IFR AT KSBY...AS TSECTIONS AND OTHER GUIDANCE DO NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING WORSE THAN MVFR.  BACKDOOR FRONT EDGES CLOSER TO THE AREA FROM THE NE ON MONDAY...REACHING KSBY 18Z OR LATER...BUT WASHING OUT BEFORE BECOMING A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR TO OTHER TERMINALS. WITH BOTH BACKDOOR FRONT AND LINGERING CONVECTIVE BOUNDARIES AROUND ON MONDAY...EXPECT THE POTENTIAL FOR AT LEAST SCTD SHOWERS/TSTMS MONDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. HOWEVER...DUE TO TIMING AND LOCATION UNCERTAINTIES...HAVE LEFT OUT OF 00Z TAFS. ADDITIONAL SHOWERS/TSTMS POSSIBLE AGAIN TUESDAY AS A STRONGER FRONT MOVES INTO THE REGION...THEN ACROSS THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT. BEHIND THIS FRONT...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR MOST OF THE REST OF THE WEEK.   
MNLY VFR CONDS (BKN MID/HI CLDNS WITH SCT CU AROUND 4 KFT AND ABOVE) THROUGH THIS AFTN. ADDITIONAL SCT SHRAS/TSTMS PSBL LATE THIS AFTN/EVE...HIGHEST PROB INVOF KSBY/KRIC. PRIMARY WIND DIRECTION SW...AVGG SPEEDS 5-15 KT. XPCG PCPN TO BE SLO TO DISSIPATE TNGT. WK BACKDOOR CDFNT SETTLES S INTO THE RGN MON. WNDS BECOME LGT AND ONSHORE...WHICH INCREASES PTNTL FOR LIFR/IFR CONDS MON NGT/EARLY TUE. OTRW...NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS WILL BRING HI CHCS FOR FOR MNLY AFTN/EVE SHRAS/TSTMS FOR ALL TAF SITES.  
HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS ANCHORED OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST THROUGH TUESDAY. A COLD FRONT CROSSES THE REGION BY TUESDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY.  
LATEST SFC WX ANALYSIS FEATURES ~1027MB HIGH PRES IN PLACE OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST, WITH A FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION. ALOFT, SUBJECTIVE UPPER AIR ANALYSIS REVEALS UPPER LEVEL RIDGE STILL IN PLACE FROM THE EASTERN GULF COAST ALL THE WAY UP THE EAST COAST. MEANWHILE TO THE WEST, CLOSED UPPER LEVEL LOW CONTINUES TO SLOWLY LIFT ACRS THE PLAINS STATES.  REGIONAL RADAR MOSAIC INDICATING SOME ISOLATED TO WIDELY SCATTERED CONVECTION BEGINNING TO DEVELOP ACROSS CENTRAL AND EASTERN VA, THOUGH MOST OF THE CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT REMAINS TO OUR NNW...WHERE MSAS DATA IS SHOWING A SUBTLE LEE TROUGH BEGINNING TO DEVELOP. ACCORDINGLY CONTINUED TO ORIENT LIKELY TO HIGH END CHC POP NEAREST TO THIS AREA OF BEST MOISTURE/FORCING ACROSS NORTHERN ZONES. GIVEN STORM MODE EXPECTED TO BE SUB-SVR PULSE STORMS. WITH WEAK STEERING FLOW AND MOIST AIRMASS, LOCALLY HVY RAINFALL IS THE CHIEF CONCERN WITH ANY STORMS TODAY/TNGT.  HRRR AND NAM MODEL REFLECTIVITY REMAIN CONSISTENT WITH DEPICTION OF SOME ADDITIONAL SHRA/TSTM DEVELOPMENT LATE THIS AFTN DROPPING E-SE TOWARD THE NC/VA BORDER EARLY THIS EVENING. THEREFORE ADDED IN AN ISO/SLIGHT CHC AREA OVER SOUTHERN SECTIONS AFTER SUNSET. OTHERWISE, ONCE AGAIN EXPECT SHRA COVERAGE TO WANE WITH LOSS OF HEATING AFTER 02-03Z OR SO...BUT WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHC GOING ALL NIGHT OVER ALL ZONES WITH PW ALREADY UPWARDS OF +2 STD DEV. SKY REMAINS PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY OVERNIGHT WITH VERY MILD EARLY MORNING LOWS SETTLING ONLY INTO THE MID TO UPR 60S NORTH TO NEAR 70 FAR SOUTH.  
A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL SLIDE SOUTH OVER THE REGION TONIGHT. BY TOMORROW, LOW WILL BEGIN TO CROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION. ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO PUSH THROUGH THE REGION TUESDAY. BY WEDNESDAY, HIGH PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD OVER THE REGION, AND SHOULD BE ENTRENCHED OVER OUR REGION FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK.  
A WEAK AREA OF SURFACE CONVERGENCE HAS SETUP ACROSS THE PHILLY METRO CORRIDOR EXTENDING SOUTHEASTWARD TOWARDS ATLANTIC CITY. MORE THAN LIKELY THIS CONVERGENCE WAS GENERATED BY THE LATE MORNING CLEARING THAT OCCURRED ACROSS THIS AREA ALLOWING FOR A WEAK MESO-SCALE BOUNDARY TO FORM...DIFFERENTIAL HEATING FROM CLOUDY TO CLOUDLESS AREAS. THIS CONVERGENCE COMBINED WITH THE PASSAGE OF A WEAK MID- LEVEL SHORTWAVE HELPED TO INITIATE SOME LOW-TOPPED SHOWERS. EVEN THOUGH THERE IS ENOUGH INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE TO TAP INTO THE LACK OF SHEAR KEPT THEM TOO UPRIGHT TO ALLOW FOR THE UPDRAFTS TO BE CHOKED OFF BY THE FALLING RAIN. THIS TREND WILL MORE THAN LIKELY CONTINUE ANYWHERE SHOWERS INITIATE THIS EVENING. THAT BEING SAID, THERE IS A SOMEWHAT BETTER CHANCE FOR SHOWERY ACTIVITY ACROSS THE DELMARVA ZONES INTO SOUTHERN NEW JERSEY WHERE HIGHER MLCAPE VALUES LIE AS THE CLOUDS HAVE SCATTERED OUT BUT WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME WITH SURFACE INSOLATION.  AFTER THE SHOWERS DECAY, LATER THIS EVENING IF NOT RIGHT AFTER SUNSET, SKIES WILL CLEAR UP MORE AHEAD OF A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT AS IT PRESSES SOUTHEASTWARD LATE TONIGHT. ONSHORE FLOW WILL COMMENCE BRINGING IN A STABLE MARINE LAYER WITH AN INCREASE IN STRATUS/FOG/DRIZZLE EXPECTED...MORE WIDESPREAD ALONG THE COAST. OUTSIDE OF THE COASTAL PLAIN SOME PATCHY FOG IS ONCE AGAIN POSSIBLE WITH AMPLE MOISTURE IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER AND LIGHTER WINDS. TEMPERATURES WILL BE WELL ABOVE NORMAL TONIGHT.  
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS FOR KPHL, KPNE, KTTN, KABE, KRDG, KILG, KMIV, KACY AND SURROUNDING AREAS.  THIS EVENING - TONIGHT...VFR TRENDING TOWARDS MVFR BY LATER MONDAY MORNING. SOME VERY WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDER STILL POSSIBLE BUT IT LOOKS MORE FLEETING THIS EVENING. BACK DOOR COLD FRONT WILL VEER WINDS TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST BY MID-MONDAY MORNING. MARINE MVFR STRATUS WITH PATCHY MVFR/IFR FOG AND DRIZZLE IS EXPECTED AT MOST TERMINALS. MEDIUM CONFIDENCE FORECAST.  MONDAY...MOSTLY MVFR WITH SOME VFR BREAKS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE WESTERN TERMINALS BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. ONSHORE FLOW WILL KEEP THE EASTERN TERMINALS PRETTY SOCKED IN. ANOTHER ROUND OF WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDER POSSIBLE DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS...BETTER CHANCES WEST. TOO EARLY TO KNOW OF ANY TERMINAL IMPACTS SO THE TAFS ARE DRY FOR THE TIME BEING. MEDIUM CONFIDENCE FORECAST.  OUTLOOK... MONDAY NIGHT...WIDESPREAD MVFR AND LOCALIZED IFR WITH LOW CLOUDS AND LIGHT EASTERLY FLOW.  TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...LOW CLOUDS DISSIPATE IN THE MORNING, BUT MVFR AND IFR STILL POSSIBLE UNDER ANY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. COLD FRONT/NW WIND SHIFT PUSHES OVER THE REGION THROUGH THE DAY.  WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...MOSTLY VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED.  
KAKQ RADAR REMAINS OFFLINE WITH A COMMS/ELEVATION ISSUE. TECHNICIANS ARE WORKING ON RADAR NOW...AND FURTHER UPDATES WILL BE PASSED ALONG AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE.  
LATEST SFC WX ANALYSIS FEATURES ~1027MB HIGH PRES IN PLACE OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST, WITH A FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION. ALOFT, SUBJECTIVE UPPER AIR ANALYSIS REVEALS UPPER LEVEL RIDGE STILL IN PLACE FROM THE EASTERN GULF COAST ALL THE WAY UP THE EAST COAST. MEANWHILE TO THE WEST, CLOSED UPPER LEVEL LOW CONTINUES TO SLOWLY LIFT ACRS THE PLAINS STATES.  REGIONAL RADAR MOSAIC INDICATING SOME ISOLATED TO WIDELY SCATTERED CONVECTION BEGINNING TO DEVELOP ACROSS CENTRAL AND EASTERN VA, THOUGH MOST OF THE CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT REMAINS TO OUR NNW...WHERE MSAS DATA IS SHOWING A SUBTLE LEE TROUGH BEGINNING TO DEVELOP. ACCORDINGLY CONTINUED TO ORIENT LIKELY TO HIGH END CHC POP NEAREST TO THIS AREA OF BEST MOISTURE/FORCING ACROSS NORTHERN ZONES. GIVEN STORM MODE EXPECTED TO BE SUB-SVR PULSE STORMS. WITH WEAK STEERING FLOW AND MOIST AIRMASS, LOCALLY HVY RAINFALL IS THE CHIEF CONCERN WITH ANY STORMS TODAY/TNGT.  HRRR AND NAM MODEL REFLECTIVITY REMAIN CONSISTENT WITH DEPICTION OF SOME ADDITIONAL SHRA/TSTM DEVELOPMENT LATE THIS AFTN DROPPING E-SE TOWARD THE NC/VA BORDER EARLY THIS EVENING. THEREFORE ADDED IN AN ISO/SLIGHT CHC AREA OVER SOUTHERN SECTIONS AFTER SUNSET. OTHERWISE, ONCE AGAIN EXPECT SHRA COVERAGE TO WANE WITH LOSS OF HEATING AFTER 2-3Z OR SO...BUT WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHC GOING ALL NIGHT ALL ZONES WITH PW ALREADY UPWARDS OF +2 STD DEV. SKY REMAINS PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY OVERNIGHT WITH EARLY MORNING LOWS SETTLING ONLY INTO THE MID TO UPR 60S NORTH TO NEAR 70 FAR SOUTH.  
OVERALL, EXPECT SFC HIGH PRESSURE TO REMAIN ANCHORED OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST. MEANWHILE, AFOREMENTIONED FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO THE NORTH WILL BE SHUNTED EAST ACROSS MID-SOUTH AND OHIO VALLEY MONDAY NIGHT, AS A CLOSED UPPER LOW SLOWLY FILLS AS IF LIFTS NORTHEAST TOWARD THE UPPER GREAT LAKES MONDAY INTO EARLY TUESDAY. THIS WILL SERVE TO DAMPEN THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AS IT SHIFTS EAST OVER THE REGION. PRESSURE FALLS ON THE LEE SIDE OF THE APPALACHIANS WILL RESULT IN A SHARPENING LEE/THERMAL TROUGH OVER THE PIEDMONT INTO CENTRAL VA, WHICH SHOULD SERVE TO PROVIDE BETTER LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE AND MODEST FORCING FOR ASCENT. THUS, EXPECTING MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ON MONDAY. BEST UVM EXPECTED IN THE AFTERNOON AS WEAK PERTURBATIONS ROUND THE RIDGE, DROPPING E-SE ACROSS THE LOWER MID-ATLANTIC. SHEAR REMAINS MARGINAL UNDERNEATH THE DAMPENING UPPER RIDGE...BUT INCREASING DEWPOINTS AND BETTER INSTABILITY SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT PULSE CONVECTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE MUCAPE IS ALSO PROGGED TO BE A BIT HIGHER, GENERALLY IN THE 1000-1500 J/KG RANGE (HIGHEST OUT WEST IN THE PIEDMONT). NO MAJOR SHIFT IN FORECAST THINKING FOR TOMORROW...WITH A FEW STRONG STORMS POSSIBLE WHICH COULD PRODUCE GUSTY WINDS AND SMALL HAIL ON MON. IN ADDITION...PW AROUND +2 STD DEV AND VERY LIGHT STEERING FLOW WILL PRODUCE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL.  TEMPERATURES TOMORROW WILL BE A BIT OF A CHALLENGE, BOTH WITH RESPECT TO MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT, BUT ALSO WITH THE BACKDOOR FRONT...WHICH IS DEPICTED SIMILARLY BY 12Z/17 MODEL DATA DROPPING SOUTH ACROSS OVER THE NE COUNTIES MON AFTN/EARLY EVENING. GFS REMAINS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE WITH WARMING...NAM AND EURO MOS ARE SIMILAR AND BOTH SLIGHTLY COOLER WITH HIGHER POP/CLOUD COVERAGE. ECM/MET BLEND IS VERY CLOSE TO OFFICIAL FORECAST, AND HAVE ERRED TOWARD THE COOL SIDE OF THE GUIDANCE ENVELOPE FOR HIGHS TOMORROW. STILL WARM AND MODERATELY HUMID...HIGHS LOW TO MID 80S NORTHEAST COASTAL ZONES...U80S TO NEAR 90 SOUTH.  TUESDAY: WEAK SURFACE COLD FRONT CROSSES THE AREA TUESDAY AFTN/NIGHT. BULK SHEAR REMAINS MARGINAL AT BEST AND DOWNSLOPE FLOW ALOFT IS LESS THAN IDEAL FOR WIDESPREAD CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, STRONG SFC HEATING PRE-FRONTAL SHOULD YIELD ANOTHER ROUND OF SCATTERED SHOWERS & T-STORMS TUESDAY AFTN/EVE. WENT SLIGHTLY COOLER WITH TEMPS ON TUE, WITH EXPECTATION OF INCREASING AFTN CONVECTION. HIGHS MID 80S NORTH...UPPER 80S TO NR 90 SOUTH.  WEDNESDAY: SFC COOL FRONT SLOWLY PUSHES FARTHER SOUTH WEDNESDAY, EVENTUALLY BECOMING STALLED ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST LATER IN THE DAY. COOL/DRY HIGH PRESSURE BEGINS TO BUILD TOWARD THE AREA FROM THE WEST ON WEDNESDAY, YIELDING A MUCH DRIER/MORE COMFORTABLE DAY ON WEDNESDAY. LOOK FOR HIGH TEMPS INTO THE MID TO UPPER 70S OVER THE EASTERN SHORE TO LOW 80S INLAND...PERHAPS A FEW MID 80S ACROSS FAR SOUTHERN ZONES.  
KAKQ RADAR REMAINS OFFLINE WITH A COMMS/ELEVATION ISSUE. TECHNICIANS ARE WORKING ON RADAR NOW...AND FURTHER UPDATES WILL BE PASSED ALONG AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE.  
BERMUDA HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE ATLANTIC WILL CONTINUE TO PUMP HUMIDITY OVER THE REGION THE REMAINDER OF THIS WEEKEND. A BACK DOOR COLD FRONT WILL SLIDE SOUTH INTO THE AREA MONDAY BEFORE DISSIPATING. A STRONGER COLD FRONT WILL MOVE IN FROM THE WEST TUESDAY. COOL AND DRY HIGH PRESSURE WILL FOLLOW FROM THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK UNTIL THE EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEKEND.  
CLOUD COVER CONTINUES TO SLOWLY ERODE LEADING TO A GRADUAL DESTABILIZATION OF THE BOUNDARY LAYER. SPC MESO-ANALYSIS INDICATES BETWEEN 500-1000 J/KG OF MIXED LAYER CAPE WITH ALL CIN ERODING OUT. CONVECTIVE TEMPS ARE BEING MET AND SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ARE DEVELOPING. EXPECT COVERAGE TO INCREASE BETWEEN 20-03Z WITH A FEW STORMS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING HEAVY DOWNPOURS...BRIEF GUSTY WINDS AND SMALL HAIL. THE ACTIVITY WILL DIMINISH AFTER SUNSET. PATCHY FOG WILL LIKELY DEVELOP OVERNIGHT AS MOIST CONDITIONS PERSIST.  WARM AND HUMID CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY ON MONDAY WITH ADDITIONAL CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. SOME OF THE STORMS WILL BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING SMALL HAIL...GUSTY WINDS AND HEAVY DOWNPOURS. AFTERNOON HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY REACH THE MIDDLE TO UPPER 80S.  
SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CAN BE EXPECTED AT ALL TERMINAL SITES FROM 20-03Z. SOME OF THE STORMS WILL BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING HEAVY DOWNPOURS...SMALL HAIL AND GUSTY WINDS. THE ACTIVITY WILL DIMINISH BY 03Z. PATCHY FOG WILL LIKELY DEVELOP OVERNIGHT AND THEN MIX OUT MONDAY AM. ADDITIONAL SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  MAINLY MVFR CONDITIONS MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WITH EXCEPTION TO IFR OR LIFR CONDITIONS IN SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY EACH PERIOD. BEST CHANCE FOR LIFR CONDITIONS TUESDAY AFTERNOON. WINDS WILL BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE EXCEPT IN ANY GUSTY THUNDERSTORMS.  VFR CONDITIONS TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO THE REGION. WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE NORTHWEST AND INCREASE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING.  MAINLY VFR OR MVFR CONDITIONS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY WITH A CHANCE OF IFR CONDITIONS NEAR CHO TERMINAL WITH ANY PASSING SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY.  
WINDS WILL LIKELY REMAIN BELOW SCA CRITERIA THROUGH MONDAY. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL IMPACT THE WATERS WHICH MAY REQUIRE THE ISSUANCE OF SMWS BOTH THIS AFTERNOON AND TOMORROW.  NO MARINE HAZARDS MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY. SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS POSSIBLE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY WEDNESDAY. NO MARINE HAZARDS MIDDAY WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY.  
WITH EXIT OF UPPER LEVEL WAVE SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION HAS DEVELOPED ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION AND WILL CONTINUE UNTIL AFTER SUNSET. LEFT ISOLATED SHOWERS IN OVERNIGHT WITH HIGH DEW POINTS AND DEEP MOISTURE...A STRAY SHOWER WILL BE POSSIBLE.  FOR MONDAY A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH WILL MOVE INTO AND ACROSS THE REGION WITH THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE AFTERNOON. SPC HAS A MARGINAL THREAT OF SEVERE...WITH PLENY OF LOW LEVEL INSTABILITY BUT UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT LACKING. TEMPERATURES THROUGH MONDAY JUST A BIT ABOVE MODEL MOS WITH HIGH DEW POINTS TONIGHT...AND POSSIBLY A BIT MORE SUNSHINE MONDAY.  
LATE MORNING SFC ANALYSIS FEATURES ~1027MB HIGH PRES IN PLACE OFF THE CAROLINA COAST, WITH A FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION. THE FRONT TO THE NORTH WILL MAKE LITTLE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE MID ATLANTIC THROUGH THE DAY TDA, AS SFC HIGH PRES REMAINS ANCHORED OFFSHORE.  MADE SOME MINOR UPDATES TO INCREASE POP THROUGH LATE AFTN ACROSS NORTHERN NECK AND EASTERN SHORE IN ASSOCIATION WITH ADDITIONAL SHORTWAVE ENERGY DROPPING E-SE FROM THE NORTHERN MID-ATLANTIC ON THE NORTHERN PERIPHERY OF UPPER RIDGE. EXPECT SIMILAR WX CONDS AS YESTERDAY JUST WITH BETTER CHANCES FOR PCPN. DOWNSCALE NAM AND HRRR HANDLING CURRENT LIGHT SHRA ACTIVITY WELL, SO HAVE LEANED CLOUD AND POP TRENDS IN ITS DIRECTION FOR THE BALANCE OF THE DAY. THE BEST CHANCE (~60% POPS) OF SHRAS/TSTMS REMAINS OVER NORTHERN TIER OF THE LOCAL AREA WHERE THE BETTER MOISTURE AND FORCING WILL BE, BUT EXPECT ISO TO WIDELY SCT SCT SHRAS AND STORMS TO FOCUS ACROSS CENTRAL VA COUNTIES LATER THIS AFTN (MAINLY NORTH OF 460). SKY GRIDS AVGG OUT PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY FOR MOST, BUT SOME FILTERED/OPAQUE SUNSHINE BEHIND THE CIRRUS CAN BE EXPECTED THROUGH THE MORNING INTO THE AFTN. TEMPS WILL BE ABOUT 10 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL...WITH HIGHS MAINLY IN THE MID 80S, BUT SOME UPR 80S STILL LIKELY TO BE FOUND ACROSS SOUTH CENTRAL VA/INTERIOR NE NC. COOLER UPR 70S TO LWR 80S TO BE FOUND NR THE CST.  
SFC HIGH SINKS SOUTH TOWARDS BERMUDA EARLY IN THE PERIOD...WITH A SFC COLD FRONT CROSSING THE REGION BY TUESDAY. EXPECT SIMILAR CONDITIONS TONIGHT/MON, ALBEIT WITH SLIGHTLY BETTER AREAL COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EACH AFTERNOON W/ADDITIONAL SPOKES OF SHORTWAVE ENERGY EXPECTED TO PUSH ACROSS THE AREA THIS EVE. MEANWHILE, A CLOSED UPPER LEVEL TROUGH FILLS AS IT EJECTS NE FROM THE CENTRAL ROCKIES INTO THE NORTHERN PLAINS LATE TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL IN TURN DAMPEN THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE IN PLACE OVER THE REGION. ASSOCIATED SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL REACH THE OH VALLEY LATE MONDAY NIGHT. PRESSURE FALLS ON THE LEE SIDE OF THE APPALACHIANS WILL RESULT IN A SHARPENING LEE/THERMAL TROUGH OVER THE PIEDMONT INTO CENTRAL VA. THE TROUGH WILL PROVIDE BETTER LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE AND MODEST FORCING FOR ASCENT. BETTER UVM EXPECTED AS WEAK PERTURBATIONS ROUND THE RIDGE. LATEST GUIDANCE EVEN SLOWER WITH THE BACKDOOR FRONT...WHICH NOW LOOKS TO DROP SOUTH ACROSS OVER THE NE COUNTIES MON AFTN/NIGHT. SHEAR REMAINS MARGINAL UNDERNEATH THE DAMPENING UPPER RIDGE...BUT WARMER DEWPOINTS AND BETTER INSTABILITY SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT PULSE CONVECTION.  MILD TONIGHT (APPROACHING RECORD HI MINS) WITH LOWS IN THE MID- UPPER 60S AND HIGH END CHC/LOW END LIKELY (50-60%) POPS AS THE FRONT DROPS INTO THE REGION. FAVORABLE FORCING/MOISTURE/INSTABILITY EXPECTED AGAIN MON...RESULTING IN A 50-60% CHANCE FOR AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. WARM AGAIN ON MON WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S/~90 INLAND AND LOW 80S NEAR THE COAST. WITH MARGINAL SHEAR UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE UPPER RIDGE...WIDESPREAD SEVERE WEATHER IS NOT EXPECTED. HOWEVER...A FEW STRONG STORMS MAY PRODUCE GUSTY WINDS AND SMALL HAIL SUN AND MON. IN ADDITION...PW AROUND +2 STD DEV AND VERY LIGHT STEERING FLOW WILL PRODUCE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL.  WEAK SURFACE COLD FRONT CROSSES THE AREA LATER TUESDAY/TUENIGHT. SHEAR IS MARGINAL AT BEST AND DOWNSLOPE FLOW ALOFT IS LESS THAN IDEAL FOR WIDESPREAD CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, STRONG SFC HEATING PRE-FRONTAL SHOULD YIELD ANOTHER ROUND OF SCATTERED SHOWERS & T-STORMS TUESDAY AFTN/EVE. WENT SLIGHTLY COOLER WITH TEMPS ON TUE, WITH EXPECTATION OF INCREASING AFTN CONVECTION. HIGHS MID 80S NORTH...UPPER 80S TO NR 90 SOUTH.  
COLD FRONT EXITS THE COAST TO BEGIN THE EXTENDED PERIOD...BRINGING AN END TO ANY PRECIP CHANCES WEDS MORNING. THE SRN PORTION OF THE FRONT STALLS ACROSS THE GULF STATES WEDS AS FLOW ALOFT BECOMES ZONAL OVER THE REGION. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE WEST WEDS...LOCATING OVER THE REGION THU. THE RESULT WILL BE DRY CONDITIONS AND NEAR SEASONABLE TEMPS WEDS AND THU. HIGHS WED LOW 80S INLAND AND MID- UPPER 70S NEAR THE COAST. SLIGHTLY COOLER THU WITH N-NE FLOW WITH HIGHS MID- UPPER 70S INLAND TO UPPER 60S- LOW 70S NEAR THE COAST.  SHORTWAVE ENERGY PROGGED TO SHEAR AS IT TRAVERSES THE GULF STATES THU. MEDIUM RANGE GUIDANCE INDICATING A WAVE OF LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPING ALONG THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY LATE THU-THU NIGHT OVER THE SE STATES IN RESPONSE TO THE SHORTWAVE. BASED ON THE LACK OF UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT AND RATHER FLAT FLOW...TEND TO THINK BEST PRECIP CHANCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WEAK WAVE WILL STAY SOUTH OF THE LOCAL AREA. WILL ONLY RETAIN SLIGHT CHANCE POPS OVER NE NC THU NIGHT AND SE VA/NE NC FRI. OTHERWISE...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION INTO NEW ENGLAND FRI-SAT. THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY KEEPS SUPPRESSED BACK TO THE SOUTH...RESULTING IN DRY CONDITIONS AND NEAR SEASONABLE NORMAL TEMPS AGAIN FRI-SAT. HIGHS FRI IN THE MID- UPPER 70S INLAND AND UPPER 60S TO LOW 70S COASTAL AREAS. HIGHS SAT IN THE LOW 80S INLAND AND LOW-MID 70S COASTAL AREAS. LOWS WEDS NIGHT-SAT NIGHT GENERALLY IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOW 60S.

WATER VAPOR SATELLITE IMAGERY AND REGIONAL UPPER AIR PLOTS REVEAL A BROAD UPPER LEVEL TROUGH CURRENTLY CENTERED OVER THE GREAT BASIN. THE TROUGH EXTENDS WEST ACROSS THE EASTERN PACIFIC TO AROUND 130W WHERE THE UPPER LEVEL JET IS BEGINNING TO CARVE OUT A DEEPER SEGMENT TO THE TROUGH.  MODELS ARE IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT THAT SHORT WAVE RIDGING OVER THE CENTRAL CONUS WILL EVENTUALLY DEEPEN THE CURRENT TROUGH TO AROUND 25N AND RETRO IT SLIGHTLY OFF THE PACIFIC COAST BY THURSDAY. THIS WILL BE OUR NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM THAT WILL BRING US AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS...WIDESPREAD BREEZY CONDITIONS...AND SLIGHT PRECIPITATION CHANCES FOR THE END OF THE WORK WEEK.  FOR NOW...A DRIER WEST-SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT OVER THE DESERT SOUTHWEST WILL CONTINUE TO BRING MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND WARMER TEMPERATURES TO OUR FORECAST TODAY AND WEDNESDAY. DAYTIME TEMPS OVER THE LOWER DESERTS WILL PEAK BACK INTO THE LOW 90S. THE INHERITED SHORT TERM DIGITAL FORECAST/GRIDS LOOK TO BE IN STEP WITH OB/MODEL TRENDS. PREVIOUS DISCUSSION STILL APPLIES.  PREVIOUS DISCUSSION... THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...THE NEXT PACIFIC TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO MOVE ON-SHORE INTO CALIFORNIA THURSDAY. MOISTURE PROFILE AND JET SPEED/ORIENTATION WITH THIS NEXT SYSTEM APPEAR SIMILAR TO THE ONE EXITING THE AREA TODAY. NARROW RIBBON OF N-S ELEVATED MIXING RATIOS AND PWATS BEGIN TO BE DRAWN INTO THE COLORADO RIVER VALLEY THURSDAY. FCST PWATS RANGE FROM 0.5 TO 0.75 INCHES WITH A LARGE PORTION OF THIS MOISTURE AT OR ABOVE 650MB. SOUTHWESTERLY UL JET...PUSHING 100KTS AND IN THE NAEFS UPPER 90TH PERCENTILES FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...WILL TRANSITION INTO THE AREA THURSDAY...SUPPORTING ANOTHER ROUND OF BREEZY TO LOCALLY WINDY CONDITIONS. ANOTHER COOL DOWN AFTER THE TROUGH AXIS PASSAGE WILL RESULT FRIDAY AND THROUGH THE EARLY WEEKEND...KNOCKING TEMPERATURES DOWN INTO THE 80S AND EVEN A FEW 70 DEGREES READINGS ACROSS SOUTHEAST CA.  NEXT WEEK...LONGWAVE TROUGHING WILL HAVE A HOLD OVER THE WESTERN U.S. AS ADDITIONAL STORM SYSTEMS SKIRT THROUGH THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST AND GREAT BASIN. INFLUENCE OF TROUGHING WILL BE LESS NOTICEABLE ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST...ALLOWING FOR ML AND UL THICKNESSES TO RETURN TO MORE SEASONAL VALUES. SFC TEMPERATURES WILL WARM AS A RESULT...RETURNING 90 DEGREE READINGS TO AREA FOR AT LEAST A PORTION OF THE WEEK. THE EFFECT OF THE UL SPLIT-FLOW PATTERN LOOKS TO REMAIN A LITTLE WHILE LONGER...AS ADDITIONAL TROUGHING MAY BRUSH PAST AT LEAST THROUGH THE WESTERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR MIDWEEK. OVERALL...CONDITIONS LOOK TO MOSTLY REMAIN ON THE DRY SIDE WITH GOOD CHANCES FOR TEMPERATURES AT OR JUST BELOW SEASONAL NORMALS.  
SAN DIEGO...WESTERN RIVERSIDE AND SOUTHWESTERN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES...  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWED AREAS OF THICK MARINE CLOUDS THIS MORNING OVER THE COASTAL WATERS AND INLAND ONTO THE COASTAL SLOPES. THE 12Z MIRAMAR SOUNDING HAD A DEEP...NEARLY SATURATED LAYER FROM THE SFC TO 3500 FT...TOPPED BY A WEAK INVERSION. AT 8 AM PDT...SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENTS WERE RUNNING 4-6 MBS ONSHORE TO THE DESERTS...SUPPORTING WINDS OF NEAR 30 MPH WITH ISOLATED GUSTS TO 45 MPH ON THE WINDIER DESERT SLOPES.  A BROAD TROUGH COVERING MUCH OF THE WEST THIS MORNING WILL BE REINFORCED BY A WEAK TROUGH OFF THE PACIFIC ON WED...FOLLOWED BY A STRONGER...DIGGING TROUGH BY FRI. THE SERIES OF SYSTEMS WILL KEEP HEIGHTS DEPRESSED AND THE MARINE LAYER ELEVATED. THE SYSTEM LATER IN THE WEEK WILL CUT OFF OFFSHORE...FORMING A LOW PRESSURE CENTER THAT WILL MOVE EAST OVER THE REGION ON FRI. THERE REMAINS SOME UNCERTAINTY WITH THE EXACT TRACK OF THE DYNAMIC JET ENERGY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM...WHICH COULD MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE AMOUNT OF SHOWER ACTIVITY WE SEE OVER SOCAL. THE GFS/NAM SOLUTIONS ARE BULLISH FOR MODERATE TO LOCALLY HEAVY SHOWERS AND EVEN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS...WHILE THE LATEST 00Z ECMWF SOLUTION TAKES THE BEST DYNAMICS JUST TO THE SOUTH...ACROSS NORTHERN BAJA.  IN THE MEANTIME EXPECT A FAIRLY DEEP SATURATED LAYER...BUILDING TO AROUND 5K FT BY THU. THIS WILL SUPPORT WIDESPREAD CUMULUS/ STRATOCUMULUS CLOUD DEVELOPMENT AND PATCHY DRIZZLE AT TIMES. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN SOME 10-15 DEGREES F OR MORE BELOW AVERAGE INLAND WHERE CLOUDS PREVAIL THROUGH FRI.  DEPENDING ON THE TRACK OF THE DEVELOPING LOW ON FRI...MODERATE TO LOCALLY HEAVY...FAST MOVING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY IN THE MORNING. IF THE MORE SOUTHERLY TRACK OF THE JET ENERGY ROUNDING THE SYSTEM ADVERTISED BY THE 00Z ECMWF VERIFIES...SHOWERS WOULD BE LIGHTER.  AS THE LOW DEPARTS THE REGION NEXT WEEKEND...THERE IS MODEST RECOVERY IN HEIGHTS/THICKNESS...AND A SLOW DECREASE IN THE MARINE LAYER DEPTH FOR GRADUAL WARMING INTO NEXT WEEK.  
FOG PRODUCT IS SHOWING LOW CLOUDS PRESENT AROUND MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. THE SAN JOSE STATE AND THE SAN FRANCISCO EXPLORATORIUM RADIOMETERS ARE BOTH INDICATING A SUBTLE INVERSION AT APPROXIMATELY 3000 FEET WITH A LOW CLOUD LAYER PRESENT. THE CURRENT SATELLITE WATER VAPOR IMAGE IS SHOWING A BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE POSITIONED OVER THE WESTERN CONUS...WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM POSITIONED ALONG THE ALEUTIANS AND A SECONDS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING THROUGH THE GULF OF ALASKA.  THE 0000Z ECMWF AND 0600Z GFS40 HAVE INITIALIZED WELL WITH THE CURRENT SYNOPTIC WEATHER PATTERN AND REMAIN IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE WEEKEND. BOTH MODELS RETAIN A GENERALLY TROUGHY PATTERN OVER THE WESTERN CONUS THROUGH REMAINDER OF THE WORK WEEK...PROMOTING BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES FOR MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA. BOTH MODELS ALSO SLIDE THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CURRENTLY POSITIONED IN THE GULF OF ALASKA SOUTH INTO NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA BY THURSDAY. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL PROMOTE A POSSIBILITY OF SHOWERS ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY BUT LACKS THE INSTABILITY NEEDED TO SUPPORT THUNDERSTORMS.  THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM QUICKLY SLIDES EAST WITH A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILD IN OVER THE EASTERN PACIFIC AND CALIFORNIA COAST. THE BUILDING RIDGE WILL HELP TO PROVIDE MORE SEASONABLE WEATHER TO OUR AREA. THE CLIMATE PREDICTION CENTER`S 6 TO 10 DAY OUTLOOK IS FOR NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND PRECIPITATION. THE 8 TO 14 DAY OUTLOOK IS SUGGESTING A POSSIBILITY OF ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES WITH NEAR NORMAL PRECIPITATION.  

UPPER TROUGH AXIS AND SFC FRONTAL BAND CONTINUE TO CLEAR TO THE EAST THIS MORNING...GENERATING BROAD AREAS OF CONVECTION ACROSS EASTERN NM... CENTRAL TX AND EASTERN CO. DRY AIR HAS BEEN FILTERING IN AT THE SFC IN THE WAKE OF THE FRONT WITH AREA DEWPOINTS RANGING 5 TO 15 DEGREES DRIER FOR MANY SITES ACROSS THE REGION. ONLY A FEW CU LINGERING OVER FAR EASTERN GILA COUNTY...OTHERWISE 3AM SKIES ARE CLEAR. WE`LL FIND OURSELVES IN BETWEEN WEATHER SYSTEMS WITH SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT TODAY AND WEDNESDAY... CONTINUING OUR MILD AND BELOW-NORMAL TEMPERATURES ALONG WITH MOSTLY LIGHT WINDS AND PERIODS OF PASSING HIGH CLOUDS. LOWER DESERT TEMPERATURES WILL PEAK BACK INTO THE LOW 90S WITH THE FOOTHILL/HIGHER TERRAIN LOCALES IN THE MID 80S. MEANWHILE...ANOTHER PACIFIC TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO TAKE SHAPE AND DIG OFF THE SOCAL/BAJA PENINSULA COAST.  THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...THE NEXT PACIFIC TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO MOVE ON-SHORE INTO CALIFORNIA THURSDAY. MOISTURE PROFILE AND JET SPEED/ORIENTATION WITH THIS NEXT SYSTEM APPEAR SIMILAR TO THE ONE EXITING THE AREA TODAY. NARROW RIBBON OF N-S ELEVATED MIXING RATIOS AND PWATS BEGIN TO BE DRAWN INTO THE COLORADO RIVER VALLEY THURSDAY. FCST PWATS RANGE FROM 0.5 TO 0.75 INCHES WITH A LARGE PORTION OF THIS MOISTURE AT OR ABOVE 650MB. SOUTHWESTERLY UL JET...PUSHING 100KTS AND IN THE NAEFS UPPER 90TH PERCENTILES FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...WILL TRANSITION INTO THE AREA THURSDAY...SUPPORTING ANOTHER ROUND OF BREEZY TO LOCALLY WINDY CONDITIONS. ANOTHER COOL DOWN AFTER THE TROUGH AXIS PASSAGE WILL RESULT FRIDAY AND THROUGH THE EARLY WEEKEND...KNOCKING TEMPERATURES DOWN INTO THE 80S AND EVEN A FEW 70 DEGREES READINGS ACROSS SOUTHEAST CA.  NEXT WEEK...LONGWAVE TROUGHING WILL HAVE A HOLD OVER THE WESTERN U.S. AS ADDITIONAL STORM SYSTEMS SKIRT THROUGH THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST AND GREAT BASIN. INFLUENCE OF TROUGHING WILL BE LESS NOTICEABLE ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST...ALLOWING FOR ML AND UL THICKNESSES TO RETURN TO MORE SEASONAL VALUES. SFC TEMPERATURES WILL WARM AS A RESULT...RETURNING 90 DEGREE READINGS TO AREA FOR AT LEAST A PORTION OF THE WEEK. THE EFFECT OF THE UL SPLIT-FLOW PATTERN LOOKS TO REMAIN A LITTLE WHILE LONGER...AS ADDITIONAL TROUGHING MAY BRUSH PAST AT LEAST THROUGH THE WESTERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR MIDWEEK. OVERALL...CONDITIONS LOOK TO MOSTLY REMAIN ON THE DRY SIDE WITH GOOD CHANCES FOR TEMPERATURES AT OR JUST BELOW SEASONAL NORMALS.  
WEATHER WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE INTERIOR MOUNTAINS THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK WEEK AS A BROAD...BAGGY UPPER TROUGH WITH EMBEDDED WEAK IMPULSES REMAINS FIXED ON THE WEST COAST. REMNANT SHOWERS FROM YESTERDAYS ACTIVITY HAVE DIMINISHED OVERNIGHT...BUT MORE ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS PRIMARILY THE TRINITY ALPS...YOLLA BOLLYS...AND PERHAPS A FEW AS FAR WEST AS EASTERN HUMBOLDT AND DEL NORTE COUNTIES. VERY WEAK STEERING FLOW WILL LIKELY PREVENT THIS ACTIVITY FROM REACHING THE COAST...IN ADDITION TO A PERSISTENT AND DEEP MARINE LAYER. AS FOR THE STRENGTH OF THESE SHOWERS...AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED...THE LACK OF WIND SHEAR WILL PREVENT STORMS FROM BECOMING ORGANIZED. HOWEVER...AMPLE MOISTURE TO THE TUNE OF .75 TO .85 INCHES OF PWAT AND CAPE APPROACHING 1000 J/KG IN PLACES SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR BRIEF HEAVY RAIN AND A FEW STRIKES OF LIGHTNING. ALONG THE COAST...CLOUDY AND COOL CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST DUE TO A DEEP MARINE LAYER...ALTHOUGH A FEW PLACES MAY SEE LOW CLOUDS SCATTER OUT BRIEFLY DURING THE AFTERNOON.  EXPECT MORE OF THE SAME TOMORROW AFTERNOON...ALTHOUGH A REINFORCING UPPER LOW MOVING TO OUR SOUTH MAY INCREASE EASTERLY FLOW ALOFT JUST ENOUGH TO CARRY SHOWERS A BIT CLOSER TO THE COAST...ESPECIALLY IN DEL NORTE COUNTY AND SOUTHWEST OREGON.  DIURNALLY DRIVEN INTERIOR SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH FRIDAY AFTERNOON...BUT A MARKED DECREASE IN COVERAGE IS EXPECTED SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AS AN UPPER RIDGE NUDGES THE PERSISTENT WEST COAST TROUGH FARTHER EASTWARD INTO THE GREAT BASIN.  INLAND TEMPERATURES SHOULD ALSO WARM A FEW DEGREES AS THIS RIDGING BUILDS IN...ENOUGH TO BRING THE VALLEYS INTO THE UPPER 70S TO NEAR 80 IN PLACES BY MEMORIAL DAY.  WHILE ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS PRIMARILY THE TRINITY HORN AND PERHAPS THE YOLLA BOLLYS...NW CALIFORNIA SHOULD SEE DRY AND PLEASANT WEATHER THROUGH THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND.  
SAN DIEGO...WESTERN RIVERSIDE AND SOUTHWESTERN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES...  TROUGHS OF LOW PRESSURE WILL REMAIN NEAR THE CALIFORNIA COAST MAINTAINING STRONGER ONSHORE FLOW INTO THE WEEKEND WITH BELOW AVERAGE INLAND HIGH TEMPERATURES...A DEEPER MARINE LAYER WITH AREAS OF NIGHT AND MORNING LOW CLOUDS AND PATCHY FOG EXTENDING WELL INLAND WITH SLOW AND SOMETIMES LIMITED AFTERNOON CLEARING...AND LOCALLY GUSTY WEST WINDS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS. FOR LATE THURSDAY AND EARLY FRIDAY...A WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING INLAND THROUGH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND NORTHERN BAJA WILL ALSO BRING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS.  FOR THE WEEKEND THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK...LOW PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY WEAKEN WITH SLOW INLAND WARMING AND A GRADUALLY SHALLOWER MARINE LAYER.  
FOG PRODUCT IS SHOWING LOW CLOUDS PRESENT AROUND MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. THE SAN JOSE STATE AND THE SAN FRANCISCO EXPLORATORIUM RADIOMETERS ARE BOTH INDICATING A SUBTLE INVERSION AT APPROXIMATELY 3000 FEET WITH A LOW CLOUD LAYER PRESENT. THE CURRENT SATELLITE WATER VAPOUR IMAGE IS SHOWING A BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE POSITIONED OVER THE WESTERN CONUS...WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM POSITIONED ALONG THE ALEUTIANS AND A SECONDS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING THROUGH THE GULF OF ALASKA.  THE 0000Z ECMWF AND 0600Z GFS40 HAVE INITIALIZED WELL WITH THE CURRENT SYNOPTIC WEATHER PATTERN AND REMAIN IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE WEEKEND. BOTH MODELS RETAIN A GENERALLY TROUGHY PATTERN OVER THE WESTERN CONUS THROUGH REMAINDER OF THE WORK WEEK...PROMOTING BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES FOR MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA. BOTH MODELS ALSO SLIDE THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CURRENTLY POSITIONED IN THE GULF OF ALASKA SOUTH INTO NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA BY THURSDAY. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL PROMOTE A POSSIBILITY OF SHOWERS ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY BUT LACKS THE INSTABILITY NEEDED TO SUPPORT THUNDERSTORMS.  THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM QUICKLY SLIDES EAST WITH A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILD IN OVER THE EASTERN PACIFIC AND CALIFORNIA COAST. THE BUILDING RIDGE WILL HELP TO PROVIDE MORE SEASONABLE WEATHER TO OUR AREA. THE CLIMATE PREDICTION CENTER`S 6 TO 10 DAY OUTLOOK IS FOR NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND PRECIPITATION. THE 8 TO 14 DAY OUTLOOK IS SUGGESTING A POSSIBILITY OF ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES WITH NEAR NORMAL PRECIPITATION.  
OVER THE WEST. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THE NEXT LOW NOW LOCATED NEAR 35N/135W MOVING TO THE EAST AND FORECAST MODELS BRING THIS FEATURE TOWARDS THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST ON WEDNESDAY AND THEN ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. THE TRACK LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO THE PAST COUPLE OF SYSTEMS WITH PRECIPITATION TARGETING SOUTHERN, BUT NOT CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. ENOUGH MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY REMAIN OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND KERN COUNTY DESERT ON THURSDAY.  MEANWHILE OVER THE SIERRA, THE SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM THREAT REMAINS FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY AS INSTABILITY MAXIMIZES AFTER 18Z AND LINGERS INTO SUNSET. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN BELOW NORMAL IN THE COOL AIRMASS.  AFTER THE LOW EJECTS ON FRIDAY, HEIGHTS BEGIN TO BUILD OVER THE REGION AND A WARMING TREND TO NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL COMMENCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE THREAT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DIMINISH OVER THE SIERRA.  
CALIFORNIA INTERIOR IS MOVING INTO NEVADA. SHOWERS DEVELOPED ALONG THE COASTAL RANGE OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS AFTERNOON ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE LOW AND A COUPLE OF THESE SHOWERS SPREAD INTO THE NORTH BAY MOUNTAINS. A DEEP MARINE LAYER AND ONSHORE FLOW BEHIND THE LOW KEPT STRATUS IN OVER THE SFO BAY AREA THROUGH THE ENTIRE DAY. TEMPERATURES WERE GENERALLY 5-10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL.  WEAK UPPER LEVEL TROFFING WILL CONTINUE OVER THE AREA TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. RESIDUAL MOISTURE OVER THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINS FROM THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS WILL KEEP THE POSSIBILITY OF ISOLATED AFTERNOON SHOWERS IN THE NORTH BAY MOUNTAINS. NOT MUCH CHANGE EXPECTED AS FAR AS THE STRATUS GOES WITH LOW CLOUDS EXTENDING WELL INLAND WITH SOME AFTERNOON CLEARING. SO CONTINUED COOL TEMPERATURES.  ANOTHER UPPER LOW WILL APPROACH THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL WATERS ON THURSDAY WITH LATEST MODELS TAKING THE SYSTEM INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. THIS SYSTEM LIKE THE PREVIOUS ONE IS ALSO LIMITED IN MOISTURE BUT IF THE MODELS VERIFY THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVECTIVE SHOWERS WOULD FOCUS MORE ON THE MONTEREY AND SAN BENITO COUNTY MOUNTAINS.  THE LOW MOVES EAST ON FRIDAY AND SHOWER CHANCES SHOULD END BUT STILL NOT EXPECTING MUCH OF A WARM UP. WEAK UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL MOVE OVER THE DISTRICT FOR THE LONG WEEKEND FINALLY BRINGING WARMER TEMPERATURES.  
SYNOPSIS... LOW PRESSURE ALOFT WILL REMAIN OVER CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK WEEK, BRINGING BELOW AVERAGE TEMPERATURES AND ROUNDS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS, MAINLY IN THE AFTERNOONS AND EVENINGS. PRECIPITATION CHANCES DECREASE OVER THE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND ALTHOUGH A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE.  SHORT TERM... A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE REMAINS OVER THE WEST. AN UPPER DISTURBANCE OVER SOUTHEAST CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN NEVADA IS ROTATING AROUND THE TROUGH, BRINGING INCREASED DIVERGENCE ALOFT AND HELPING TO INITIATE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER SOUTHERN AND EASTERN NEVADA.  FOR NORTHEAST CALIFORNIA AND WESTERN NEVADA, ACTIVITY IS RESTRICTED EARLY THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE BEST FORCING SOUTH AND EAST OF THE AREA. HOWEVER, SCATTERED SHOWERS SHOULD STILL DEVELOP GIVEN THE MOIST AND WEAKLY UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE, ESPECIALLY FOR EASTERN CALIFORNIA AND FAR WESTERN NEVADA WHERE THE HRRR AND NAM SHOW A LIGHT WESTERLY FLOW OFF THE SIERRA (TO AID LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE AND UPWARD MOTION) INTO THE EVENING. AS FAR AS THUNDERSTORMS, LOW FREEZING LEVELS AND WEAK INSTABILITY MAKE IT HARD TO RULE OUT BRIEF, ISOLATED CELLS. ANY STORMS THIS EVENING WILL BE WEAK WITH THE MAIN THREAT BEING LIGHTNING AND LARGE QUANTITIES OF SMALL, SOFT HAIL (GRAUPEL TECHNICALLY).  LATE TONIGHT, THE HRRR AND LESS-SO THE GFS AND NAM ARE INDICATING WRAP-AROUND PRECIPITATION OVER NORTHEAST CALIFORNIA AND NORTHWEST NEVADA AS THE UPPER LOW ADVANCES INTO EASTERN NEVADA. WITH THIS IN MIND, I HAVE LEFT IN SCATTERED SHOWERS NORTH OF RENO AND FALLON WITH ISOLATED COVERAGE ELSEWHERE.  TUESDAY, THE REGION IS BETWEEN UPPER WAVES. HOWEVER, MOISTURE REMAINS IN PLACE AND BETTER HEATING IS POSSIBLE WITH LITTLE UPPER FORCING ALLOWING FOR LESS/THINNER CLOUD COVER IN THE MORNING. THIS SHOULD FACILITATE SCATTERED SHOWERS IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING, WITH A LOW CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS.  WEDNESDAY, THE BEST UPPER FORCING OF THE SHORT TERM IS EXPECTED AS ANOTHER DISTURBANCE RELOADS THE SOUTHWEST CONUS TROUGH. THE DISTURBANCE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE FROM SOUTH TO NORTH THROUGH CALIFORNIA WITH THE BEST FORCING IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. WITH THIS IN MIND, I HAVE BUMPED POP A BIT MORE OVER MUCH OF FAR WESTERN NEVADA AND EASTERN CALIFORNIA WITH NUMEROUS SHOWERS EXPECTED BY AFTERNOON. WITH THE FORCING, I WOULD EXPECTED AT LEAST ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WITH HIGHER COVERAGE POSSIBLE IF WE CAN GET DECENT MORNING HEATING (CLEARER SKIES). SNYDER  LONG TERM...THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY...  BY THURSDAY AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL AGAIN BE ALONG THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COAST. THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BRING WIDESPREAD CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION, ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS, AND BELOW AVERAGE DAYTIME TEMPERATURES. THURSDAY CURRENTLY LOOKS TO BE THE WETTEST DAY WITH MOISTURE WRAPPING AROUND THE LOW PRESSURE AND BANKING AGAINST THE SIERRA FROM THE EAST. RELATIVELY DEEP MOISTURE AND UPSLOPE FLOW COULD ALLOW SOME AREAS TO PICK UP ANOTHER ROUND OF SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION, ESPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL SIERRA.  BY FRIDAY THE LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE INTO SOUTHERN NEVADA BRINGING NORTHERLY FLOW TO THE AREA. THIS WILL DECREASE THE CHANCE OF SIGNIFICANT QPF IN THE SIERRA, BUT WILL STILL ALLOW WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION TO WESTERN NEVADA AND THE SIERRA.  FOR THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND...  CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE ON THE DECREASE BY THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND AS THE LOW PRESSURE MOVES INTO THE ROCKIES, BUT WITH SOME RESIDUAL MOISTURE AND INCREASING TEMPERATURES THERE IS STILL A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY IN SIERRA AND WESTERN NEVADA THROUGH THE WEEKEND. SIGNIFICANT MODEL DISCREPANCIES EXIST BY THE WEEKEND SO FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS CURRENTLY LOW ON THE BEST AREA FOR THUNDERSTORM CHANCES.  EXPECT A WARMING TREND THROUGH THE WEEKEND WITH DAYTIME TEMPERATURES RIGHT AROUND SEASONAL AVERAGES WITH MID 70`S IN WESTERN NEVADA AND MID 60`S IN THE SIERRA. BY MONDAY WESTERN NEVADA VALLEYS COULD HIT 80 WITH SIERRA VALLEYS REACHING 70. TOLBY  AVIATION...  SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED THROUGHOUT THE SIERRA AND WESTERN NEVADA THROUGH THIS EVENING. LOW CLOUD DECKS AND RAIN SHOWERS WILL CREATE SOME MOUNTAIN OBSCURATION IN THE SIERRA. GENERALLY LIGHT WEST WINDS WITH THE CHANCE OF GUSTS TO AROUND 30 KTS NEAR THUNDERSTORMS. TOLBY  
SAN DIEGO...WESTERN RIVERSIDE AND SOUTHWESTERN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES...  THE WEAK TROUGH PASSING THROUGH THE AREA TODAY DID NOT DO MUCH IN THE PRECIPITATION DEPARTMENT...BUT IT DID GENERATE STRONG WEST WINDS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS THIS EVENING. WIND GUSTS RANGED FROM 40 TO 50 MPH IN THE WIND PRONE AREAS. A PEAK WIND GUST OF 64 MPH WAS RECORDED AT EDOM HILL IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY AT 8 PM. WIND GUSTS AT PALM SPRINGS AND THERMAL WERE AROUND 30 MPH THIS EVENING.  THE NEGATIVE TILT TROUGH AXIS OVER SE CA THIS EVENING WILL MOVE EAST INTO ARIZONA OVERNIGHT. THE SOUTHERN BRANCH OF THE JET WILL REMAIN OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK. SOME OF THIS WIND ENERGY WILL TRANSFER TOWARD THE SURFACE WITH AFTERNOON MIXING AND RESULT IN GUSTY AFTERNOON AND EVENING WINDS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS EACH DAY.  THE GFS AND EUROPEAN MODELS REMAIN CONSISTENT WITH THE TRACK AND STRENGTH OF THE STRONGEST SHORTWAVE THAT WILL MOVE INLAND ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM ON THURSDAY WITH NEAR SATURATION TO 6000 FEET THURSDAY NIGHT. THE VORT MAX...STRONGER ONSHORE FLOW AND DEEPER MOIST LAYER WILL BRING A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO THE COAST. THE BEST CHANCE FOR MEASURABLE PRECIP WILL BE ON THE WEST FACING MTNS SLOPES WHERE MIDLEVEL SOUTHWEST FLOW.  A DEEP MARINE LAYER WILL REMAIN IN PLACE SATURDAY...BUT DRY AND WARMER WEATHER WITH A SHALLOWER MARINE LAYER WILL FOLLOW ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY WITH WEAK RIDGING OVER THE SOUTHWEST.  
CALIFORNIA INTERIOR IS MOVING INTO NEVADA. SHOWERS DEVELOPED ALONG THE COASTAL RANGE OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS AFTERNOON ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE LOW AND A COUPLE OF THESE SHOWERS SPREAD INTO THE NORTH BAY MOUNTAINS. A DEEP MARINE LAYER AND ONSHORE FLOW BEHIND THE LOW KEPT STRATUS IN OVER THE SFO BAY AREA THROUGH THE ENTIRE DAY. TEMPERATURES WERE GENERALLY 5-10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL.  WEAK UPPER LEVEL TROFFING WILL CONTINUE OVER THE AREA TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. RESIDUAL MOISTURE OVER THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINS FROM THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS WILL KEEP THE POSSIBILITY OF ISOLATED AFTERNOON SHOWERS IN THE NORTH BAY MOUNTAINS. NOT MUCH CHANGE EXPECTED AS FAR AS THE STRATUS GOES WITH LOW CLOUDS EXTENDING WELL INLAND WITH SOME AFTERNOON CLEARING. SO CONTINUED COOL TEMPERATURES.  ANOTHER UPPER LOW WILL APPROACH THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL WATERS ON THURSDAY WITH LATEST MODELS TAKING THE SYSTEM INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. THIS SYSTEM LIKE THE PREVIOUS ONE IS ALSO LIMITED IN MOISTURE BUT IF THE MODELS VERIFY THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVECTIVE SHOWERS WOULD FOCUS MORE ON THE MONTEREY AND SAN BENITO COUNTY MOUNTAINS.  THE LOW MOVES EAST ON FRIDAY AND SHOWER CHANCES SHOULD END BUT STILL NOT EXPECTING MUCH OF A WARMUP. WEAK UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL MOVE OVER THE DISTRICT FOR THE LONG WEEKEND FINALLY BRINGING WARMER TEMPERATURES.  
COOL DAY FOR MUCH OF THE BAY AREA WITH TEMPERATURES FROM THE UPPER 50S TO UPPER 60S. YOU HAVE TO GO INTO THE INTERIOR VALLEYS OF MONTEREY COUNTY TO FIND LOWER 70S WITH A CHILLY 60 DEGREES AT THE LIVERMORE AIRPORT AT 1 PM. THE COOL WEATHER IS COURTESY OF AN UPPER LOW CENTERED OVER THE BAY AREA THAT IS GENERATING LOTS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE SIERRA AND NORTHERN MOUNTAINS. LOCALLY THE CLOSEST CELL IS EAST OF MT HAMILTON WITH A FEW CELLS UP NEAR THE GEYSERS IN EXTREME NE SONOMA COUNTY.  RIGHT NOW NOT EXPECTING MANY CHANGES IN THE UPPER PATTERN FOR TUESDAY AND WEDS WITH A WEAK TROUGH OVER THE WEST COAST. TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO RUN COOL...ESPECIALLY INLAND WITH BAY AREA TEMPS GENERALLY IN THE 60S AND NOT MUCH VARIATION FROM THE COAST TO THE INLAND VALLEYS. RIGHT NOW THE MESOSCALE MODELS AREN`T GENERATING ANY SHOWERS FOR TUE/WED BUT SIMILAR TO WHATS OCCURRING THIS AFTERNOON CANT RULE OUT SOME TOWERING CUMULUS TURNING INTO SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER SOME OF THE REMOTE INTERIOR HILLS.  WILL BE WATCHING ANOTHER WELL ORGANIZED SHORTWAVE APPROACH THE CENTRAL COAST BY THURSDAY. MODELS ONCE AGAIN GENERATE MOST OF THE ASSOCIATED PRECIP OVER THE SIERRA BUT INDICATE SOME SOME SHOWER CHANCES POSSIBLE OVER THE EASTERN HILLS. DIDN`T CHANGE FORECAST TOO MUCH EXCEPT TO ADD SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS TO SAN BENITO HILLS FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON. THE LOW WILL MOVE EAST BY FRIDAY BUT STILL NOT EXPECTING MUCH OF A WARM UP EVEN THOUGH SHOWER CHANCES ESSENTIALLY END.  THE WEATHER LOOKS SEASONABLE FOR MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND...THE ECMWF SOLUTION DROPS A LOW DOWN THE SPINE OF THE SIERRA BY SUNDAY KEEPING THE BAY AREA WITH SOME DRY NORTH WINDS. HOWEVER NO WARM UP OF NOTE LOOKS TO OCCUR WITH TEMPERATURES CONTINUING TO RUN NEAR OR SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL.  
SAN DIEGO...WESTERN RIVERSIDE AND SOUTHWESTERN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES...  AREAS OF LOW CLOUDS REMAIN IN MUCH OF THE COASTAL BASIN THIS AFTERNOON WITH GREATEST COVERAGE IN THE NORTHERN COUNTIES. A FEW CUMULUS ARE BEGINNING TO FORM OVER THE SAN BERNARDINO MOUNTAINS AND SUFFICIENT MID-LEVEL MOISTURE/INSTABILITY ABOVE 700 MB REMAINS FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A FEW SHOWERS OVER THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS THIS AFTERNOON. THE TROUGH PASSING THROUGH THE AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT WILL RESULT IN GUSTY WINDS THROUGH THE SAN GORGONIO PASS AND ALONG THE DESERT SLOPES OF THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY MOUNTAINS WITH LOCAL GUSTS 50 TO 55 MPH. A WIND ADVISORY HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR THESE AREAS TONIGHT THROUGH TOMORROW MORNING.  A SERIES OF WEAK UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS WILL MOVE THROUGH THE WEST THIS WEEK. THE FIRST WILL TRAVERSE CALIFORNIA TODAY...THE SECOND WILL BE JUST OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WITH A TRAILING WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING INLAND THROUGH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. THIS WILL CONTINUE BELOW AVERAGE INLAND TEMPERATURES AS WELL AS STRONGER ONSHORE FLOW WITH GUSTY WEST WINDS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS AT TIMES. THE PATTERN WILL ALSO MAINTAIN A DEEP MARINE LAYER WITH NIGHT AND MORNING COASTAL LOW CLOUDS AND PATCHY FOG EXTENDING ONTO THE COASTAL MOUNTAIN SLOPES WITH SLOW AND SOMETIMES LIMITED AFTERNOON CLEARING. A CHANCE OF SHOWERS ALONG AND WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS WILL ACCOMPANY THE FINAL WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING INLAND THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. THE LATEST MODEL RUNS STILL SHOW LIMITED MOISTURE WITH THIS SYSTEM DESPITE GOOD DYNAMICS SO WILL KEEP PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS MOSTLY LIGHT AT THIS POINT.  DRY WITH A WARMING TREND FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS AND HIGH TEMPERATURES REBOUND TO NEAR SEASONAL AVERAGES FOR MEMORIAL DAY.  
CA WITH VORTICITY MAXIMA MOVING N-NW OVER THE LOCAL AREA. WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES OF AROUND .60" AND LINGERING WEAK INSTABILITY...DYNAMIC FORCING IS PRODUCING A BAND OF LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS WESTWARD ACROSS THE COASTAL MOUNTAINS AND HEADING TOWARD HUMBOLDT BAY.  EXISTING CLOUD COVER MAY DELAY DEEPER CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT...BUT EXPECT MORE SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP LATER THIS AFTERNOON. STORM MOTION WILL BE TOWARD THE W-NW TODAY...AND THIS SHOULD ALLOW ADDITIONAL SHOWERS TO CONTINUE ADVECTING TOWARD THE REDWOOD COAST. HIGHEST INSTABILITY IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN OVER THE INLAND AREAS...AND IT IS UNCLEAR IF ANY THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE ABLE TO REACH THE COAST AS THEY WILL MOVE INTO A LESS UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE. THEY MAY AT LEAST MAKE IT TO THE W MOUNTAINS TONIGHT. THE UPPER LOW TO OUR S WILL GRADUALLY FILL INTO MID-WEEK...LEAVING A BAGGY TROF OVER THE AREA. MORE AFTERNOON AND EVENING THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED ON TUE AND WED. STORM MOTION WILL BE VERY SLOW ON TUE AND THEN MORE S TO N ON WED. THIS SHOULD KEEP THE FOCUS OF CONVECTION BACK OVER TRINITY COUNTY AND THE YOLLA BOLLYS. ANOTHER UPPER LOW WILL DEVELOP OFFSHORE THE N OR CENTRAL CA COAST BY WED. NAM MODEL SOUNDINGS FOR E TRINITY COUNTY DEPICT THE DEEPEST CAPE ON WED AFTERNOON...POSSIBLY INTO THE HAIL GROWTH REGION. HOWEVER...THE CAPE AREA IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN FAIRLY NARROW. /SEC/JT   
MAIN UPPER LOW CENTER OVER INYO COUNTY KEEPING UNSETTLED CONDITIONS ACROSS OUR AREA TODAY. MOST OF THE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY SO FAR HAS BEEN AHEAD OF THE LOW ON THE WAA SIDE OVER SOUTHERN AND EASTERN NV. A FEW STRIKES HAVE BEEN NOTED IN THE SOUTHERN SIERRA NEVADA ALREADY THIS AFTERNOON WHERE MOISTURE...INSTABILITY AND CAPE HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT FOR THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. TEMPERATURES HAVE GENERALLY BEEN RUNNING 4-8 DEG F BELOW YDAY OVER THE SOUTHERN SIERRA NEVADA WHERE MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES PREVAIL TODAY. ELSEWHERE...SKIES HAVE CLEARED OUT FOR THE MOST PART AND TEMPERATURES ARE RUNNING FAIRLY CLOSE TO YDAY.  THE 12Z WRF IS INDICATING THE UPPER LOW CENTER WILL LIFT SLOWLY NORTHEAST TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. AS IT DOES SO...THE UPPER FLOW ALOFT WILL BECOME MORE WESTERLY AND DRIER RESULTING IN DECREASED CLOUD COVER AND MOUNTAIN THUNDERSTORM CHANCES ON TUESDAY. DAYTIME TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER ON TUESDAY AS A SHORTWAVE RIDGE OVER SOCAL RESULTS IN INCREASED HEIGHTS AND THICKNESSES OVER OUR AREA.  ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH IS PROGGED TO APPROACH CENTRAL CA ON WEDNESDAY PROVIDING FOR INCREASED POTENTIAL FOR MOUNTAIN CONVECTION. THIS SYSTEM WILL MOVE SLOWLY INLAND ON THURSDAY AND BRING INCREASED MID-LEVEL MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY TO OUR AREA FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS OVER THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE SOUTHERN SIERRA NEVADA. TEMPERATURES ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO LOWER AGAIN TO SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW SEASONAL NORMALS.  ALTHOUGH TIMING DIFFERENCES EXIST...THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE INDICATING THIS TROUGH MOVING EAST OF OUR REGION BY THE END OF THE WEEK WITH AN UPPER RIDGE AMPLIFYING OFF THE CA COAST. THE RIDGE IS PROGGED TO BUILD INLAND OVER THE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND RESULTING IN A WARMING AND DRYING TREND ACROSS OUR AREA. TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE NEAR SEASONAL NORMALS ON SUNDAY AND MEMORIAL DAY WITH DECREASING MOUNTAIN THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE EACH DAY OVER THE WEEKEND AS DRIER AIR BUILDS INTO OUR AREA.  
SAN DIEGO...WESTERN RIVERSIDE AND SOUTHWESTERN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES...  AREAS OF LOW CLOUDS REMAIN IN MUCH OF THE COASTAL BASIN THIS AFTERNOON WITH GREATEST COVERAGE IN THE NORTHERN COUNTIES. A FEW CUMULUS ARE BEGINNING TO FORM OVER THE OVER THE SAN BERNARDINO MOUNTAINS AND SUFFICIENT MID-LEVEL MOISTURE/INSTABILITY ABOVE 700 MB REMAINS FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A FEW SHOWERS OVER THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS THIS AFTERNOON. THE TROUGH PASSING THROUGH THE AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT WILL RESULT IN GUSTY WINDS THROUGH THE SAN GORGONIO PASS AND ALONG THE DESERT SLOPES OF THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY MOUNTAINS WITH LOCAL GUSTS 50 TO 55 MPH. A WIND ADVISORY HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR THESE AREAS TONIGHT THROUGH TOMORROW MORNING.  A SERIES OF WEAK UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS WILL MOVE THROUGH THE WEST THIS WEEK. THE FIRST WILL TRAVERSE CALIFORNIA TODAY...THE SECOND WILL BE JUST OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WITH A TRAILING WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING INLAND THROUGH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. THIS WILL CONTINUE BELOW AVERAGE INLAND TEMPERATURES AS WELL AS STRONGER ONSHORE FLOW WITH GUSTY WEST WINDS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS AT TIMES. THE PATTERN WILL ALSO MAINTAIN A DEEP MARINE LAYER WITH NIGHT AND MORNING COASTAL LOW CLOUDS AND PATCHY FOG EXTENDING ONTO THE COASTAL MOUNTAIN SLOPES WITH SLOW AND SOMETIMES LIMITED AFTERNOON CLEARING. A CHANCE OF SHOWERS ALONG AND WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS WILL ACCOMPANY THE FINAL WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING INLAND THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. THE LATEST MODEL RUNS STILL SHOW LIMITED MOISTURE WITH THIS SYSTEM DESPITE GOOD DYNAMICS SO WILL KEEP PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS MOSTLY LIGHT AT THIS POINT.  DRY WITH A WARMING TREND FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS AND HIGH TEMPERATURES REBOUNDING TO NEAR SEASONAL AVERAGES FOR MEMORIAL DAY.  
LOW PRESSURE CONTINUES ITS SLOW EASTWARD PROGRESSION THIS AFTERNOON AND IS CENTERED OVER WESTERN NEVADA AS OF 19Z. THE BAND OF CLOUDS AND SPRINKLES THAT MOVED THROUGH THE AREA THIS MORNING HAS SHIFTED INTO NORTHERN ARIZONA ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME SHOWERS BEGINNING TO SHOW UP OVER PORTIONS OF GILA COUNTY. MEANWHILE THE DESERTS REMAIN DRY WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S.  HI-RES GUIDANCE REMAINS FIRM IN THEIR SOLUTIONS OF A DRY EVENING ACROSS THE DESERTS WITH VERY ISOLATED SHOWERS NORTH/EAST OF PHOENIX. SREF HOLDING TOUGH WITH 30-40 POPS ACROSS GILA COUNTY THIS EVENING. ELECTED TO TRIM POPS BELOW 10 PERCENT AROUND THE PHOENIX AREA AND INTO THE 10-20 PERCENT RANGE AROUND GLOBE. MLCAPES ONLY TOP OUT AROUND 100 J/KG ACROSS GILA COUNTY THIS AFTERNOON SO I OPTED TO MAINTAIN THE SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER.  FORECAST FOR MID WEEK APPEARS RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD WITH HIGH CONFIDENCE AND GOOD AGREEMENT AMONG ENSEMBLE MEMBERS. A PERSISTENT SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL BRING VARYING AMOUNTS OF HIGH CLOUDS THROUGH THURSDAY...AND WILL ALSO PREVENT STRONG RIDGING FROM PARKING OVER THE DESERT SOUTHWEST AS WOULD TYPICALLY BE THE CASE THIS TIME OF YEAR. WHILE WARMER THAN WHAT WAS SEEN THIS WEEKEND...TEMPS THROUGH THURSDAY WILL STILL BE BELOW NORMAL FOR MID MAY AND WILL ONLY REACH THE UPPER 80S/LOWER 90S EACH AFTERNOON.  MEDIUM RANGE DETERMINISTIC AND ENSEMBLE FORECASTS CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE A FAIRLY ACTIVE SOUTHERN STORM TRACK...WITH WEAK RIDGING OVER THE NE PACIFIC/NORTH AMERICAN WEST COAST AND AN ACTIVE 300MB JET UNDERCUTTING AND SPINNING OFF ADDITIONAL STORM SYSTEMS NORTH OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. BY THE LATE WEEK PERIOD...YET ANOTHER PACIFIC LOW WILL TRANSITION OFF THE PACIFIC AND INTO THE SOUTHWEST. THE MOISTURE PROFILE WITH SYSTEM IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF TODAY`S AT THIS TIME...WITH ELEVATED MOISTURE/RH FIELDS THROUGH PORTIONS OF THE MID- LEVELS AND SOMEWHAT DRY SUB-CLOUD LAYERS. ANOTHER COOL DOWN WILL RESULT FRIDAY INTO THE EARLY WEEKEND...KNOCKING TEMPERATURES DOWN INTO THE 80S AND A POTENTIAL 10 DEGREES BELOW LATE MAY NORMALS. LATE WEEKEND CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO BE ON THE DRIER SIDE IN THE WAKE OF THE NEXT SYSTEM WITH ENOUGH WARMING TO INTRODUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF HEADING BACK INTO THE 90S BY THE MEMORIAL DAY HOLIDAY.  
FEATURES A 500 MB TROUGH ALONG THE CALIFORNIA COAST WITH THE CENTER BASICALLY OVER THE BAY AREA. THIS WILL KEEP COOL TEMPERATURES IN PLACE FOR MUCH OF THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK...ESPECIALLY INLAND. CLOUDS COVER MOST OF THE BAY AREA THIS MORNING AND EXPECT ONLY PARTIAL CLEARING FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS NEAR THE COAST AND BAYS. HIGHS THIS AFTERNOON CONTINUE TO BE COOL WITH UPPER 50S BEACHES...60S MOST OF THE BAY AREA AND ONLY SOME LOWER 70S FOR THE FARTHEST INLAND VALLEYS THAT SEE SUNSHINE THIS AFTERNOON. SHOWER CHANCES REMAIN MINIMAL BUT NOT ZERO WITH SOME SLIGHT CHANCE AFTERNOON SHOWERS NEAR THE LAKE COUNTY BORDER IN FAR NORTHERN NAPA/SONOMA COUNTY THIS AFTERNOON.  DAY TO DAY CHANGES THIS WEEK WILL BE SUBTLE AND THE MAIN IDEA WILL BE MOSTLY CLOUDY MORNINGS FOLLOWED BY PARTLY CLOUDY AFTERNOONS WITH TEMPERATURES RUNNING BELOW NORMAL...ESPECIALLY INLAND. SHOWER CHANCES WILL BE BEST OVER THE MOUNTAINS TO OUR NORTH AND OVER THE SIERRA THIS WEEK. SHORTWAVE OFF THE COAST ON THURSDAY MAY BE THE BEST CHANCE FOR SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS IN OUR CWA...BUT MAINLY FOR THE FAR INTERIOR HILLS.  EARLY LOOK AHEAD TO MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND SHOWS THE TROUGH AXIS SHIFTING INLAND SLIGHTLY WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPERATURES BUT ONLY NEAR NORMAL WITH NO REAL WARM WEATHER TO SPEAK OF. LONG RANGE TRENDS SHOW ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK KEEPING TEMPERATURES NEAR TO SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL.  
CONTINUES TO BE BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES WITH A FEW PASSING SHOWERS.  RATHER INTERESTING AND PERSISTENT PATTERN CURRENTLY OVER CALIFORNIA. IF ONE WOULD LOOK AT THE 5 DAY RUNNING MEAN FOR 500 MB HEIGHT ANOMALIES YOU WOULD NOTICE A TROUGH OVER CA WITH ANOMALOUSLY LOW HEIGHTS. THE RECENT TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN RUNNING SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW NORMAL FOR MUCH OF THE BAY AREA. ADDITIONALLY...THE PERSISTENT TROUGHINESS AND PASSING STORMS BROUGHT SCATTERED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS...EVEN HIGH ELEVATION SNOW...TO MUCH OF CA. IT ALMOST REFLECTS MORE OF A WINTER TIME PATTERN THAN THE TYPICAL DRY SUMMER PATTERN WITH HIGH PRESSURE.  ALL OF THAT BEING SAID...THE LATEST FORECAST THROUGH THE WORK WEEK HOLDS ONTO THE COOL WEATHER WITH PASSING SHOWERS. ONLY MINOR TWEAKS WERE MADE TO THE FORECAST. GENERALLY SPEAKING...A BROAD UPPER LEVEL TROUGH REMAINS OVER MUCH OF THE WEST COAST AS A SERIES OF UPPER SLOWS SLIDE THROUGH WITH VARYING TRAJECTORIES. LATEST MODEL CONSENSUS PUTS THE FIRST UPPER LOW RIGHT OVER THE HEART OF THE BAY AREA TODAY. BEST LIFT AND INSTABILITY IS OVER THE NORTH BAY WITH FEW HUNDRED SFC CAPE AND NEGATIVE LI/S. ENOUGH MOISTURE AND UPPER LIFT WILL ALSO COINCIDE WITH SFC LIFT TO WARRANT A MENTION OF SHOWERS. BEST CHANCE FOR SHOWERS WILL BE LATE THIS AFTERNOON WITH PEAK HEATING. NOTE SURE IF THERE IS ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO WARRANT A MENTION OF THUNDER. BETTER INSTABILITY EXIST N AND E OF CWA...WHICH FITS WITH SPC DAY ONE TSTORM OUTLOOK. WILL HAVE TO MONITOR DEVELOPMENT LATER THIS AFTERNOON. REGARDING TEMPERATURES TODAY...ANOTHER COOL ONE WITH 50S AND 60S ALONG THE COAST AND 60S TO LOWER 70S INLAND. IN OTHER WORDS...MANY SPOTS ARE ABOUT 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL WITH SOME INTERIOR SPOTS ALMOST 20 BELOW NORMAL.  FOR THE MOST PART...COOL AND DRY CONDITIONS EXPECTED ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AS THE UPPER LOW DEPARTS TO THE EAST AND ANOTHER ONE APPROACHES FROM THE NW. DID INCLUDE A SLIGHT MENTION FOR SHOWERS FAR NORTH BAY ON WEDNESDAY AS WEAK DISTURBANCE DRIFTS INTO THE AREA. OTHERWISE...ONLY MINOR DAY TO DAY TEMPERATURES CHANGES WITH SOME LOW CLOUDS AND ONSHORE FLOW.  A BETTER CHANCE FOR PRECIP RETURNS ON THURSDAY AS ANOTHER AND SLIGHTLY STRONGER UPPER LOW SLIDES DOWN THE COAST. PASSING UPPER LOWS ARE TRICKY TO FORECAST AND CONF IS NOT THE HIGHEST FOR EXTENT OF PRECIP ON THURSDAY. LATEST MODEL GUIDANCE KEEPS THE BEST MOISTURE AND LIFT OUTSIDE OF THE CWA...OVER THE KLAMATH AND SIERRA. NONE THE LESS...DID INCLUDE SOME SHOWERS FOR THE N AND E BAY...MAINLY HIGHER TERRAIN. THAT UPPER LOW EJECTS TO THE S AND MOVES INTO SOCAL ON FRIDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS. THE EXTENDED FORECAST SHOWS SOME RIDING WITH WARM AND DRIER WEATHER FOR THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND.  
MID MORNING WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A LARGE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER CENTRAL CALIFORNIA...WITH A LEADING SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING THROUGH WESTERN ARIZONA AS OF 16Z. VIS IMAGERY AND REGIONAL RADAR MOSAIC SUGGESTS SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS ACROSS NORTHERN LA PAZ AND NORTHWEST MARICOPA COUNTIES BUT LITTLE IN THE WAY OF MEASURABLE PRECIP HAS FALLEN AT THIS POINT...MORE THAN LIKELY A FEW SPRINKLES AT MOST.  FORECAST FOR THE REST OF THE DAY REQUIRES ONLY A FEW MINOR ADJUSTMENTS...MAINLY BASED ON OBSERVATIONAL TRENDS THROUGH 16Z. TEMPS STILL LOOK ON TRACK TO TOP OUT AROUND THE 90 DEGREE MARK...WHICH WOULD PHOENIX`S FIRST 90 DEGREE DAY IN NEARLY A WEEK /MAY 13/. AS FOR PRECIP CHANCES...HRRR KEEPS ALL PRECIP CONFINED TO NORTHERN ARIZONA TODAY BUT UAWRFS...HIRESW WRF MODELS...AND GFS ALL INDICATE A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS NORTH/EAST OF PHOENIX. DO NOT WANT TO ENTIRELY REMOVE POPS GIVEN STRONG 250MB JET SUPPORT AND MODEST MERIDIONAL COMPONENT OF THE LOW LEVEL PRE-TROUGH WINDS. I WILL LEAVE 10-30 POPS IN PLACE FROM WICKENBURG TO SUNFLOWER TO GLOBE...ANY RAINFALL AMOUNTS THAT OCCUR WILL BE LIGHT.  
LOWER TROUGH HEIGHTS MOVING THROUGH THE WESTERN FORECAST AREA DURING PEAK HEATING WILL KEEP LOCALES LIKE YUMA AND EL CENTRO SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN THEIR CITY COUNTERPARTS TO THE EAST. TEMPERATURES OUT ACROSS SOUTHEAST CA TO PEAK IN THE LOW TO MID 80S...WHILE WE`LL BE IN THE UPPER 80S TO FLIRTING WITH THE 90 DEGREE MARK ACROSS SOUTH- CENTRAL AZ. THE AFOREMENTIONED UPPER JET AND DIFLUENT FLOW SET-UP WILL ALSO SUPPORT ELEVATED BREEZES DURING THE DAY PARTICULARLY MARICOPA COUNTY EASTWARD...WITH GUSTS 20 TO 30 MPH POSSIBLE. DEEPER MIXING COURTESY OF THE WINDY CONDITIONS WILL ALSO HELP NUDGE TEMPERATURES UPWARD FOR PHOENIX...COOLIDGE AND GILA BEND.  TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...THE UPPER LOW WILL BEGIN TO CLEAR EAST OF THE AREA AS WEAK RIDGING AND BROAD SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT TRANSITION INTO THE FOUR CORNERS. 500MB HEIGHTS GRADUALLY RISE TO VALUES CLOSER TO MID-MAY NORMALS AND SFC TEMPERATURES RESPOND IN KIND...HEADING BACK INTO THE 90S FOR MIDWEEK. DESPITE THE SUBTLE INCREASE IN ML THICKNESSES...STILL LOOKS LIKE IT WON`T BE ENOUGH TO PEAK OUR TEMPERATURES ABOVE NORMAL VALUES...WHICH ARE IN THE MID TO UPPER 90S FOR PHOENIX AND YUMA RESPECTIVELY.  MEDIUM RANGE DETERMINISTIC AND ENSEMBLE FORECASTS CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE A FAIRLY ACTIVE SOUTHERN STORM TRACK...WITH WEAK RIDGING OVER THE NE PACIFIC/NORTH AMERICAN WEST COAST AND AN ACTIVE 300MB JET UNDERCUTTING AND SPINNING OFF ADDITIONAL STORM SYSTEMS NORTH OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. BY THE LATE WEEK PERIOD...YET ANOTHER PACIFIC LOW WILL TRANSITION OFF THE PACIFIC AND INTO THE SOUTHWEST. THE MOISTURE PROFILE WITH SYSTEM IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF TODAY`S AT THIS TIME...WITH ELEVATED MOISTURE/RH FIELDS THROUGH PORTIONS OF THE MID- LEVELS AND SOMEWHAT DRY SUB-CLOUD LAYERS. ANOTHER COOL DOWN WILL RESULT FRIDAY INTO THE EARLY WEEKEND...KNOCKING TEMPERATURES DOWN INTO THE 80S AND A POTENTIAL 10 DEGREES BELOW LATE MAY NORMALS. LATE WEEKEND CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO BE ON THE DRIER SIDE IN THE WAKE OF THE NEXT SYSTEM WITH ENOUGH WARMING TO INTRODUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF HEADING BACK INTO THE 90S BY THE MEMORIAL DAY HOLIDAY.  
SAN DIEGO...WESTERN RIVERSIDE AND SOUTHWESTERN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES...  VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWED AREAS OF LOW CLOUDS FILLING THE COASTAL BASIN THIS MORNING WITH HOLES HERE AND THERE AND A FEW MID- LEVEL CLOUDS OVER THE UPPER DESERTS. THE MARINE LAYER DEPTH WAS AROUND 4000 FT ON THE 12Z NKX SOUNDING WITH A INVERSION OF 4 DEGREES C. PARTIAL CLEARING OF LOW CLOUDS IS EXPECTED TODAY. THERE IS ALSO SUFFICIENT MID-LEVEL MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY ABOVE 700 MB FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A FEW SHOWERS OVER THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS THIS AFTERNOON.  A SERIES OF WEAK UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS WILL MOVE THROUGH THE WEST THIS WEEK. THE FIRST WILL TRAVERSE CALIFORNIA TODAY...THE SECOND WILL BE JUST OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WITH A TRAILING WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING INLAND THROUGH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. THIS WILL CONTINUE BELOW AVERAGE INLAND TEMPERATURES AS WELL AS STRONGER ONSHORE FLOW WITH GUSTY WEST WINDS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS AT TIMES. THE PATTERN WILL ALSO MAINTAIN A DEEP MARINE LAYER WITH NIGHT AND MORNING COASTAL LOW CLOUDS AND PATCHY FOG EXTENDING ONTO THE COASTAL MOUNTAIN SLOPES WITH SLOW AND SOMETIMES LIMITED AFTERNOON CLEARING. A CHANCE OF SHOWERS ALONG AND WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS WILL ACCOMPANY THE FINAL WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING INLAND THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. AT THIS POINT PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS APPEAR MOSTLY LIGHT.  DRY WITH A WARMING TREND FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS AND HIGH TEMPERATURES REBOUNDING TO NEAR SEASONAL AVERAGES FOR MEMORIAL DAY.  
AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH LOCATED ALONG THE US WEST COAST. THIS PATTERN HAS BEEN PRODUCING GENERALLY UNSETTLED CONDITIONS ACROSS CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WITH TEMPERATURES RUNNING A FEW TO SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW CLIMO.  MODELS REMAIN CONSISTENT AS THEY SHOW ADDITIONAL IMPULSES SPINNING INLAND ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH THE END OF THIS WEEK. THIS WILL KEEP ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY DEVELOPING OVER THE SIERRA ZONES EACH DAY...WITH SUFFICIENT INSTABILITY SHOWN FOR POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS. THURSDAY WILL SEE SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM CHANCES SPREAD INTO THE KERN COUNTY MOUNTAIN AND DESERT AREAS AS WELL AS SLIGHT CHANCES FOR SHOWERS IN THE SJ VALLEY AS A DEEPER TROUGH SWINGS ACROSS SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA.  DURING THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...MODEL SOLUTIONS ARE REASONABLY CONSIST IN SHOWING A STRENGTHENING RIDGE OVER OUR AREA. THIS WILL BRING A DOWNWARD TREND IN PRECIPITATION...TO JUST SOME LINGERING SLIGHT CHANCES FOR SHOWERS NEAR THE SIERRA CREST BY MONDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN A BIT BELOW SEASONAL AVERAGES THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK...THEN TRENDING UPWARD TO AROUND NORMAL UNDER THE STRENGTHENING RIDGE.  
THE NEXT IN THE SERIES OF PACIFIC STORMS CURRENTLY EXPANDS OFF THE NORTHERN CA COAST INTO THE NORTHEAST PACIFIC...WITH THE CIRC CENTER OVER THE BAY AREA THIS EARLY AM. BROADLY DIFLUENT FLOW AROUND THE BASE OF THE SYSTEM ALREADY WORKING INTO THE FORECAST AREA PER 00Z RAOBS AND OVERNIGHT IR SATELLITE TRENDS. 00Z RAOB PWATS AND BLENDED TPW INDICATE 0.5 TO 0.75 INCH VALUES SPANNING THE AREA...IN LINE WITH EARLIER FORECASTS AND OVERNIGHT/EARLY AM MODEL FCSTS.  UPPER LOW WILL DIP SOUTHWESTWARD THROUGH THE DAY BEFORE TRACKING INTO THE GREAT BASIN...SWEEPING UPPER 560 TO MID 570DM 500MB HEIGHTS OVER SOUTHEAST CA BY MIDDAY AND INTO SOUTH-CENTRAL AZ THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. NEAR 100KT SWSTRLY JET STREAK WILL ALSO NOSE INTO AZ BY MIDDAY. WHILE THIS SYSTEM IS NOT AS MOISTURE RICH AS FRIDAY`S...FAVORABLE OROGRAPHIC ORIENTATION AND DYNAMICS SUPPORT AT LEAST SLIGHT CHANCES FOR SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN LOCALES OF THE FORECAST AREA...THE AREAS NORTH AND EAST OF PHOENIX AS WELL AS JOSHUA TREE NP. VERY SLIGHT CHANCES EXTEND INTO PORTIONS OF THE SOUTH-CENTRAL AZ DESERTS...INCLUDING PHOENIX AND GILA BEND...TO ACCOUNT FOR JET ENTRANCE DYNAMICS BUT NOT EXPECTING MUCH BY WAY OF QPF VALUES. FCST CROSS SECTIONS KEEP THE MOISTURE IN NARROW LAYER BETWEEN 600-500MB. THIS WILL RESULT IN THICKER MID-LEVEL CLOUD DECKS...PLENTY OF VIRGA AND TRACE PRECIP AMOUNTS FOR SOME THIS AFTERNOON OVER THE LOWER AZ DESERTS.  LOWER TROUGH HEIGHTS MOVING THROUGH THE WESTERN FORECAST AREA DURING PEAK HEATING WILL KEEP LOCALES LIKE YUMA AND EL CENTRO SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN THEIR CITY COUNTERPARTS TO THE EAST. TEMPERATURES OUT ACROSS SOUTHEAST CA TO PEAK IN THE LOW TO MID 80S...WHILE WE`LL BE IN THE UPPER 80S TO FLIRTING WITH THE 90 DEGREE MARK ACROSS SOUTH- CENTRAL AZ. THE AFOREMENTIONED UPPER JET AND DIFLUENT FLOW SET-UP WILL ALSO SUPPORT ELEVATED BREEZES DURING THE DAY PARTICULARLY MARICOPA COUNTY EASTWARD...WITH GUSTS 20 TO 30 MPH POSSIBLE. DEEPER MIXING COURTESY OF THE WINDY CONDITIONS WILL ALSO HELP NUDGE TEMPERATURES UPWARD FOR PHOENIX...COOLIDGE AND GILA BEND.  TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...THE UPPER LOW WILL BEGIN TO CLEAR EAST OF THE AREA AS WEAK RIDGING AND BROAD SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT TRANSITION INTO THE FOUR CORNERS. 500MB HEIGHTS GRADUALLY RISE TO VALUES CLOSER TO MID-MAY NORMALS AND SFC TEMPERATURES RESPOND IN KIND...HEADING BACK INTO THE 90S FOR MIDWEEK. DESPITE THE SUBTLE INCREASE IN ML THICKNESSES...STILL LOOKS LIKE IT WON`T BE ENOUGH TO PEAK OUR TEMPERATURES ABOVE NORMAL VALUES...WHICH ARE IN THE MID TO UPPER 90S FOR PHOENIX AND YUMA RESPECTIVELY.  MEDIUM RANGE DETERMINISTIC AND ENSEMBLE FORECASTS CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE A FAIRLY ACTIVE SOUTHERN STORM TRACK...WITH WEAK RIDGING OVER THE NE PACIFIC/NORTH AMERICAN WEST COAST AND AN ACTIVE 300MB JET UNDERCUTTING AND SPINNING OFF ADDITIONAL STORM SYSTEMS NORTH OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. BY THE LATE WEEK PERIOD...YET ANOTHER PACIFIC LOW WILL TRANSITION OFF THE PACIFIC AND INTO THE SOUTHWEST. THE MOISTURE PROFILE WITH SYSTEM IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF TODAY`S AT THIS TIME...WITH ELEVATED MOISTURE/RH FIELDS THROUGH PORTIONS OF THE MID- LEVELS AND SOMEWHAT DRY SUB-CLOUD LAYERS. ANOTHER COOL DOWN WILL RESULT FRIDAY INTO THE EARLY WEEKEND...KNOCKING TEMPERATURES DOWN INTO THE 80S AND A POTENTIAL 10 DEGREES BELOW LATE MAY NORMALS. LATE WEEKEND CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO BE ON THE DRIER SIDE IN THE WAKE OF THE NEXT SYSTEM WITH ENOUGH WARMING TO INTRODUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF HEADING BACK INTO THE 90S BY THE MEMORIAL DAY HOLIDAY.  
CONTINUES TO BE BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES WITH A FEW PASSING SHOWERS.  RATHER INTERESTING AND PERSISTENT PATTERN CURRENTLY OVER CALIFORNIA. IF ONE WOULD LOOK AT THE 5 DAY RUNNING MEAN FOR 500 MB HEIGHT ANOMALIES YOU WOULD NOTICE A TROUGH OVER CA WITH ANOMALOUSLY LOW HEIGHTS. THE RECENT TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN RUNNING SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW NORMAL FOR MUCH OF THE BAY AREA. ADDITIONALLY...THE PERSISTENT TROUGHINESS AND PASSING STORMS BROUGHT SCATTERED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS...EVEN HIGH ELEVATION SNOW...TO MUCH OF CA. IT ALMOST REFLECTS MORE OF A WINTER TIME PATTERN THAN THE TYPICAL DRY SUMMER PATTERN WITH HIGH PRESSURE.  ALL OF THAT BEING SAID...THE LATEST FORECAST THROUGH THE WORK WEEK HOLDS ONTO THE COOL WEATHER WITH PASSING SHOWERS. ONLY MINOR TWEAKS WERE MADE TO THE FORECAST. GENERALLY SPEAKING...A BROAD UPPER LEVEL TROUGH REMAINS OVER MUCH OF THE WEST COAST AS A SERIES OF UPPER SLOWS SLIDE THROUGH WITH VARYING TRAJECTORIES. LATEST MODEL CONSENSUS PUTS THE FIRST UPPER LOW RIGHT OVER THE HEART OF THE BAY AREA TODAY. BEST LIFT AND INSTABILITY IS OVER THE NORTH BAY WITH FEW HUNDRED SFC CAPE AND NEGATIVE LI/S. ENOUGH MOISTURE AND UPPER LIFT WILL ALSO COINCIDE WITH SFC LIFT TO WARRANT A MENTION OF SHOWERS. BEST CHANCE FOR SHOWERS WILL BE LATE THIS AFTERNOON WITH PEAK HEATING. NOTE SURE IF THERE IS ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO WARRANT A MENTION OF THUNDER. BETTER INSTABILITY EXIST N AND E OF CWA...WHICH FITS WITH SPC DAY ONE TSTORM OUTLOOK. WILL HAVE TO MONITOR DEVELOPMENT LATER THIS AFTERNOON. REGARDING TEMPERATURES TODAY...ANOTHER COOL ONE WITH 50S AND 60S ALONG THE COAST AND 60S TO LOWER 70S INLAND. IN OTHER WORDS...MANY SPOTS ARE ABOUT 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL WITH SOME INTERIOR SPOTS ALMOST 20 BELOW NORMAL.  FOR THE MOST PART...COOL AND DRY CONDITIONS EXPECTED ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AS THE UPPER LOW DEPARTS TO THE EAST AND ANOTHER ONE APPROACHES FROM THE NW. DID INCLUDE A SLIGHT MENTION FOR SHOWERS FAR NORTH BAY ON WEDNESDAY AS WEAK DISTURBANCE DRIFTS INTO THE AREA. OTHERWISE...ONLY MINOR DAY TO DAY TEMPERATURES CHANGES WITH SOME LOW CLOUDS AND ONSHORE FLOW.  A BETTER CHANCE FOR PRECIP RETURNS ON THURSDAY AS ANOTHER AND SLIGHTLY STRONGER UPPER LOW SLIDES DOWN THE COAST. PASSING UPPER LOWS ARE TRICKY TO FORECAST AND CONF IS NOT THE HIGHEST FOR EXTENT OF PRECIP ON THURSDAY. LATEST MODEL GUIDANCE KEEPS THE BEST MOISTURE AND LIFT OUTSIDE OF THE CWA...OVER THE KLAMATH AND SIERRA. NONE THE LESS...DID INCLUDE SOME SHOWERS FOR THE N AND E BAY...MAINLY HIGHER TERRAIN. THAT UPPER LOW EJECTS TO THE S AND MOVES INTO SOCAL ON FRIDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS. THE EXTENDED FORECAST SHOWS SOME RIDING WITH WARM AND DRIER WEATHER FOR THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND.    
SAN DIEGO...WESTERN RIVERSIDE AND SOUTHWESTERN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES...  A WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE INLAND THROUGH CALIFORNIA TODAY. A SECOND WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BE NEAR THE CALIFORNIA COAST WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WITH A TRAILING WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING INLAND THROUGH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY.  THIS WILL CONTINUE BELOW AVERAGE INLAND TEMPERATURES AND STRONGER ONSHORE FLOW WITH GUSTY WEST WINDS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS. IT WILL ALSO MAINTAIN A DEEP MARINE LAYER WITH NIGHT AND MORNING COASTAL LOW CLOUDS AND PATCHY FOG EXTENDING ONTO THE COASTAL MOUNTAIN SLOPES WITH SLOW AND SOMETIMES LIMITED AFTERNOON CLEARING. AS THE FINAL WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES INLAND ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY THROUGH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...THERE IS ALSO A CHANCE OF SHOWERS ALONG AND WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS.  DRY WITH A WARMING TREND FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY UNDER HIGH PRESSURE AS HIGH TEMPERATURES COULD RETURN TO NEAR AVERAGE FOR MEMORIAL DAY.  
POINT REYES BROUGHT MID AND HIGH CLOUDS TO THE AREA TODAY ALONG WITH A FEW AFTERNOON CONVECTIVE SHOWERS. RADAR PICKED UP AN ISOLATED SHOWER IN THE LOS PADRES NATIONAL FOREST AND ONE EAST OF MT HAMILTON WHICH BOTH QUICKLY DISSIPATED. SHOWERS WERE MORE PERSISTENT OVER SOUTHEAST SAN BENITO COUNTY AND NORTHEAST NAPA COUNTY BUT THESE SHOWERS WILL DIMINISH SHORTLY AFTER DARK. MARINE LAYER IS DEEP SO STRATUS IS EXPECTED TO SPREAD WELL INLAND TONIGHT.  THE UPPER LOW WILL MOVE INLAND MONDAY WITH THE CENTER OVER THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE AIRMASS WILL BECOME MORE STABLE OVER OUR CWA WITH CONVECTION FOCUSED ON THE SIERRAS MONDAY BUT MODELS INDICATE A POSSIBILITY THAT SOME OF THE SHOWERS FROM THE SIERRAS COULD WRAP AROUND THE LOW INTO THE NORTH BAY MOUNTAINS LATE IN THE AFTERNOON.  DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AS THE LOW MOVES FURTHER EAST BUT NIGHT AND MORNING LOW CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE FROM ONSHORE FLOW BEHIND THE LOW. ANOTHER UPPER LOW IS FORECAST TO DROP SOUTHEAST INTO THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL WATERS ON THURSDAY. STILL UNCERTAIN WHETHER THIS LOW WILL TRACK INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR INTO OUR CWA BUT EITHER WAY THIS WILL RENEW A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN. THE LOW WILL MOVE INLAND ON FRIDAY AND WEAK RIDGING ALOFT WILL MOVE OVER THE AREA FOR THE WEEKEND.  TEMPERATURES WILL BE COOL AND BELOW NORMAL THROUGH THURSDAY THEN A WARMING TREND GOING INTO THE LONG WEEKEND.  
CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS PREVAIL ACROSS THE DESERT SOUTHWEST THIS EVENING. LATEST 00Z TUCSON SOUNDING SHOWS SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AHEAD OF A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OFF THE WEST COAST WITH ALL MOISTURE PARAMETERS WITHIN THE CLIMO LOWER AND UPPER QUARTILES. FORECAST REMAINS ON TRACK. ONLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SHORT-TERM TEMPERATURES AND DEWPOINTS WERE NEEDED THIS EVENING.  
WEAK SHORTWAVE RIDGING IS EVIDENT ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY THIS AFTERNOON...AS THE REGION SITS BETWEEN TWO UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS. THE STORM SYSTEM THAT BROUGHT COOL TEMPERATURES AND RECORD RAINFALL TO THE REGION ON FRIDAY HAS LONG SINCE MOVED OUT INTO THE UPPER PLAINS...MEANWHILE A BROAD UPPER LOW WAS DEEPENING OFF THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COAST. IN BETWEEN...SKIES WERE SUNNY WITH DESERT TEMPERATURES GENERALLY IN THE LOWER 80S AS OF 19Z.  12Z DETERMINISTIC MODELS AS WELL AS PROBABILISTIC GUIDANCE ARE IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT 7 DAYS...WITH LITTLE SPREAD NOTED IN THE MODELS UNTIL DAY 7 OR 8. THE AFOREMENTIONED UPPER LOW WEST OF CALIFORNIA WILL MOVE INLAND AND INTO ARIZONA ON MONDAY. PWATS AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM WILL NOT BE ANYWHERE NEAR AS MOIST AS WHAT WAS OBSERVED A FEW DAYS AGO...MODEL CONSENSUS SUGGESTS VALUES WILL ONLY APPROACH 0.5 TO 0.6 INCHES MONDAY AFTERNOON /WITHIN A FEW PERCENT OF NORMAL FOR MID MAY/. MOISTURE TRANSPORT AHEAD OF THIS TROUGH IS A BIT ANOMALOUS HOWEVER /APPROACHING THE 90TH PERCENTILE IN AREAS EAST OF PHOENIX/. NAEFS IS SUGGESTING A BROAD 10-20 PERCENT CHANCE OF RAINFALL MAINLY NORTH/EAST OF PHOENIX MONDAY AFTERNOON AND THIS SEEMS REASONABLE GIVEN UPSLOPE COMPONENT TO THE FLOW. THE DESERTS WILL BE HARD PRESSED TO SEE MUCH IN THE WAY OF RAINFALL...MORE THAN LIKELY LOOKING AT INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND A STRAY SPRINKLE OR LIGHT SHOWER BUT THAT`S ABOUT IT. LATEST HI-RES GUIDANCE IS ALSO MATCHES THIS LINE OF THINKING.  TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY WILL SEE WEAK RIDGING/BROAD SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW BUILD ACROSS THE AREA IN THE WAKE OF THE DEPARTING UPPER LOW. THIS WILL RESULT IN SLOWLY INCREASING TEMPERATURES ALTHOUGH HIGHS AT NO POINT DURING THIS PERIOD APPEAR TO CLIMB ABOVE NORMAL. LOOKS LIKE UPPER 80S/LOWER 90S ARE LIKELY FOR THE DESERTS THROUGH MID WEEK.  THE PARADE OF UPPER LOWS MOVING THROUGH THE AREA CONTINUES LATE IN THE WEEK...AS YET ANOTHER LOW IS FORECAST TO MOVE THROUGH CALIFORNIA INTO ARIZONA LATE THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY. MUCH LIKE THE MONDAY SYSTEM...THERE WILL BE SOME MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROUGH BUT AT LEAST AS OF NOW IT DOESN`T LOOK MUCH ABOVE WHAT WOULD NORMALLY OCCUR IN MID/LATE MAY. GIVEN THE MODEST ISENTROPIC LIFT SUGGESTED BY THE DETERMINISTIC GUIDANCE AND THE SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL MOISTURE TRANSPORT PER THE NAEFS...ELECTED TO GO WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATION AREAS OF THE FORECAST AREA. AT THIS POINT IT DOESN`T LOOK LIKE A MAJOR RAINFALL PRODUCER BUT IT SHOULD KNOCK TEMPERATURES BACK INTO THE LOW/MID 80S. EXPECT CONDITIONS TO DRY OUT AND TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB SLIGHTLY GOING INTO NEXT WEEKEND.  
SYNOPSIS...  UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE WILL BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS AND HIGH ELEVATION SNOW THROUGH MONDAY. COOL AND SHOWERY CONDITIONS WILL LIKELY CONTINUE THROUGH THE END OF NEXT WEEK AS A SERIES OF LOW PRESSURE AREAS AFFECT THE WEST. WEDNESDAY WILL HAVE THE BEST CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS, WITH PRECIPITATION CHANCES DECREASING BY THE MIDDLE OF THE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND.  SHORT TERM... VERY LITTLE CHANGE TO THE FORECAST REASONING THIS AFTERNOON FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. A SLOW MOVING UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL CONTINUE TO BRING UPPER DIVERGENCE TO THE REGION TONIGHT...EXTENDING THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WELL INTO THE EVENING WITH SHOWERS OVERNIGHT. JET FORCING IS WELL SOUTH OF THE REGION AND A LACK OF SFC HEATING IS LIMITING SFC BASED INSTABILITY. THE UPPER DIVERGENCE AND SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPS IN THE MID LEVELS WILL BE JUST ENOUGH TO TO KEEP ISOLATED THUNDER IN THE FORECAST. A FEW INCHES OF SLUSHY SNOW ARE POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS...ABOVE 8000 FEET...TONIGHT.  SIMILAR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED MONDAY AS THE UPPER LOW PRESSES EAST. WITH THE BETTER DIVERGENCE ALOFT DISPLACED A BIT TO THE EAST WOULD EXPECT THE BEST CHANCE FOR MEASURABLE RAIN AND HIGH ELEVATION SNOW WILL BE OVER THE WESTERN NEVADA BASIN AND RANGE AND SOUTHWEST INTO MONO COUNTY. LIKE TODAY...EARLY ONSET OF CONVECTION WILL LIMIT THE EXTEND OF SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY AND THERE IS LITTLE JET SUPPORT...SO THE COOLER TEMPS ALOFT AND UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE WILL BE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS FOR THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.  LESS FORCING EXISTS TUESDAY AS WE ARE BETWEEN UPPER LOWS. THIS DAY COULD BE THE WARMEST BECAUSE OF BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS...BUT THAT WILL ALSO PROMOTE SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY TO INCREASE. POPS WILL BE LESS TUESDAY...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO INCLUDE THUNDERSTORMS DUE TO THE INCREASED INSTABILITY.  BY WEDNESDAY ANOTHER LOW IS APPROACHING...AND THIS HAS MORE OF A NEGATIVELY TILTED TROUGH ASSOCIATED WITH IT AND WARMER TEMPS ALOFT. THERE IS A SLIGHTLY BETTER CHANCE THAT THE NOSE OF THE JET WILL AID DEVELOPMENT OVER THE SOUTHERN 1/3 OF THE FORECAST AREA...BUT AGAIN THE PRIMARY DRIVER WILL BE UPPER DIVERGENCE WHICH WILL INCREASE WITH THE NEGATIVELY TILTED TROUGH. WILL INCREASE POPS FOR WEDNESDAY AND MENTION A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS INSTEAD OF JUST SLIGHT CHANCE LIKE THE OTHER DAYS DUE TO THE INCREASED SURFACE INSTABILITY AND DIVERGENCE ALOFT.  WINDS SHOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE ANY DAY AND WITH INCREASED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IT DOES NOT APPEAR THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS. 20  LONG TERM...THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY... NO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE LONG TERM FORECAST. THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, AN UPPER LOW CENTERED NEAR POINT CONCEPTION WILL MOVE ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA AND INTO WESTERN ARIZONA. AS THE LOW MOVES BY NORTHEAST CALIFORNIA AND WESTERN NEVADA TO THE SOUTH, EASTERLY FLOW AROUND THE LOW WILL KEEP MOISTURE IN PLACE. THE MOISTURE WILL COMBINE WITH POSSIBLE SMALLER-SCALE DISTURBANCES AND DAYTIME HEATING TO BRING SCATTERED SHOWERS AS WELL AS THE CHANCE FOR AFTERNOON AND EVENING THUNDERSTORMS.  SATURDAY, THE UPPER LOW WILL MOVE OFF TO THE FOUR CORNERS AND ROCKIES. DISCREPANCIES BEGIN TO POP UP WITH RESIDUAL ENERGY ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE EXITING TROUGH, WITH THE GFS BRINGING ANOTHER WEAK IMPULSE INTO NORTHERN NEVADA WHILE THE ECMWF DOES NOT. WITH MOISTURE STILL NOT SCOURED OUT ON SATURDAY AND BETTER HEATING (LESS CLOUD COVER), IT WILL NOT TAKE MUCH FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON. WHILE THE GFS BRINGS THE MOST PROMISE FOR MORE CONVECTION, EVEN THE IMPULSE-LESS ECMWF INDICATES ISOLATED AFTERNOON/EVENING CONVECTION SO I HAVE LEFT POP AT A CHANCE FOR NOW.  SUNDAY, FLAT RIDGING RETURNS TO THE SIERRA AND WESTERN NEVADA. THIS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO DRY OUT AND STABILIZE THE ATMOSPHERE SUCH THAT AFTERNOON CONVECTION IS INHIBITED SO A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS REMAINS IN THE FORECAST. SNYDER  AVIATION... LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE OVER CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND ISOLATED EVENING THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE TONIGHT FOR EASTERN CALIFORNIA AND WESTERN/WEST-CENTRAL NEVADA. WIDESPREAD HIGHER TERRAIN OBSCURATION CAN BE EXPECTED IN THE SIERRA, WITH ISOLATED MOUNTAIN TOP OBSCURATION IN SHOWERS OUT INTO WESTERN NEVADA. THUNDERSTORMS THIS EVENING LOOK RELATIVELY WEAK BUT COULD PRODUCE SMALL (LESS THAN 0.5" DIAMETER) SOFT HAIL (GRAUPEL) AND WIND GUSTS TO AROUND 30 KTS.  MONDAY WILL FEATURE ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS AND SIMILAR STRENGTH (WEAK) AFTERNOON AND EVENING THUNDERSTORMS. SNYDER  
POINT REYES BROUGHT MID AND HIGH CLOUDS TO THE AREA TODAY ALONG WITH A FEW AFTERNOON CONVECTIVE SHOWERS. RADAR PICKED UP AN ISOLATED SHOWER IN THE LOS PADRES NATIONAL FOREST AND ONE EAST OF MT HAMILTON WHICH BOTH QUICKLY DISSIPATED. SHOWERS WERE MORE PERSISTENT OVER SOUTHEAST SAN BENITO COUNTY AND NORTHEAST NAPA COUNTY BUT THESE SHOWERS WILL DIMINISH SHORTLY AFTER DARK. MARINE LAYER IS DEEP SO STRATUS IS EXPECTED TO SPREAD WELL INLAND TONIGHT.  THE UPPER LOW WILL MOVE INLAND MONDAY WITH THE CENTER OVER THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE AIRMASS WILL BECOME MORE STABLE OVER OUR CWA WITH CONVECTION FOCUSED ON THE SIERRAS MONDAY BUT MODELS INDICATE A POSSIBILITY THAT SOME OF THE SHOWERS FROM THE SIERRAS COULD WRAP AROUND THE LOW INTO THE NORTH BAY MOUNTAINS LATE IN THE AFTERNOON.  DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AS THE LOW MOVES FURTHER EAST BUT NIGHT AND MORNING LOW CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE FROM ONSHORE FLOW BEHIND THE LOW. ANOTHER UPPER LOW IS FORECAST TO DROP SOUTHEAST INTO THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL WATERS ON THURSDAY. STILL UNCERTAIN WHETHER THIS LOW WILL TRACK INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR INTO OUR CWA BUT EITHER WAY THIS WILL RENEW A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN. THE LOW WILL MOVE INLAND ON FRIDAY AND WEAK RIDGING ALOFT WILL MOVE OVER THE AREA FOR THE WEEKEND.  TEMPERATURES WILL BE COOL AND BELOW NORMAL THROUGH THURSDAY THEN A WARMING TREND GOING INTO THE LONG WEEKEND.   
CLOUDS...MANAGING TO GET A FEW CONVECTIVE BUILDUPS OVER INTERIOR MOUNTAINS WHERE SUNSHINE IS MORE PREVALENT. HRRR MODEL CAPTURING THE CONVECTION OVER NORTHEAST SANTA CLARA COUNTY PRETTY WELL AND SHOULD PERSIST FOR A FEW MORE HOURS...THEN SHIFT EAST AND DECREASE THIS EVENING. MODEL ALSO SHOWS ACTIVITY FORMING OVER EASTERN SAN BENITO COUNTY AND PARTS OF MONTEREY COUNTY...BUT THICKER CLOUDS HAVE LIMITED CONVECTION. WOULD EXPECT SOME BUILDUPS AND POSSIBLY A SHOWER IN THIS AREA AS WELL LATER THIS AFTERNOON AS SOME BREAKS IN MID CLOUDS EXPECTED. OTHER AREA TO WATCH IS EXTREME NORTH BAY OVER ELEVATED TERRAIN...BUT NOT EXPECTING MORE THAN A FEW CUMULUS BUILDUPS.  WELL MIXED MARINE LAYER PERSISTS AND IS AT LEAST 3000 FEET DEEP THIS AFTERNOON NEAR THE COAST AND BAY AREA. TEMPERATURES MOSTLY IN THE 60S AND NOT MUCH CHANGE EXPECTED IN THE CURRENT COOL TEMPERATURE REGIME THROUGH AT LEAST THURSDAY. MARINE LAYER SHOULD REMAIN DEEP THROUGH THE WEEK AS WELL WITH A LINGERING TROF ALONG THE COAST. SERIES OF SHORT WAVES WILL REINFORCE THIS TROF THROUGHOUT THE WEEK WITH ONE WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE AREA MONDAY AND ANOTHER ONE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. STRONGEST FEATURE LOOKS TO ARRIVE THURSDAY AND PUSHES TOWARD SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.  MAIN IMPACT ON CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COAST WEATHER WILL BE PERSISTENT LOW CLOUDS ESPECIALLY NEAR THE COAST...COOL TEMPERATURES...AND MOSTLY DRY WEATHER. SHOWER THREAT SHOULD BE REDUCED MONDAY AND TUESDAY AS DYNAMICS AND MOISTURE SHIFT FURTHER INLAND. OUTSIDE CHANCE OF A SHOWER EACH AFTERNOON IN EXTREME NORTH BAY GIVEN INSTABILITY OVER TERRAIN. THURSDAY BRINGS A BETTER RISK FOR SHOWERS OVER INTERIOR AS THE STRONGEST WAVE IN THE SERIES BRINGS CYCLONIC CURVATURE AND SOME ADDED LIFT TO THE AREA.  RIDGE BUILDS INTO COAST OVER THE WEEKEND...SO DRYING AND WARMING TREND EXPECTED FROM FRIDAY INTO SUNDAY.  
THIS AFTERNOON. THIS FEATURE IS PROVIDING LIFT AND INSTABILITY TO PROMOTE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS OVER SOUTH FORK RIDGE WILL AND MOUNTAINS ACROSS EASTERN MENDOCINO COUNTY THIS AFTERNOON. AS OF 3PM APPROXIMATELY 25 C2G STRIKES HAVE BEEN RECORDED. THE CONVECTION IS FAIRLY LOW TOPPED(20K FT) AND BASES ARE LOW TO (5 KT FT) THUS SOME GOOD SHOWER ACTIVITY IS ACCOMPANYING THESE CELLS. STORMS SHOULD DISSIPATE LATER THIS EVENING HOWEVER SHOWER AND ISOLATED STORM CHANCES WILL LIKELY PERSIST AGAIN ON MONDAY AS THE UPPER LOW MEANDERS SOUTHWARD OVER CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. A BROAD LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ALOFT WILL REMAIN OVER THE REGION ON TUE. CONVECTIVE PARAMETERS WERE NOT LOOKING AS FAVORABLE FOR STORMS ON TUE. IT IS STILL 3 DAYS OUT AND A LOT WILL CHANGE BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. SO HAVE NOT MADE TOO MANY CHANGES HERE. WED THROUGH SAT...A BROAD AND COMPLEX LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ALOFT WILL CONTINUE TO BRING A THREAT OF SHOWERS AND PERHAPS ISOLATED T-STORMS TO MAINLY THE INTERIOR THROUGH THU. MORE STABLE CONDITIONS MAY DEVELOP FRI INTO SAT AS A RIDGE ALOFT BUILDS CLOSER TO THE COAST. THE MODELS HAVE NOT BEEN IN GREAT AGREEMENT HERE. THE GFS BUILDS A FLAT RIDGE OVER THE WEST COAST WHILE THE ECMWF HAS ANOTHER UPPER LOW DIVING SOUTHWARD. THE GEM WAS IN BETWEEN WITH BROAD CYCLONICALLY CURVED NORTH FLOW OVER THE AREA. CONSIDERING THE PERSISTENT LARGE SCALE TROUGH PATTERN AND THE DISCONGRUITY IN THE MODEL DATA...WILL MAINTAIN A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN THE INTERIOR FRI THROUGH SAT. JT/DB  
OF CALIFORNIA...WILL CONTINUE SHIFT EAST OVER CENTRAL CALIFORNIA...RESULTING IN BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND UNSETTLED WEATHER. SCATTERED SHOWERS WERE OBSERVED IN THE SIERRA NEVADA EARLY THIS AFTERNOON...WITH A FEW LOCATIONS IN TULARE COUNTY REPORTING RAINFALL RATES AROUND 0.05" PER HOUR. THIS SHOWER ACTIVITY OVER THE SIERRA CREST IS FORECAST TO INCREASE INTO THE EARLY EVENING HOURS AS THE HIGH RES ARW...NMM...AND HRRR ARE ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT ABOUT THIS INCREASE IN ACTIVITY. ADDITIONALLY...SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ARE ALSO POSSIBLE OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AS THE NAM...GFS...AND HIGH RES MODELS SHOW SURFACE CAPE VALUES EXCEEDING A FEW HUNDRED J/KG. THE NAM SEEMS TO BE THE OUTLIER WITH REGARDS TO CAPE VALUES...INDICATING OVER 1000 J/KG...WITH A BULLS EYE IN FRESNO COUNTY BETWEEN 2 PM AND 5 PM THIS AFTERNOON. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS CLOSELY AS THE AFTERNOON PROGRESSES.  LASTLY...SPINKLES WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AS LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS MOVE NORTHEAST INTO THE AREA FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.  BY MONDAY AFTERNOON THE UPPER TROUGH WILL SHIFT EAST INTO NEVADA...HOWEVER SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL REMAIN IN THE AREA. THE OPERATIONAL HIGH RES MODELS INDICATE SHOWERS OVER THE SIERRA CREST AGAIN MONDAY AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING HOURS AND ALSO THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER DAY OF SPRINKLES IN THE VALLEY. LASTLY...FEW SHOWERS WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE NEAR THE GRAPEVINE.  LITTLE CHANGE IN THE UPPER PATTERN THROUGH AT LEAST THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK AS A SERIES OF UPPER TROUGHS MOVES SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COAST. THIS PATTERN WILL RESULT IN DAYTIME HIGH TEMPERATURES REMAINING BELOW NORMAL THROUGH CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS AFTERNOON AND EVENING SIERRA NEVADA SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.  BY THE WEEKEND...UPPER LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD OVER THE REGION RESULTING IN A WARMING TREND ACROSS THE AREA.  
PREVIOUS FORECAST OTHER THAN INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER THROUGH TONIGHT...SO ADJUSTED GRID FORECAST ACCORDINGLY. TROF OFF THE WEST COAST EJECTING LARGE FIELD OF MID AND HIGH CLOUDS ACROSS THE AREA FOR NEXT 24 HOURS.  MORNING TEMPERATURES ARE MOSTLY IN THE 50S WITH SOME MID TO UPPER 40S IN INTERIOR VALLEYS AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS. MARINE LAYER IS DISORGANIZED AND WELL MIXED UNDER THICK MID AND HIGH CLOUDS AND UPPER TROF.  NOTED CHANGE FROM YESTERDAY IS THE FASTER MOVEMENT OF THE TROF TOWARD THE COAST. WOULD NOT RULE OUT A FEW SPRINKLES LATER TODAY PARTICULARLY OVER INTERIOR MOUNTAINS. VERY SLIGHT CHANCE OF A THUNDERSTORM IN EXTREME NORTHERN NAPA COUNTY LATE TODAY AS WELL...THOUGH CAPE SHOULD REMAIN UNDER 300J AND EXISTENCE OF ELEVATED WARM MOIST LAYER ABOVE 600 MB IS NOT CONDUCIVE FOR DEEPER CONVECTION. NOW STARTING TO LOOK LIKE LESS CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS INLAND SAN BENITO COUNTY MONDAY AS WELL WITH TROF DYNAMICS FURTHER INLAND TOWARD SIERRAS. WILL AWAIT ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE BEFORE MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO MONDAYS FORECAST.  
ACROSS OUR AREA WITH ALMOST ALL PLACES IN THE 50S. SATELLITE LOOP AND SURFACE OBS INDICATE A MIX OF CLEAR SPOTS AND CLOUDS ALTHOUGH THE LAST FEW FRAMES DO SHOW AN INCREASING PUSH FROM THE WEST. BY SUNRISE WIDESPREAD CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED ACROSS A WIDE PORTION OF OUR CWA. HIGHS WILL BE CLOSE TO WHAT WE SAW ON SATURDAY -- UPPER 50S TO MID 60S AT THE COAST WITH 60S FOR ALMOST ALL INLAND SPOTS.  SYNOPTICALLY...WE REMAIN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A BROAD LONGWAVE TROF. AS SYSTEM AFTER SYSTEM MOVES DOWN FROM THE NORTH IT IS PROVIDING A REINFORCING SHOT OF COOL AIR TO KEEP US COOLER THAN NORMAL. ALL INDICATIONS ARE FOR THE PATTERN TO REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH AT LEAST THURSDAY AND POSSIBLY FRIDAY. MODELS ALSO REMAIN IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT THAT ANY ASSOCIATED MOISTURE WILL GENERALLY STAY OUT OF OUR AREA. ONLY POTENTIAL EXCEPTIONS APPEAR TO BE THE FAR NORTH BAY PLUS FAR EASTERN MONTEREY COUNTY PLUS A PORTION OF SAN BENITO COUNTY. FOR THOSE SPOTS...POPS WERE LEFT 20 PERCENT OR LESS PLUS A MENTION OF THUNDER WAS CONTINUED DUE TO INSTABILITY.  WE WILL FINALLY SEE A BREAK EITHER ON FRIDAY OR SATURDAY AS A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE FIRST BUILDS TO THE COAST AND THEN PUSHES TO OUR AREA. THIS WILL HELP TO BRING HIGHS CLOSER TO NORMAL FOR ALL SPOTS.  BOTTOM LINE...GENERALLY QUIET FORECAST THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS WITH COOLER THAN NORMAL TEMPS AT LEAST INTO THURSDAY.  
See 18Z Aviation Discussion below.  


Satellite imagery and sfc obs show all terminals scattering out as cigs erode, w/VFR conditions expected everywhere by 21Z. Latest buffer soundings show a return of LIFR stratus at KMAF overnight, and perhaps KHOB, but all other terminals should remain VFR. Convection this afternoon looks to stay east of terminals.  
DISCUSSION...  Please see the 12Z aviation discussion below.  AVIATION...  Showers and thunderstorms over southeastern New Mexico will continue to move ENE through the morning, and could impact KHOB through the first hour of the forecast period. A second line of storms extending southward from roughly KBWS to KMAF could affect KMAF, especially if there`s any additional development behind the line or on the southern flank, thus have included a TEMPO from 12-14Z this morning for MVFR cigs and TSRA affecting the terminal. Otherwise, transient MVFR/IFR ceilings could affect area terminals this morning, though are expected to improve to VFR by around 15Z. VFR conditions will then prevail, with the caveat being the development of afternoon SHRA/TSRA, which is most likely to affect KINK, KMAF, and KFST. However, uncertainties regarding the timing of afternoon storms precludes mention in the current TAF, though heavy rain, hail, and strong winds are expected with storms that do develop.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 355 AM CDT Tue May 19 2015/  DISCUSSION... Upper pattern remains active with a train of upper lows continuing this week.  This morning an upper low was centered over the Intermountain West with SW flow reaching across the area.  The first low will move off to the east as another trough develops along the CA coast.  This will develop into a closed low before rolling east later in the week.  The result of this will be a continuation of the wet pattern for the area.  Evening storms with severe wx and flash flooding lingered into the early morning hours before moving east.  West TX Mesonet at Coyanosa reported 4.15 inches and St.Lawrence reported 1.54 inches... most of that falling in 1 hr.  An Areal Flood Warning will remain in effect all night due to the heavy rain near Coyanosa that resulted in several feet of water over the road.  A Flash Flood Watch remains in effect through midday generally along and north of the Pecos River.  Surface dewpts into the 60s... even as far west as CNM... and model soundings show PW over 1.3 inches indicate the potential for heavy rain will continue through the morning.  Most of the additional rain today should be northeast of Pecos county but since flooding is ongoing will add them to the FFA.  More storms expected today and have the potential for flash flooding and severe wx.  The best chance of rain today will be over the NE Permian Basin and carrying likely pops.  Most models seem to be in some agreement as to developing additional storms to the west of the area overnight and moving it across the region early in the day.  As of 08z have begun to get some new development across Eddy and Chavez counties.  Flooding will be the main concern through midday with severe wx in the afternoon.  Looking at the development of a dryline this afternoon which could become the focus for storm development. There is a slight risk of severe wx today mainly for the eastern half of the area.  Supercells will be possible during the afternoon with hail... wind... and a few tornadoes.  Models develop pops and qpf like crazy over the next several days... especially Thursday and Friday.  Temps will be in the 80s Tuesday and Wednesday before a cold front moves through late Wednesday. E/NE wind will keep it cooler on Thursday with highs in the 70s.  Warmer temps return to the 80s on Thursday and continue that way into early next week.  Lows in the 50s and 60s.  
NM...FLASH FLOOD WATCH until Noon MDT today FOR THE FOLLOWING ZONES...       Central Lea County...Eddy County Plains...Northern Lea      County...Southern Lea County.  TX...FLASH FLOOD WATCH until 1 PM CDT this afternoon FOR THE      FOLLOWING ZONES... Andrews...Borden...Crane...Dawson...      Ector...Gaines...Glasscock...Howard...Loving...Martin...      Midland...Mitchell...Pecos...Reagan...Reeves County and      Upper Trans Pecos...Scurry...Upton...Ward...Winkler.   
A SHORTWAVE WILL CONTINUE TRANSITING THE EASTERN TEXAS PANHANDLE AND WESTERN OKLAHOMA TODAY. LATEST MESOSCALE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THE BULK OF THE ASSOCIATED PRECIPITATION WILL REMAIN NORTHWEST OF OUR CWA...CLOSER TO A RETREATING SURFACE BOUNDARY. THIS WOULD APPEAR TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE FLOOD THREAT WITHIN THE FLASH FLOOD WATCH TODAY...PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF WHERE THE PRECIP-INDUCED MCV APPROACHING FROM SAN ANGELO IS NOW FAR LESS DEFINED. HOWEVER...THE LACK OF MORNING ACTIVITY WILL HELP TO SUFFICIENTLY DESTABILIZE THE ATMOSPHERE THIS AFTERNOON. THE SUNNY SKIES HEADING FOR THE SOUTHWESTERN ZONES WILL LIKELY FILL IN WITH DENSE CUMULUS...BUT EVEN WITH EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER...MLCAPE VALUES ARE ALREADY APPROACHING 2000J/KG. DEW POINTS WILL REMAIN NEAR 70F...WHICH COULD PUSH MLCAPE VALUES OVER 3000J/KG IN SOUTHERN ZONES. EVEN WITH NO SURFACE FOCUS FOR INITIATION...THIS INSTABILITY WILL BE UNCAPPED AND SHOULD RESULT IN DISORGANIZED CONVECTION...NOT UNLIKE MONDAY AFTERNOON. MINIMAL STORM MOTION WILL POSE A FLOODING THREAT...PARTICULARLY WHERE SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL HAS OCCURRED IN RECENT DAYS. IN ADDITION...PRECIP-LOADING IN A LOW-SHEAR ENVIRONMENT WILL RENEW A THREAT OF DAMAGING DOWNBURST WINDS. CELLS WILL BE MORE PROGRESSIVE IN NORTHWEST ZONES...BUT EXTRAORDINARY PW VALUES WILL ASSURE PRECIPITATION EFFICIENCY THAT COULD RESULT IN FLASH FLOODING.  MIDDAY UPDATE REDUCED POPS IN MANY AREAS...DUE TO THE LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN OVERALL COVERAGE AND STORM MOTION...BUT THE FLOOD THREAT REMAINS...EVEN IN AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE ONGOING FLASH FLOOD WATCH. POPS WERE RAISED IN SOUTHEAST ZONES WHERE INSTABILITY SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR 40- TO 50-PERCENT COVERAGE.  25  
/ISSUED 622 AM CDT TUE MAY 19 2015/ IFR CIGS HAVE DEVELOPED ACROSS ALL OF THE METROPLEX...AND WILL LIKELY REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH LATE MORNING. CONDITIONS REMAIN VFR IN THE WACO AREA...BUT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE SOME MVFR CIGS THIS MORNING AS THE LARGE SWATH OF PRECIPITATION MOVES IN FROM THE WEST. SPEAKING OF THE APPROACHING PRECIP...CLOUD TOPS HAVE WARMED RAPIDLY THIS MORNING AND WE EXPECT PRIMARILY SHOWERS AT ALL LOCATIONS DURING THE MORNING HOURS. WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON TRENDS TO SEE IF ANY APPRECIABLE AREA OF THUNDER DEVELOPS THIS MORNING...BUT AT THIS TIME WE WILL STICK WITH SHRA AT ALL TAF SITES.  MEANWHILE...A SHORTWAVE IS CURRENTLY ROTATING NORTHEAST OUT OF THE SOUTHERN ROCKIES INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FEATURE WILL INCREASE THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS NORTH TEXAS...WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO A ROUND OF SCATTERED CONVECTION ACROSS THE AREA. THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THE CURRENT AREA OF SHOWERS WILL DISSIPATE AROUND MIDDAY...WHICH SHOULD ALLOW ENOUGH TIME FOR THE ATMOSPHERE TO DESTABILIZE. IF PRECIP HOLDS ON LONGER THAN EXPECTED...THE CHANCES FOR CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON MAY BECOME HINDERED. FOR THIS REASON...WE WILL CONTINUE TO STICK WITH VCTS FOR THE AFTERNOON BUT HOLD OFF THE INCLUSION OF A TEMPO GROUP.  CONVECTION WILL WEAKEN AND MOVE OFF TO THE EAST THIS EVENING AS THE SHORTWAVE QUICKLY LIFTS INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS. SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF BORDERLINE IFR/MVFR CIGS OVERNIGHT.  30   
A COMPLEX OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUES TO PRODUCE HEAVY RAINFALL OVER THE CONCHO VALLEY AND BIG COUNTRY THIS MORNING. LATEST RADAR TRENDS INDICATE SOME MESO-SCALE CIRCULATION IN THE COMPLEX WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE TO SPAWN ADDITIONAL CONVECTION THROUGH THE MORNING. SOME OF THESE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD REACH THE WESTERN ZONES OF NORTH TEXAS THIS MORNING AND PRODUCE SOME HEAVY RAINFALL. THEREFORE...WE WILL ISSUE A FLASH FLOOD WATCH ALONG AND WEST OF A LINE FROM LAMPASAS TO WEATHERFORD TO BOWIE FOR TODAY. ADDITIONAL RAINFALL BETWEEN 1 AND 2 INCHES WITH SOME LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS ARE POSSIBLE.  WE EXPECT SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE ENTIRE REGION THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE BEST COVERAGE OF STORMS ACROSS THE NORTHWEST ZONES IN THE VICINITY OF A STALLED COLD FRONT. STORMS THAT DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE PRIMARILY HEAVY RAIN PRODUCERS BUT ALSO HAVE A POTENTIAL TO BECOME MARGINALLY SEVERE WITH HAIL AND DOWNBURST WINDS.  THE COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO LIFT TO NEAR THE RED RIVER TONIGHT IN RESPONSE TO ANOTHER DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IN THE WEST. THE FRONT SHOULD BECOME THE FOCUS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TONIGHT ESPECIALLY DURING THE EVENING WHEN A SHORTWAVE ROTATES ACROSS THE REGION. WE WILL NEED TO MONITOR THE MOVEMENT OF THE FRONT DURING THE DAY TODAY FOR A POSSIBLE EXTENSION/EXPANSION OF THE FLASH FLOOD WATCH.  THE SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE TO THE NORTHEAST OVERNIGHT TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING AND SHOULD BRING A BRIEF PERIOD OF LARGE SCALE SUBSIDENCE AND DECREASING PRECIPITATION CHANCES. HOWEVER...THIS WILL ONLY BE TEMPORARY AS LARGE SCALE LIFT INCREASE ACROSS THE REGION WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON/NIGHT IN RESPONSE TO AN APPROACHING UPPER LOW FROM THE WEST AND THE RETURN OF THE COLD FRONT.  THE COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO STALL OVER NORTH TEXAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. ALTHOUGH THE FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A SOURCE OF LIFT...SOME LARGE SCALE SUBSIDENCE UNDERNEATH A BUILDING UPPER LEVEL RIDGE SHOULD LIMIT CONVECTION SOMEWHAT.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY CHANCE TO LIKELY POPS THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY DUE TO NUMEROUS DISTURBANCES MOVING THROUGH SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. IT APPEARS THAT THE BEST POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE SUNDAY/SUNDAY NIGHT WHEN LARGE SCALE FORCING WILL BE THE STRONGEST.  79    
FLASH FLOOD WATCH UNTIL 7 PM CDT THIS EVENING FOR TXZ091-100>102- 115>117-129>132-141>143-156.   
MORNING. MAINLY UPDATED THE FORECAST BASED ON LATEST OBSERVATIONAL TRENDS. ISOLATED CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH SW TROUGH CONTINUES TO MOVE INTO THE WESTERN PART OF WEBB COUNTY. WILL KEEP POPS AROUND 20 PERCENT FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS...MAINLY ACROSS THE WESTERN AND NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE AREA. HIGH TEMPS ON TRACK WITH LOWER 90S OUT WEST WITH MID/UPPER 80S ELSEWHERE.  
DISCUSSION...UPDATED FOR THE 12Z AVIATION DISCUSSION.  ALSO...ADDED POPS TO LINGER INTO MID MORNING ACROSS THE WEST AS CONVECTION CONTINUES. SHOULD SEE DEVELOPMENT WANE THROUGH THE MID MORNING AS THE MAIN UPPER SHORTWAVE CONTINUES TO PUSH EAST.  WILL ALLOW THE HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS TO EXPIRE AT 7 AM. A MODERATE RISK WILL CONTINUE THROUGH TODAY AND TONIGHT.  AVIATION...ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOPING ALONG AND JUST WEST OF THE RIO GRANDE. WILL CONTINUE VCSH WITH TEMPO TSRA AT LRD THROUGH MID MORNING...EXPECTING THE CONVECTION TO WANE AS THE MAIN UPPER TROUGH SHIFTS FARTHER EAST. MVFR CIGS TO GRADUALLY IMPROVE THROUGH THE MORNING WITH VFR BY LATE MORNING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. BREEZY CONDITIONS WITH GUSTS UP TO 20 KNOTS WILL BE POSSIBLE TODAY. A RETURN OF MVFR CIGS WILL BE IN STORE FOR TONIGHT. ISOLATED CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON...HOWEVER THE BEST CHANCES WILL BE TOWARD THE VCT SITE WHERE BETTER CONVERGENCE RESIDES.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 452 AM CDT TUE MAY 19 2015/  SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...EARLIER STRONG CONVECTION WEST ACROSS MEXICO HAS WANED THROUGH THE NIGHT BUT A MIXTURE OF LIGHT RAIN AND SHOWERS WILL REMAIN POSSIBLE. HI-RES AND TX TECH WRF MODELS ARE HANDLING DEVELOPMENT WELL...BUT NOT SO MUCH AS COVERAGE...KEEPING THE RAIN THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING...ESPECIALLY FOR THE WESTERN ZONES...AS THE MAIN MIDLEVEL SHORTWAVE CONTINUES TO PROPAGATE EASTWARD. CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO DIMINISH AS SHOWERS MOVE FARTHER EAST INTO MORE STABLE CONDITIONS. THE EXCEPTION RESIDES ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES WHERE INCREASING INSTABILITY IS EXPECTED BY MID MORNING INTO THE AFTERNOON LEADING TO ISOLATED DEVELOPMENT. CONDITIONS TODAY WILL BE SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY AS BROAD RIDGING SUPPRESSING DEVELOPMENT DURING THE AFTERNOON. THAT IS NOT TO SAY CONVECTION IS NOT POSSIBLE...BUT COVERAGE WILL BE ISOLATED TO THE POINT WHERE MOST LOCATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN DRY. A REPEAT IS EXPECTED FOR THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR SEASONAL NORMAL ACROSS THE AREA...WITH ABOVE NORMAL OVERNIGHT LOWS DUE TO THE INFLUX OF SURFACE MOISTURE.  LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...ECMWF CONSISTENT IN SHOWING A COLD FRONT MOVING INTO CENTRAL TEXAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE FIELD ALONG THE FRONT WILL BE UNDERNEATH DIFLUENT FLOW ALOFT DOWNSTREAM FROM THE NEXT UPPER LOW TO MOVE INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. EXPECT MCS TO FORM OVER SOUTHWEST TEXAS AND MOVE SOUTH TOWARD THE RIO GRANDE PLAINS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO STALL JUST NORTH OF THE AREA THURSDAY. ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE SOME DRIER AIR OVER THE NORTHWEST GULF...GFS SHOWS PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WILL BE FROM 1.7-1.8 INCHES OVER THE REGION THURSDAY POOLING AHEAD OF THE FRONT. CONTINUE WITH 40-50 PERCENT CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY...MAY NEED TO GO HIGHER IF MCS STAYS ORGANIZED MOVING INTO THE AREA. A STRONG SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL BE MOVING OUT OF THE BIG BEND TOWARD THE HILL COUNTRY THAT WILL KEEP A GOOD CHANCE OF RAIN OVER THE BRUSH COUNTRY THURSDAY NIGHT. THE FRONT WASHES OUT BY FRIDAY AND REGION SHOULD BE UNDERNEATH A WEAK SHORT WAVE RIDGE. BUT ENOUGH MOISTURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE REGION TO KEEP 20-30 PERCENT POPS FRIDAY. THE UPPER LOW OVER CALIFORNIA FRIDAY MORNING WILL MOVE NORTHEAST THROUGH THE FOUR CORNERS REGION SATURDAY AND INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS SUNDAY. BUT SOUTHERN EXTENSION OF TROUGH DEEPENS INTO NORTHWESTERN MEXICO. THIS SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS THE BIG BEND/COAHUILA REGION SUNDAY. THIS SYSTEM WILL TAP INTO HIGHER MOISTURE...PWAT VALUES CLOSE TO 2 INCHES. THIS COULD LEAD TO ANOTHER ROUND OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL SUNDAY AND SHOWED POPS 50-60 PERCENT. KEPT CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST FOR MONDAY AS THE SHORT WAVE TROUGH MAY BE SLOW LIFTING OUT TO THE NORTHEAST.  
TX...NONE. GM...NONE.  
MORNING RADAR SHOWS TWO DIFFERENT SETS OF SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY OCCURRING OVER AND JUST WEST OF THE BRAZOS VALLEY. THE FIRST ROUND CONTINUES TO DRIFT NORTHEAST ACROSS THE BRAZOS VALLEY... AND THE SECOND A COMPLEX OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THAT/S DEVELOPED EAST OF BASTROP /SLOWLY DRIFTING NORTH/. MORNING SOUNDINGS FROM CORPUS CHRISTI... FORT WORTH... AND LAKE CHARLES ALL MEASURED PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES GREATER THAN 1.6 INCHES... BUT SOUNDING PROFILES THEMSELVES WERE NOT SATURATED IN THE MID LEVELS. SOMEWHAT DRIER MID-LEVEL AIR MAY HELP TO LIMIT RAINFALL INTENSITY A BIT BUT SLOW STORM MOTIONS TODAY /850-300 MB WINDS WSW AROUND 10 TO 15 KNOTS/ WILL CREATE A LOCALIZED FLOODING THREAT FOR ANY STORM THAT IS ABLE TO MAINTAIN ITSELF OVER AN AREA.  EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORM CHANCES TO CONTINUE ACROSS THE REGION TODAY AND THE 20-40 POPS CURRENTLY IN THE FORECAST HANDLE THIS WELL. MORNING SURFACE ANALYSIS /13Z/ SHOWED A WEAK AREA OF SURFACE CONVERGENCE /POSSIBLY REMNANTS OF OUTFLOW FROM YESTERDAY/ STRETCHED FROM NEAR AUSTIN TO COLUMBUS TO GALVESTON. HRRR/RAP CONTINUE TO SHOW DEVELOPMENT ALONG THIS FEATURE WITH INCREASING COVERAGE ACROSS THE REGION AS CONVECTIVE TEMPERATURES ARE REACHED. FORECAST SOUNDINGS DO SHOW A SHALLOW INVERTED-V SIGNATURE DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS AND CAN/T RULE OUT A GUSTY WIND THREAT /20 TO 40 MPH/ AS WELL WITH SOME OF THE STRONGER STORMS. OTHERWISE... REMAINDER OF FORECAST ON TRACK WITH MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO HOURLY TEMP/DEW POINT GRIDS BASED ON OBSERVATIONS WITH AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES RISING INTO THE MID 80S. UPDATED PRODUCTS ALREADY OUT.  HUFFMAN   
DISCUSSION... THIS RATHER ACTIVE WX PATTERN EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE UP- COMING FCST CYCLE. LOOKING FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF PCPN TODAY...THEN A BRIEF BREAK WEDS WITH MORE UNSETTLED WX FCST FOR THURS/FRI.  AS PER WV/RADAR LOOPS THIS MORNING...AN EMBEDDED SHORTWAVE IN THE PERSISTENT SW FLOW ALOFT LOOKS TO BE MOVING INTO SE TX LATER THIS MORNING/AFTN. LINGERING OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM STORMS LAST NIGHT ALONG WITH DAYTIME HEATING IN THE ALREADY UNSTABLE AIRMASS ACROSS THE REGION SHOULD ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRONG STORMS THIS AFTN. OF SOME CONCERN IS THE DIFFLUENT PATTERN AT THE UPPER PARTS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...EVEN IF IT IS NOT QUITE AS STRONGLY DIFFLUENT AS YESTERDAY. ANY SORT OF TRAINING COULD QUICKLY LEAD TO FLOODING PROBLEMS GIVEN THE VERY WET GROUNDS/LOW FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE. THE ISSUANCE OF A FLOOD WATCH FOR PARTS OF SE TX IS A POSSIBILITY.  SLIGHTLY WARMER MID LEVELS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN UPPER RIDGE SHOULD HELP TO LIMIT PCPN FOR WEDS...BUT RAIN CHANCES EXPECTED TO RETURN THUR AS THIS PATTERN HELPS TO PUSH A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY INTO OUR NRN ZONES. AS THE NEXT UPPER TROF DEEPENS NEAR THE CALI- FORNIA BAJA AND RE-ESTABLISHES THE SWLY WINDS ALOFT OVER THE AREA THURS...WE WILL SEE INCREASED TSRA CHANCES THROUGH FRI. LINGERING FRONT COMBINED WITH EMBEDDED DISTURBANCES BEING THE MAIN CULPRITS.  EXTENDED GUIDANCE INTO THE WEEKEND WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT WE WILL NEED SOME MENTION OF POPS AS THE ACTIVE SRN STREAM JET STAYS IN PLACE OVER THE STATE. 41  MARINE... LIGHTER WIND REGIME IN PLACE FOR A FEW DAYS. HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GULF WILL MAINTAIN THE ONSHORE FLOW. IN GENERAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE SHOULD DECREASE THROUGH WEDNESDAY. MAY HAVE TO WATCH FOR A SURGE OF MOISTURE MOVING THROUGH THE CENTRAL GULF AND INTO THE UPPER TX COASTAL WATERS THURSDAY WHICH MAY LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN COVERAGE OF SHOWERS. GRADIENT BEGINS TO TIGHTEN OVER THE WEEKEND AND SCEC CONDITIONS MAY BE POSSIBLE. 45  AVIATION... MESSY FORECAST FOR THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. MVFR TO IFR CIGS COVERING IAH TERMINALS NORTHWARD AND VFR TO MVFR FOR HOU SOUTHWARD AT 09Z. EXPECT THAT SOME SLIGHT NORTHWARD DRIFT OF LOWER THE CIGS COULD OCCUR FOR IAH AS REMNANT BOUNDARY WITH MORE EASTERLY WINDS DRAPED OVER THE REGION FROM 11R-ARM-HOU-BPT SLOWLY LIFTS NORTHWARD THIS MORNING. THEN MODEL SOUNDINGS (ASSUMING THEY ARE EVEN CLOSE TO REALITY) SHOW THE CAP ERODING WITH DAYTIME HEATING BY 16-17Z AND VCTS APPEARS TO BE IN ORDER. SOUNDINGS ALSO SHOW THE POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY DOWNPOURS AND RELATIVELY SLOW STORM MOTIONS...BY 21Z NAM SOUNDING DEPICTS SBCAPE OF 3400-3900J/KG/K-INDEX OF 30-33/WEAK SHEAR SO THINK THAT PULSE TYPE STORMS ARE LIKELY WITH PRIMARY IMPACTS GUSTY WINDS AND VISBY REDUCTIONS DUE TO HEAVY DOWNPOURS. NO TEMPOS FOR TSRA YET IN THE FORECAST AS DIFFERENTIAL HEATING/RETREATING BOUNDARY WILL PROBABLY BE THE MAIN DRIVERS. 45  
TX...NONE. GM...NONE. 
MORNING SHOWER ACTIVITY IS INCREASING OVER THE NORTHERN COUNTIES AS MOISTURE FEEDS INTO THE MCV IN THE FWD CWA. UPPED POPS A BIT IN THIS REGION TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS NEW ACTIVITY. OTHERWISE...NO MAJOR CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE FORECAST.  
DISCUSSION...12Z AVIATION BELOW.  AVIATION...BKN-OVC MVFR TO IFR CEILINGS WITH STRATUS THIS MORNING ACROSS SOUTH-CENTRAL TEXAS. REMNANTS OF OVERNIGHT CONVECTIVE COMPLEX IS PASSING NORTH OF THE CWA THIS MORNING. A FEW SHRA AND ISOLATED TSTMS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE MORNING ACROSS THE HILL COUNTRY AND CENTRAL TEXAS NEAR AUS...FEEDING INTO WHAT IS LEFT OF THE MCV FARTHER TO THE NORTH. OTHERWISE...CEILINGS SLOWLY RISING AFTER 16Z AND EVENTUALLY BECOMING VFR 18Z-20Z. MVFR CEILINGS RE-DEVELOPING 03Z-05Z AUS/SAT/SSF AND BECOMING IFR 06Z-08Z. MVFR CEILINGS RE-DEVELOP AT DRT 06Z-08Z.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 357 AM CDT TUE MAY 19 2015/  SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)... A SLOW MOVING MCS OVER WEST CENTRAL TX IS PRODUCING FLASH FLOODING OVER THE SAN ANGELO AREA EARLY THIS MORNING. IN THE PAST HOUR OR SO...THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE COMPLEX IS TAKING OVER AND SHOWING A MORE FORWARD PROPAGATING TREND. HI-RES MODEL SUGGESTED CORFIDI VECTORS SUGGEST THE STORMS TO REMAIN MOSTLY IN THE FORECAST AREAS TO THE NORTH...BUT AS NOTED IN THE LATEST SPENES AND FFGMPD DISCUSSIONS...DIFFLUENCE ALOFT IS CAUSING HI- RES SOLUTIONS TO SLOW DOWN THE MOTION WITH THE SYSTEM EXPECTED BECOME MORE DISORGANIZED AND SLOWER TOWARD DAYBREAK. UPSHEAR PROPAGATION VECTORS AND MODEL DEPICTIONS OF AN INCREASING MOISTURE TAP LATER IN THE MORNING WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER AT LEAST A MENTION OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL OVER THE NORTHERN HILL COUNTRY INTO THE NORTHERN PART OF AUSTIN METRO FOR TODAY. SHOULD THE HRRR CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE ROBUST STORM DEVELOPMENT FURTHER DOWN THE I-35 CORRIDOR...WE MAY CONSIDER A RAISE OF POPS AND EXPANSION OF THE HEAVY RAINFALL MENTION. OTHER HI-RES MODELS SHOW POOR AGREEMENT ON THESE SHORT-TERM TRENDS...SO WITH LOW CONFIDENCE WILL NOT EXPRESS A CONCERN OVER THE SATURATED SOILS OR THE NEED FOR A FFA AT THIS TIME.  ASIDE FROM THE ACTIVITY AFFECTING NORTHERN COUNTIES TODAY...OVERALL MODEL TRENDS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT FOR A RELATIVELY STABLE FORECAST FOR OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES TODAY INTO WEDNESDAY. FORECAST WEAK 700 MB RIDGING SHOULD LEAD TO EVEN LESS CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY FOR DAYTIME WEDNESDAY THAN TODAY.  LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)... THE RECOVERY TIME FOR SOUTH CENTRAL TX SOILS AND RIVERS IS SHORT AS MODEL CONSENSUS NOW SHOWS GOOD AGREEMENT ON A COLD FRONT FOCUS FOR MORE CONVECTION WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. THE MORE DISTINCT INDICATION OF THE FRONT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE FRONT COULD POSSIBLY REMOVE SOME OF THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND LEAD TO LIGHTER RAINFALL TOTALS INITIALLY. SOME BRIEF HEAVY DOWNPOURS AND A FEW STRONG STORMS COULD OCCUR WEDNESDAY EVENING GIVEN THE EVENING TIMING EXPECTED.  MODELS SHOW HIGHEST QPF CONCENTRATIONS SHIFTING TO WESTERN COUNTIES BY LATE THURSDAY WHERE ELEVATED MOISTURE POOLING IS PINNED AGAINST THE HIGHER TERRAIN TO THE WEST. THE WEAK MID-LEVEL RIDGING IS CLEARS OUT BY THEN...AND OVERRUNNING OF THE UNSTABLE MOIST AIR SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPREAD EAST ACROSS ALL AREAS THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY WITH MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF ELEVATED STORMS THAT TRANSITION INTO DEEPER CONVECTION BY FRIDAY. AT SOME POINT A FLASH FLOOD WATCH WILL PROBABLY BE ISSUED...POSSIBLY AS EARLY AS THURSDAY NIGHT. THE HEAVIEST RAINFALL CONCERN IS SAVED FOR MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND...AND WITH ALL MODELS SHOWING A GOOD PATTERN FOR A SLOW MOVING COMPLEX ENHANCED BY A HIGH AMPLITUDE UPPER TROUGH...WILL SHOW MOST OF THE ATTENTION FOR LATE SATURDAY THROUGH LATE SUNDAY.  
NONE. 
12Z TAFS...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE INCREASING IN COVERAGE ACROSS THE WESTERN/CENTRAL PANHANDLES AND SPREADING NORTHEAST. LIFR TO MVFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FOR MOST OF THE DAY...AND BY MID-AFTERNOON MOST CONVECTION SHOULD BE ACROSS THE EASTERN PANHANDLES. CONFIDENCE IS MEDIUM THAT THUNDERSTORMS COULD DEVELOP AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON OVER THE CENTRAL AND WESTERN PANHANDLES IF THEY CAN CLEAR OUT...AND HAVE ADDED PROB30 GROUPS FOR THE TAF SITES TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE PANHANDLES TONIGHT AND SHIFT WINDS OUT OF THE NORTH...AND HAVE MEDIUM CONFIDENCE IFR CEILINGS WILL DEVELOP OVERNIGHT.  ELSENHEIMER  
DISCUSSION... ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN TO PERSIST THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD AS PERIODIC UPPER TROUGHS WITHIN AN ACTIVE SOUTHERN STREAM CONTINUE TO IMPACT THE REGION.  SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO EXPAND IN COVERAGE ACROSS THE REGION EARLY THIS MORNING. A MOIST LOW-LEVEL AIRMASS REMAINS IN PLACE PER EASTERLY UPSLOPE FLOW IN WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT THAT MOVED THROUGH YESTERDAY. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF RECENT STRONG UPPER LOWS/TROUGHS CENTERED OVER THE GREAT BASIN REGION. INCREASINGLY DIFFLUENT FLOW AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE IS PROMOTING LARGE SCALE LIFT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN ROCKIES AND HIGH PLAINS...WITH A POTENT SHORTWAVE TROUGH EJECTING OUT OF THE LONGWAVE TROUGH PROVIDING MORE FOCUSED ASCENT ON THE MESOSCALE ACROSS EASTERN NM AND THE WESTERN PANHANDLES. A 40 KT SOUTHEASTERLY LOW-LEVEL JET HAS DEVELOPED OVERNIGHT IN RESPONSE TO HEIGHT FALLS AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM. RESULTANT LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION AND WARM AIR ADVECTION/ISENTROPIC LIFT ARE FURTHER AIDING CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. THUS FAR MUCAPES GENERALLY IN THE 500-1000 J/KG RANGE HAVE LIMITED OVERALL STORM INTENSITY...ALTHOUGH ONE INTENSE ELEVATED SUPERCELL DID MAKE IT INTO THE FAR SOUTHWEST TX PANHANDLE OUT OF EASTERN NM...LIKELY PRODUCING LARGE HAIL ALONG WITH VERY HEAVY RAIN.  EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND IN COVERAGE THIS MORNING AND MOVE NORTHEAST ACROSS THE PANHANDLES AS FORCING FOR ASCENT INCREASES WITH THE APPROACH OF THE AFOREMENTIONED SHORTWAVE AMIDST BROADER UPPER DIFFLUENCE. HEAVY RAINFALL WILL LIKELY BE THE PRIMARY CONCERN THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS AS PWATS CONTINUE TO INCREASE INTO THE 1 TO 1.5 INCH RANGE. A FEW EMBEDDED STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS WILL REMAIN POSSIBLE AS WELL...WITH LARGE HAIL THE MAIN SEVERE THREAT...ALONG WITH POSSIBLY SOME STRONG WINDS IF THEY MANAGE TO PENETRATE THE NEAR-SURFACE STABLE LAYER. DECIDED TO ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH FOR THE SOUTHEAST TX PANHANDLE TODAY. THIS PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA IN PARTICULAR HAS SEEN SEVERAL ROUNDS OF HEAVY RAIN RECENTLY...AND THIS IS WHERE THE HIGHEST PWATS ARE PROGGED TODAY...WHICH IS REFLECTED IN QPF OUTPUT FROM SEVERAL MODELS. AT LEAST LOCALIZED MINOR FLOODING WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA HOWEVER GIVEN SATURATED SOILS FROM THE RECENT RAINS AND THE MOIST AIRMASS IN PLACE TODAY...ALTHOUGH EXPECT THE PRECIP TO GENERALLY REMAIN PROGRESSIVE ENOUGH TO PRECLUDE WIDESPREAD SIGNIFICANT FLOODING PROBLEMS.  THIS INITIAL ROUND OF RAIN WILL TAPER OFF FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST THROUGH THE DAY. EXACTLY WHAT UNFOLDS THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON THIS MORNING CONVECTION...PARTICULARLY HOW MUCH CLEARING/INSOLATION WE SEE THIS AFTERNOON AND HOW PRONOUNCED OF A COLD POOL IS LEFT BEHIND BY THE MORNING CONVECTION. PLENTY OF MOISTURE WILL REMAIN IN PLACE THIS AFTERNOON...SO IF WE SEE SOME SUNSHINE AND THE LOW-LEVEL COLD POOL IS NOT OVERLY COOL/STABLE...MODERATE INSTABILITY MAY REDEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON. MODELS VARY IN THE DEGREE OF DESTABILIZATION THIS AFTERNOON...BUT SHOW THE POTENTIAL FOR AN AXIS OF MODERATE INSTABILITY TO EXTEND NORTHWEST ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST HALF OR TWO THIRDS OF THE TX PANHANDLE THIS AFTERNOON. IF THIS DOES INDEED MATERIALIZE IN WAKE OF THE MORNING CONVECTION...A DECENT SEVERE WEATHER THREAT WILL EXIST THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING IN A STRONGLY- SHEARED/VEERING ENVIRONMENT. A DRYLINE IS PROGGED TO SHARPEN NEAR THE NM STATE LINE THIS AFTERNOON...PROVIDING A POSSIBLE FOCUS FOR AFTERNOON CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT IF THIS DOES INDEED HAPPEN BEHIND THE MORNING CONVECTION. CERTAINLY WILL HAVE TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING SEVERE STORM POTENTIAL AS AN ISOLATED TORNADO THREAT WOULD BE PRESENT ALONG WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS IF ADEQUATE INSTABILITY DEVELOPS. OF COURSE THIS WILL HINGE STRONGLY ON HOW THE ATMOSPHERE RESPONDS TO THIS EARLY DAY CONVECTION...AND THUS CONFIDENCE IN HOW THINGS WILL ULTIMATELY UNFOLD REMAINS LOW AT THIS TIME.  A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTH THROUGH THE PANHANDLES TONIGHT...LEADING TO A LITTLE QUIETER WEATHER WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. LOW-LEVELS REMAIN MOIST IN WAKE OF THE FRONT...AND THUS COULD SEE SOME SHOWERS OR PERHAPS EVEN SOME LIGHT DRIZZLE DURING THIS TIME. CAN/T TOTALLY RULE OUT A FEW THUNDERSTORMS...BUT FORECAST SOUNDINGS STRONGLY SUGGEST THE ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN CAPPED TO ANY DEEPER CONVECTION.  THE NEXT CHANCE FOR WIDESPREAD RAIN AND STORMS ARRIVES THURSDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF THE NEXT UPPER TROUGH. THE POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAIN AND FLOODING WILL RETURN DURING THE THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY TIMEFRAME AS AMPLE MOISTURE AND LIFT AGAIN COME TOGETHER OVER THE AREA. ANY PRECIPITATION SUNDAY AND MONDAY LOOKS LESS ORGANIZED...BUT AT LEAST SOME THUNDERSTORM CHANCES WILL CONTINUE AS A PERTURBED UPPER FLOW PERSISTS.  KB  
TX...FLOOD WATCH THROUGH THIS EVENING FOR THE FOLLOWING ZONES:      COLLINGSWORTH...DONLEY...WHEELER.  OK...NONE.  
ALSO...ADDED POPS TO LINGER INTO MID MORNING ACROSS THE WEST AS CONVECTION CONTINUES. SHOULD SEE DEVELOPMENT WANE THROUGH THE MID MORNING AS THE MAIN UPPER SHORTWAVE CONTINUES TO PUSH EAST.  WILL ALLOW THE HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS TO EXPIRE AT 7 AM. A MODERATE RISK WILL CONTINUE THROUGH TODAY AND TONIGHT.  
JUST WEST OF THE RIO GRANDE. WILL CONTINUE VCSH WITH TEMPO TSRA AT LRD THROUGH MID MORNING...EXPECTING THE CONVECTION TO WANE AS THE MAIN UPPER TROUGH SHIFTS FARTHER EAST. MVFR CIGS TO GRADUALLY IMPROVE THROUGH THE MORNING WITH VFR BY LATE MORNING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. BREEZY CONDITIONS WITH GUSTS UP TO 20 KNOTS WILL BE POSSIBLE TODAY. A RETURN OF MVFR CIGS WILL BE IN STORE FOR TONIGHT. ISOLATED CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON...HOWEVER THE BEST CHANCES WILL BE TOWARD THE VCT SITE WHERE BETTER CONVERGENCE RESIDES.  
SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...EARLIER STRONG CONVECTION WEST ACROSS MEXICO HAS WANED THROUGH THE NIGHT BUT A MIXTURE OF LIGHT RAIN AND SHOWERS WILL REMAIN POSSIBLE. HI-RES AND TX TECH WRF MODELS ARE HANDLING DEVELOPMENT WELL...BUT NOT SO MUCH AS COVERAGE...KEEPING THE RAIN THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING...ESPECIALLY FOR THE WESTERN ZONES...AS THE MAIN MIDLEVEL SHORTWAVE CONTINUES TO PROPAGATE EASTWARD. CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO DIMINISH AS SHOWERS MOVE FARTHER EAST INTO MORE STABLE CONDITIONS. THE EXCEPTION RESIDES ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES WHERE INCREASING INSTABILITY IS EXPECTED BY MID MORNING INTO THE AFTERNOON LEADING TO ISOLATED DEVELOPMENT. CONDITIONS TODAY WILL BE SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY AS BROAD RIDGING SUPPRESSING DEVELOPMENT DURING THE AFTERNOON. THAT IS NOT TO SAY CONVECTION IS NOT POSSIBLE...BUT COVERAGE WILL BE ISOLATED TO THE POINT WHERE MOST LOCATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN DRY. A REPEAT IS EXPECTED FOR THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR SEASONAL NORMAL ACROSS THE AREA...WITH ABOVE NORMAL OVERNIGHT LOWS DUE TO THE INFLUX OF SURFACE MOISTURE.  LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...ECMWF CONSISTENT IN SHOWING A COLD FRONT MOVING INTO CENTRAL TEXAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE FIELD ALONG THE FRONT WILL BE UNDERNEATH DIFLUENT FLOW ALOFT DOWNSTREAM FROM THE NEXT UPPER LOW TO MOVE INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. EXPECT MCS TO FORM OVER SOUTHWEST TEXAS AND MOVE SOUTH TOWARD THE RIO GRANDE PLAINS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO STALL JUST NORTH OF THE AREA THURSDAY. ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE SOME DRIER AIR OVER THE NORTHWEST GULF...GFS SHOWS PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WILL BE FROM 1.7-1.8 INCHES OVER THE REGION THURSDAY POOLING AHEAD OF THE FRONT. CONTINUE WITH 40-50 PERCENT CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY...MAY NEED TO GO HIGHER IF MCS STAYS ORGANIZED MOVING INTO THE AREA. A STRONG SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL BE MOVING OUT OF THE BIG BEND TOWARD THE HILL COUNTRY THAT WILL KEEP A GOOD CHANCE OF RAIN OVER THE BRUSH COUNTRY THURSDAY NIGHT. THE FRONT WASHES OUT BY FRIDAY AND REGION SHOULD BE UNDERNEATH A WEAK SHORT WAVE RIDGE. BUT ENOUGH MOISTURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE REGION TO KEEP 20-30 PERCENT POPS FRIDAY. THE UPPER LOW OVER CALIFORNIA FRIDAY MORNING WILL MOVE NORTHEAST THROUGH THE FOUR CORNERS REGION SATURDAY AND INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS SUNDAY. BUT SOUTHERN EXTENSION OF TROUGH DEEPENS INTO NORTHWESTERN MEXICO. THIS SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS THE BIG BEND/COAHUILA REGION SUNDAY. THIS SYSTEM WILL TAP INTO HIGHER MOISTURE...PWAT VALUES CLOSE TO 2 INCHES. THIS COULD LEAD TO ANOTHER ROUND OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL SUNDAY AND SHOWED POPS 50-60 PERCENT. KEPT CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST FOR MONDAY AS THE SHORT WAVE TROUGH MAY BE SLOW LIFTING OUT TO THE NORTHEAST.  
TX...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK UNTIL 7 AM CDT THIS MORNING FOR THE      FOLLOWING ZONES: ARANSAS...CALHOUN...KLEBERG...NUECES.  GM...NONE.  

MORNING ACROSS SOUTH-CENTRAL TEXAS. REMNANTS OF OVERNIGHT CONVECTIVE COMPLEX IS PASSING NORTH OF THE CWA THIS MORNING. A FEW SHRA AND ISOLATED TSTMS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE MORNING ACROSS THE HILL COUNTRY AND CENTRAL TEXAS NEAR AUS...FEEDING INTO WHAT IS LEFT OF THE MCV FARTHER TO THE NORTH. OTHERWISE...CEILINGS SLOWLY RISING AFTER 16Z AND EVENTUALLY BECOMING VFR 18Z-20Z. MVFR CEILINGS RE-DEVELOPING 03Z-05Z AUS/SAT/SSF AND BECOMING IFR 06Z-08Z. MVFR CEILINGS RE-DEVELOP AT DRT 06Z-08Z.  
SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)... A SLOW MOVING MCS OVER WEST CENTRAL TX IS PRODUCING FLASH FLOODING OVER THE SAN ANGELO AREA EARLY THIS MORNING. IN THE PAST HOUR OR SO...THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE COMPLEX IS TAKING OVER AND SHOWING A MORE FORWARD PROPAGATING TREND. HI-RES MODEL SUGGESTED CORFIDI VECTORS SUGGEST THE STORMS TO REMAIN MOSTLY IN THE FORECAST AREAS TO THE NORTH...BUT AS NOTED IN THE LATEST SPENES AND FFGMPD DISCUSSIONS...DIFFLUENCE ALOFT IS CAUSING HI- RES SOLUTIONS TO SLOW DOWN THE MOTION WITH THE SYSTEM EXPECTED BECOME MORE DISORGANIZED AND SLOWER TOWARD DAYBREAK. UPSHEAR PROPAGATION VECTORS AND MODEL DEPICTIONS OF AN INCREASING MOISTURE TAP LATER IN THE MORNING WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER AT LEAST A MENTION OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL OVER THE NORTHERN HILL COUNTRY INTO THE NORTHERN PART OF AUSTIN METRO FOR TODAY. SHOULD THE HRRR CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE ROBUST STORM DEVELOPMENT FURTHER DOWN THE I-35 CORRIDOR...WE MAY CONSIDER A RAISE OF POPS AND EXPANSION OF THE HEAVY RAINFALL MENTION. OTHER HI-RES MODELS SHOW POOR AGREEMENT ON THESE SHORT-TERM TRENDS...SO WITH LOW CONFIDENCE WILL NOT EXPRESS A CONCERN OVER THE SATURATED SOILS OR THE NEED FOR A FFA AT THIS TIME.  ASIDE FROM THE ACTIVITY AFFECTING NORTHERN COUNTIES TODAY...OVERALL MODEL TRENDS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT FOR A RELATIVELY STABLE FORECAST FOR OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES TODAY INTO WEDNESDAY. FORECAST WEAK 700 MB RIDGING SHOULD LEAD TO EVEN LESS CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY FOR DAYTIME WEDNESDAY THAN TODAY.  LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)... THE RECOVERY TIME FOR SOUTH CENTRAL TX SOILS AND RIVERS IS SHORT AS MODEL CONSENSUS NOW SHOWS GOOD AGREEMENT ON A COLD FRONT FOCUS FOR MORE CONVECTION WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. THE MORE DISTINCT INDICATION OF THE FRONT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE FRONT COULD POSSIBLY REMOVE SOME OF THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND LEAD TO LIGHTER RAINFALL TOTALS INITIALLY. SOME BRIEF HEAVY DOWNPOURS AND A FEW STRONG STORMS COULD OCCUR WEDNESDAY EVENING GIVEN THE EVENING TIMING EXPECTED.  MODELS SHOW HIGHEST QPF CONCENTRATIONS SHIFTING TO WESTERN COUNTIES BY LATE THURSDAY WHERE ELEVATED MOISTURE POOLING IS PINNED AGAINST THE HIGHER TERRAIN TO THE WEST. THE WEAK MID-LEVEL RIDGING IS CLEARS OUT BY THEN...AND OVERRUNNING OF THE UNSTABLE MOIST AIR SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPREAD EAST ACROSS ALL AREAS THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY WITH MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF ELEVATED STORMS THAT TRANSITION INTO DEEPER CONVECTION BY FRIDAY. AT SOME POINT A FLASH FLOOD WATCH WILL PROBABLY BE ISSUED...POSSIBLY AS EARLY AS THURSDAY NIGHT. THE HEAVIEST RAINFALL CONCERN IS SAVED FOR MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND...AND WITH ALL MODELS SHOWING A GOOD PATTERN FOR A SLOW MOVING COMPLEX ENHANCED BY A HIGH AMPLITUDE UPPER TROUGH...WILL SHOW MOST OF THE ATTENTION FOR LATE SATURDAY THROUGH LATE SUNDAY.  
NONE.  
/12Z TAFS/  Ceilings will degrade to MVFR at all terminals through the morning hours with TEMPO -TSRA at KABI through noon. VFR ceilings will return to all terminals after noon with MVFR ceilings returning to the southern terminals after midnight.   
SHORT TERM... (Today and Tonight)  
FLASH FLOOD WATCH through this evening FOR THE FOLLOWING ZONES: Brown...Callahan...Coke...Coleman...Concho...Fisher...Haskell... Irion...Jones...McCulloch...Nolan...Runnels...San Saba... Shackelford...Sterling...Taylor...Throckmorton...Tom Green.  
DISSIPATING AS IT APPROACHES THE INTERNATIONAL BORDER. DEBRI HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS ARE MOVING EAST ACROSS DEEP SOUTH TEXAS. THE INVERSION WILL MAINTAIN CEILINGS AROUND 12 TO 15 KFT ACROSS THE AREA BUT WILL BEGIN TO BREAK WITH DAYTIME HEATING AND WINDS MIX DOWN TO SURFACE. EXPECT MVFR TO BECOME VFR FOR TODAY. AS THE GRADIENT IS EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN DURING THE DAY...THE SOUTHEAST WINDS WILL INCREASE WITH GUSTY WINDS UP TO 25 KNOTS POSSIBLE. WINDS DECOUPLE LATE IN THE TONIGHT.  
SHORT TERM /NOW THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...CURRENT IR SATELLITE IMAGERY AND 500 MB HEIGHTS SHOW LOW PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE GREAT BASIN WITH A BROAD DIVERGENT FLOW SPREAD FROM NM TO S CENTRALTEXAS. CURRENT WSR-88D SCAN SHOW AN MCS ONGOING IN W CENTRAL TEXAS WITH A ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM HEADING TOWARDS LAREDO WITH THE MEAN FLOW. THIS CLUSTER OF CONVECTION IS WEAKENING AS INSTABILITY DECREASES OVER THE NEXT HOUR NOT REACHING THE CWA OVERNIGHT. DEBRIS CLOUD FROM THE ACTIVITY TOWARDS THE NW WILL STREAM EAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN RANCHLANDS AND THE RGV KEEPING CEILINGS AROUND 1200 TO 1500 FT NEAR THE BASE OF THE INVERSION WHILE BKN TO OVERCAST ABOVE 4000 FT. THE CLOUD COVER WITH THE SOUTHEASTERLY SFC FLOW FEEDING MOISTURE INTO THE AREA WITH SFC DEWPOINTS IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S WILL MAINTAIN A SULTRY AND HUMID CONDITIONS THROUGH EARLY MORNING HOURS. DUE TO INVERSION AROUND 1500 FEET...HAZE FROM AGRICULTURAL BURNING OVER CENTRAL AMERICA AND MEXICO WILL LOWER VISIBILITIES AROUND 5 TO 7 MILES. CONDITIONS WILL IMPROVE SLIGHTLY DURING THE DAY WITH DAYTIME HEATING.  TODAY...MID LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS AS IT MOVES EASTWARD OVER THE AREA WHILE LOW PRESSURE TOWARDS THE WEST LIFTS NORTHEAST. LEE SIDE TROUGH ALONG AND EAST OF THE SIERRA MADRE WILL STRENGTHEN TIGHTENING PG ACROSS DEEP S TX. THIS WILL RESULT IN SE WINDS INCREASE ACROSS THE CWA WITH 15 TO 20 MPH AND GUSTS UP TO 25 MPH. DRIER AIR MASS IN THE LOWER LEVELS WITH PWATS RANGING BETWEEN 1.80 TO 1.70 INCHES WILL LIMIT THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS TODAY. CLOUD COVER WILL BREAK PROVIDING A MIX OF SUN AND CU CLOUDS TODAY. A MORE SOUTHERLY FLOW DURING THE DAY AT 850 MB WILL WARM UP TEMPERATURES INTO THE MID 90S THIS AFTERNOON. LEAN A DEG OR TWO WARMER THAN GUIDANCE.  TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...WHILE PERTURBATIONS WITHIN THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW MOVE EAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL TEXAS...RIDGE REMAINS OVER THE CWA. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP OVER THE SIERRA MADRE BUT REMAIN EAST OF THE AREA. DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS SHOW A SLOT OF 10 TO 15 DEG SPREAD AT 850 MB WHERE THE DRY AIR SURGES NORTH INTO THE CWA LIMITING CONVECTION IN THE RGV. WITH INVERSION RETURNING OVERNIGHT...EXPECT CEILINGS AROUND 1500 TO 2000 FEET RETURNING KEEPING LOW TEMPS OVERNIGHT IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S ONCE AGAIN WITH A HUMID NIGHT. GRADIENT STRENGTHENS ONCE AGAIN BUT WILL NOT BE AS STRONG COMPARED TO TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL WARM UP INTO THE MID 90S WITH ABUNDANT SUNSHINE.  LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MEMORIAL DAY/...AS CLOSED 500 MB LOW PRESSURE TRANSITIONS FROM OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA TO THE FOUR CORNERS REGION AND EVENTUALLY THE DAKOTAS...500 MB HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER CENTRAL MEXICO AND EXTENDED OVER THE BRO CWFA WILL BECOME SUPPRESSED TOWARDS THE SOUTH AND WEAKENED. THIS SYNOPTIC PATTERN WILL PRODUCE A MID-LEVEL FLOW OVERHEAD THAT WILL BECOME MORE ORIENTED OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST...WITH SHORTWAVES RIDING WITHIN THIS FLOW. ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL LIKELY INITIATE OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF NEIGHBORING MEXICO 
Please see the 12Z aviation discussion below.  
Showers and thunderstorms over southeastern New Mexico will continue to move ENE through the morning, and could impact KHOB through the first hour of the forecast period. A second line of storms extending southward from roughly KBWS to KMAF could affect KMAF, especially if there`s any additional development behind the line or on the southern flank, thus have included a TEMPO from 12-14Z this morning for MVFR cigs and TSRA affecting the terminal. Otherwise, transient MVFR/IFR ceilings could affect area terminals this morning, though are expected to improve to VFR by around 15Z. VFR conditions will then prevail, with the caveat being the development of afternoon SHRA/TSRA, which is most likely to affect KINK, KMAF, and KFST. However, uncertainties regarding the timing of afternoon storms precludes mention in the current TAF, though heavy rain, hail, and strong winds are expected with storms that do develop.  
DISCUSSION... Upper pattern remains active with a train of upper lows continuing this week.  This morning an upper low was centered over the Intermountain West with SW flow reaching across the area.  The first low will move off to the east as another trough develops along the CA coast.  This will develop into a closed low before rolling east later in the week.  The result of this will be a continuation of the wet pattern for the area.  Evening storms with severe wx and flash flooding lingered into the early morning hours before moving east.  West TX Mesonet at Coyanosa reported 4.15 inches and St.Lawrence reported 1.54 inches... most of that falling in 1 hr.  An Areal Flood Warning will remain in effect all night due to the heavy rain near Coyanosa that resulted in several feet of water over the road.  A Flash Flood Watch remains in effect through midday generally along and north of the Pecos River.  Surface dewpts into the 60s... even as far west as CNM... and model soundings show PW over 1.3 inches indicate the potential for heavy rain will continue through the morning.  Most of the additional rain today should be northeast of Pecos county but since flooding is ongoing will add them to the FFA.  More storms expected today and have the potential for flash flooding and severe wx.  The best chance of rain today will be over the NE Permian Basin and carrying likely pops.  Most models seem to be in some agreement as to developing additional storms to the west of the area overnight and moving it across the region early in the day.  As of 08z have begun to get some new development across Eddy and Chavez counties.  Flooding will be the main concern through midday with severe wx in the afternoon.  Looking at the development of a dryline this afternoon which could become the focus for storm development. There is a slight risk of severe wx today mainly for the eastern half of the area.  Supercells will be possible during the afternoon with hail... wind... and a few tornadoes.  Models develop pops and qpf like crazy over the next several days... especially Thursday and Friday.  Temps will be in the 80s Tuesday and Wednesday before a cold front moves through late Wednesday. E/NE wind will keep it cooler on Thursday with highs in the 70s.  Warmer temps return to the 80s on Thursday and continue that way into early next week.  Lows in the 50s and 60s.  
IFR CIGS HAVE DEVELOPED ACROSS ALL OF THE METROPLEX...AND WILL LIKELY REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH LATE MORNING. CONDITIONS REMAIN VFR IN THE WACO AREA...BUT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE SOME MVFR CIGS THIS MORNING AS THE LARGE SWATH OF PRECIPITATION MOVES IN FROM THE WEST. SPEAKING OF THE APPROACHING PRECIP...CLOUD TOPS HAVE WARMED RAPIDLY THIS MORNING AND WE EXPECT PRIMARILY SHOWERS AT ALL LOCATIONS DURING THE MORNING HOURS. WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON TRENDS TO SEE IF ANY APPRECIABLE AREA OF THUNDER DEVELOPS THIS MORNING...BUT AT THIS TIME WE WILL STICK WITH SHRA AT ALL TAF SITES.  MEANWHILE...A SHORTWAVE IS CURRENTLY ROTATING NORTHEAST OUT OF THE SOUTHERN ROCKIES INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FEATURE WILL INCREASE THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS NORTH TEXAS...WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO A ROUND OF SCATTERED CONVECTION ACROSS THE AREA. THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THE CURRENT AREA OF SHOWERS WILL DISSIPATE AROUND MIDDAY...WHICH SHOULD ALLOW ENOUGH TIME FOR THE ATMOSPHERE TO DESTABILIZE. IF PRECIP HOLDS ON LONGER THAN EXPECTED...THE CHANCES FOR CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON MAY BECOME HINDERED. FOR THIS REASON...WE WILL CONTINUE TO STICK WITH VCTS FOR THE AFTERNOON BUT HOLD OFF THE INCLUSION OF A TEMPO GROUP.  CONVECTION WILL WEAKEN AND MOVE OFF TO THE EAST THIS EVENING AS THE SHORTWAVE QUICKLY LIFTS INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS. SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF BORDERLINE IFR/MVFR CIGS OVERNIGHT.  30  
A COMPLEX OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUES TO PRODUCE HEAVY RAINFALL OVER THE CONCHO VALLEY AND BIG COUNTRY THIS MORNING. LATEST RADAR TRENDS INDICATE SOME MESO-SCALE CIRCULATION IN THE COMPLEX WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE TO SPAWN ADDITIONAL CONVECTION THROUGH THE MORNING. SOME OF THESE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD REACH THE WESTERN ZONES OF NORTH TEXAS THIS MORNING AND PRODUCE SOME HEAVY RAINFALL. THEREFORE...WE WILL ISSUE A FLASH FLOOD WATCH ALONG AND WEST OF A LINE FROM LAMPASAS TO WEATHERFORD TO BOWIE FOR TODAY. ADDITIONAL RAINFALL BETWEEN 1 AND 2 INCHES WITH SOME LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS ARE POSSIBLE.  WE EXPECT SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE ENTIRE REGION THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE BEST COVERAGE OF STORMS ACROSS THE NORTHWEST ZONES IN THE VICINITY OF A STALLED COLD FRONT. STORMS THAT DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE PRIMARILY HEAVY RAIN PRODUCERS BUT ALSO HAVE A POTENTIAL TO BECOME MARGINALLY SEVERE WITH HAIL AND DOWNBURST WINDS.  THE COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO LIFT TO NEAR THE RED RIVER TONIGHT IN RESPONSE TO ANOTHER DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IN THE WEST. THE FRONT SHOULD BECOME THE FOCUS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TONIGHT ESPECIALLY DURING THE EVENING WHEN A SHORTWAVE ROTATES ACROSS THE REGION. WE WILL NEED TO MONITOR THE MOVEMENT OF THE FRONT DURING THE DAY TODAY FOR A POSSIBLE EXTENSION/EXPANSION OF THE FLASH FLOOD WATCH.  THE SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE TO THE NORTHEAST OVERNIGHT TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING AND SHOULD BRING A BRIEF PERIOD OF LARGE SCALE SUBSIDENCE AND DECREASING PRECIPITATION CHANCES. HOWEVER...THIS WILL ONLY BE TEMPORARY AS LARGE SCALE LIFT INCREASE ACROSS THE REGION WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON/NIGHT IN RESPONSE TO AN APPROACHING UPPER LOW FROM THE WEST AND THE RETURN OF THE COLD FRONT.  THE COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO STALL OVER NORTH TEXAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. ALTHOUGH THE FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A SOURCE OF LIFT...SOME LARGE SCALE SUBSIDENCE UNDERNEATH A BUILDING UPPER LEVEL RIDGE SHOULD LIMIT CONVECTION SOMEWHAT.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY CHANCE TO LIKELY POPS THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY DUE TO NUMEROUS DISTURBANCES MOVING THROUGH SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. IT APPEARS THAT THE BEST POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE SUNDAY/SUNDAY NIGHT WHEN LARGE SCALE FORCING WILL BE THE STRONGEST.  79  
FLASH FLOOD WATCH THROUGH THIS EVENING FOR TXZ091-100>102- 115>117-129>132-141>143-156.   
IFR CIGS HAVE MOVED INTO CDS OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS AND WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE EARLY AFTERNOON AS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAKE THEIR WAY TOWARDS THE TERMINAL. VFR CONDITIONS CURRENTLY PREVAIL AT LBB AND PVW BUT WILL SOON CHANGE AS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MOVE IN FROM THE WEST. THESE WILL BRING IFR CIGS TO BOTH TERMINALS. LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS ARE CURRENTLY OVER BOTH TERMINALS BUT WILL QUICKLY MOVE NORTHEAST. HEAVY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD ARRIVE AT PVW AND LBB BY 12Z AND MAY REDUCE VIS TO LESS THAN 5 MILES AND MAY PRODUCE GUSTY WINDS AND SMALL HAIL. CONDITIONS AT ALL TERMINALS ARE EXPECTED TO IMPROVE TO MVFR BY 20-21Z. ANOTHER ROUND OF THUNDERSTORMS...SOME POSSIBLY SEVERE...IS POSSIBLE LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. HOWEVER...CONFIDENCE IN THIS IS LOW AT THE MOMENT AND DOES NOT WARRANT MENTION IN THIS TAF CYCLE.  
UPDATE... FORECAST FOR THE DEVELOPING MCS IS ONGOING AS EXPECTED WITH A LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS PUSHING INTO OUR WESTERN COUNTIES. THESE WILL PUSH EAST AND NORTHEAST QUICKLY THROUGH THE MORNING. HIGH RAINFALL RATES AROUND 2 INCHES OR MORE AN HOUR HAVE BEEN OBSERVED THROUGHOUT THE MORNING. A SECOND ROUND OF STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE LATER THIS MORNING AS ANOTHER MCS IS DEVELOPING IN NM BEHIND THE PRIMARY MCS. WHILE FLOODING IS THE PRIMARY THREAT...SUB-SEVERE HAIL AND GUSTY WINDS WILL BE POSSIBLE. ALDRICH  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 310 AM CDT TUE MAY 19 2015/  SHORT TERM... THE MCV THAT FORMED OVER THE PERMIAN BASIN/BIG COUNTRY THREW A MONKEY WRENCH INTO THE EARLY MORNING FORECAST AS THE OUTFLOW TEMPORARILY STABILIZED THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH SHOWED UP WELL ON WV IMAGERY. THE BIG CONCERN WITH THIS SUBSIDENCE WAS THE EFFECT ON CONVECTION LATER ON THIS MORNING AS THE SHORTWAVE OVER CENTRAL NM MOVED CLOSER TO THE REGION. WV IMAGERY SINCE 06Z HAS SHOWN THE AREA OF SUBSIDENCE OVER OUR WESTERN ZONES ERODED AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING SHORTWAVE. SUBSIDENCE EROSION IS ALSO EVIDENT ON RADAR AS SMALL WEAK SHOWERS HAVE STARTED TO FORM OVER SE NM. THEY HAVE HAD A HARD TIME FORMING WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE ATMOSPHERE IS STILL SOMEWHAT STABLE. IF FULL DESTABILIZATION HAPPENS HERE IN THE NEXT HOUR OR SO WE COULD SEE CONVECTION FORMING ALONG THE STATE LINE AND DEVELOP INTO AN MCS. AS OF 08Z CONVECTION IS BEGINNING TO FORM SOUTH OF THE ONGOING CONVECTION IN EASTERN NM SHOWING SOUTHWARD DEVELOPMENT. WHILE THE SVR THREAT IS VERY LOW DUE TO VERY MOIST ATMOSPHERIC PROFILES HEAVY RAIN AND FLOODING IS A CONCERN ESPECIALLY WITH THE TIMING OF THE MCS BEING AROUND THE MORNING COMMUTE. FOR NOW WE WILL KEEP THE AREAL FLOOD WATCH IN PLACE AND SEE HOW THIS SYSTEM EVOLVES. WE WILL ADD TO THE FLOOD WATCH OUR 4 NORTHEASTERN COUNTIES AS SHOWER ACTIVITY HAS DEVELOPED ALONG A SURFACE BOUNDARY ACROSS THE NORTHERN ROLLING PLAINS. WHILE THE BOUNDARY IS MOVING NORTHWARD SOME TRAINING WILL BE POSSIBLE WHICH MAY CAUSE FLOODING ISSUES.  THE EXPECTED MCS IS EXPECTED TO MOVE INTO OUR EASTERN ZONES BY THE AFTERNOON WHICH MAY OPEN A WINDOW FOR SKIES TO CLEAR FROM WEST TO EAST TO ALLOW FOR SOME DAYTIME HEATING. IF ENOUGH HEATING CAN BE OBTAINED WE WILL BE LOOKING AT A SVR WX THREAT FOR THE LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING HOURS. THE MAIN THREATS WOULD BE LARGE HAIL...DAMAGING WINDS...AND HEAVY RAIN. THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY IN WHETHER OR NOT SKIES WILL CLEAR OUT LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE SURFACE TO WARM ENOUGH TO CONVECT. THE NAM CERTAINLY THINKS THIS WILL HAPPEN AND SHOWS A VERY NICE MCS DEVELOPING LATER TODAY. IT IS...HOWEVER...ALONE IN THIS SCENARIO. THE ONLY OTHER MODEL CLOSE TO THE NAM IS THE NSSL WRF WHICH KEEPS CONVECTION LIGHT WITH THE HEAVIEST CONVECTION OCCURRING ACROSS THE EASTERN ROLLING PLAINS AFTER SUNDOWN. FOR NOW WE WILL KEEP SVR MENTION OUT OF THE FORECAST AND WATCH TRENDS THROUGH THE DAY TO DETERMINE IF AN UPDATE IS NEEDED. ALDRICH  LONG TERM... SPLIT FLOW UA PATTERN STILL ON TRACK FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD AND AS SUCH...THE MAIN FOCUS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PERIODS OF MODERATE TO HEAVY RAINFALL WHICH WILL POSE A THREAT FOR LOCALIZED FLOODING.  THE UA LOW NOTED WEST OF THE FOUR-CORNERS REGION EARLY THIS MORNING IS THE DRIVING FORCING FOR THE MCS ACROSS THE PERMIAN BASIN /THAT HAS SLOWLY DRIFTED TOWARDS THE LOW ROLLING PLAINS/...AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL STORM DEVELOPMENT ACROSS ERN NM AND PORTIONS OF THE SOUTH PLAINS AND ROLLING PLAINS. THIS UA LOW IS PROGGED TO TRANSLATE TO THE CNTRL/NRN PLAINS TOMORROW DURING THE DAY GIVEN WAY TO FLEETING LARGE SCALE SUPPORT AND HENCE A LOWERED HEAVY RAIN THREAT AS THE PRECIP ACTIVITY GRADUALLY SHIFTS EAST TO ACROSS THE ROLLING PLAINS. SW FLOW ALOFT WILL BE REPLACED BY LOW-AMPLITUDE RIDGING WHICH USUALLY SPELLS DIMINISHING CHANCES FOR RAINFALL. HOWEVER...THIS MAY NOT BE THE CASE. ALTHOUGH SOUNDINGS DO INDICATE A BIT OF DRYING ALOFT...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL STILL BE WELL INTACT /PWATS OF 0.40- 1.30 INCHES WITH HIGHEST VALUES NOTED OFF THE CAPROCK/...IN ADDITION TO THE AFOREMENTIONED EXITING UA LOW THAT WILL BE SENDING DOWN A COLD FRONT DURING THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY /WHICH IS SLIGHTER QUICKER THEN PREVIOUS ITERATIONS/. FURTHERMORE...A DRYLINE LOCATED ACROSS THE SWRN ZONES COUPLED WITH THE IMPINGEMENT OF A COLD FRONT AND AN UPSLOPE SFC REGIME WARRANTS CONTINUED CHANCES OF RAINFALL THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. CHANCES OF RAINFALL WILL SPREAD BACK TO THE REMAINDER OF THE CWA BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT GIVEN THE RETREAT OF THE DRYLINE TO ERN NM AND THUS THE OVERSPREAD OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE.  THEREAFTER...A SERIES OF PACIFIC UA DISTURBANCES WILL PROMOTE SHARPENING SW FLOW ALOFT AND EJECT EMBEDDED IMPULSES/SHORTWAVE TROUGH TO NEAR/ACROSS THE REGION...THE FIRST OF WHICH WILL OCCUR THURSDAY EVENING-FRIDAY MORNING. WITH THE DRYLINE PROGGED TO REMAIN ACROSS ERN NM...A MOIST UPSLOPE SFC REGIME WILL PREVAIL. STORMS WILL INITIALIZE ACROSS THE PERMIAN BASIN AND ERN NM BEFORE DRIFTING ENE TO ACROSS THE FA DURING THE SAID TIME-FRAME. PWATS OF 1.00+ INCHES SUGGESTS A HEAVY RAINFALL THREAT. ALTHOUGH THE IMPULSE WILL HAVE EXITED THE REGION BY FRIDAY AFTN...THE DRYLINE WILL HAVE MADE A RETURN TO LOCALES ON THE CAPROCK DURING THE SAID TIME. IF THERE IS ADEQUATE DAYTIME DESTABILIZATION...THE DRYLINE COULD SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR CI...AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR STORMS TO BECOME SEVERE /HAIL AND GUSTY WINDS/ WITH HEAVY RAINFALL. SATURDAY AND SUNDAY APPEARS TO BE SIMILAR TO FRIDAY /DRYLINE ON THE CAPROCK BY THE AFTN/...THOUGH WITH AN ADDED BENEFIT OF ANOTHER ALBEIT BROAD POSITIVELY TILTED TROUGH THAT WILL BE PROGRESSING ACROSS THE SRN PLAINS AND AID IN INCREASING LARGE SCALE ASCENT. ONCE AGAIN...SEVERE STORMS AND HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE. BY MONDAY...THE DRYLINE WILL MAINTAIN ITS PRESENCE ON THE CAPROCK DURING THE AFTN...THOUGH THE UA LOW WILL HAVE EJECTED NE OF THE REGION AND UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT WILL HAVE DIMINISHED. NONETHELESS...IF THE CONVERGENCE ALONG THE DRYLINE IS ADEQUATE...STORMS /POSSIBLY STRONG TO SEVERE/ COULD FIRE ALONG IT.  ALL IN ALL...THE WEATHER PREDICTION CENTER HAS A SWATH OF 5-7 INCH RAINFALL TOTALS VALID FROM 00Z TODAY TO 00Z NEXT TUESDAY...ALIGNED FROM THE SWRN SOUTH PLAINS TO THE NRN ROLLING PLAINS...WITH SLIGHTLY LESSER AMOUNTS ELSEWHERE /1.50-4.00 INCHES/. THIS WILL SURELY MAKE FOR QUITE A WET MAY!  HIGH TEMPS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW SEASONAL NORMS...ESPECIALLY WITH THE ANTICIPATED CLOUD COVER AND RAINFALL /70S AND 80S/...WITH THURSDAY BEING THE COOLEST /50S AND 60S/ DUE TO CAA USHERED IN BY WEDNESDAY/S FROPA.  
FLOOD WATCH UNTIL 1 PM CDT THIS AFTERNOON FOR TXZ025-026-031>044.  
FORECAST FOR THE DEVELOPING MCS IS ONGOING AS EXPECTED WITH A LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS PUSHING INTO OUR WESTERN COUNTIES. THESE WILL PUSH EAST AND NORTHEAST QUICKLY THROUGH THE MORNING. HIGH RAINFALL RATES AROUND 2 INCHES OR MORE AN HOUR HAVE BEEN OBSERVED THROUGHOUT THE MORNING. A SECOND ROUND OF STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE LATER THIS MORNING AS ANOTHER MCS IS DEVELOPING IN NM BEHIND THE PRIMARY MCS. WHILE FLOODING IS THE PRIMARY THREAT...SUB-SEVERE HAIL AND GUSTY WINDS WILL BE POSSIBLE. ALDRICH  
SHORT TERM... THE MCV THAT FORMED OVER THE PERMIAN BASIN/BIG COUNTRY THREW A MONKEY WRENCH INTO THE EARLY MORNING FORECAST AS THE OUTFLOW TEMPORARILY STABILIZED THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH SHOWED UP WELL ON WV IMAGERY. THE BIG CONCERN WITH THIS SUBSIDENCE WAS THE EFFECT ON CONVECTION LATER ON THIS MORNING AS THE SHORTWAVE OVER CENTRAL NM MOVED CLOSER TO THE REGION. WV IMAGERY SINCE 06Z HAS SHOWN THE AREA OF SUBSIDENCE OVER OUR WESTERN ZONES ERODED AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING SHORTWAVE. SUBSIDENCE EROSION IS ALSO EVIDENT ON RADAR AS SMALL WEAK SHOWERS HAVE STARTED TO FORM OVER SE NM. THEY HAVE HAD A HARD TIME FORMING WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE ATMOSPHERE IS STILL SOMEWHAT STABLE. IF FULL DESTABILIZATION HAPPENS HERE IN THE NEXT HOUR OR SO WE COULD SEE CONVECTION FORMING ALONG THE STATE LINE AND DEVELOP INTO AN MCS. AS OF 08Z CONVECTION IS BEGINNING TO FORM SOUTH OF THE ONGOING CONVECTION IN EASTERN NM SHOWING SOUTHWARD DEVELOPMENT. WHILE THE SVR THREAT IS VERY LOW DUE TO VERY MOIST ATMOSPHERIC PROFILES HEAVY RAIN AND FLOODING IS A CONCERN ESPECIALLY WITH THE TIMING OF THE MCS BEING AROUND THE MORNING COMMUTE. FOR NOW WE WILL KEEP THE AREAL FLOOD WATCH IN PLACE AND SEE HOW THIS SYSTEM EVOLVES. WE WILL ADD TO THE FLOOD WATCH OUR 4 NORTHEASTERN COUNTIES AS SHOWER ACTIVITY HAS DEVELOPED ALONG A SURFACE BOUNDARY ACROSS THE NORTHERN ROLLING PLAINS. WHILE THE BOUNDARY IS MOVING NORTHWARD SOME TRAINING WILL BE POSSIBLE WHICH MAY CAUSE FLOODING ISSUES.  THE EXPECTED MCS IS EXPECTED TO MOVE INTO OUR EASTERN ZONES BY THE AFTERNOON WHICH MAY OPEN A WINDOW FOR SKIES TO CLEAR FROM WEST TO EAST TO ALLOW FOR SOME DAYTIME HEATING. IF ENOUGH HEATING CAN BE OBTAINED WE WILL BE LOOKING AT A SVR WX THREAT FOR THE LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING HOURS. THE MAIN THREATS WOULD BE LARGE HAIL...DAMAGING WINDS...AND HEAVY RAIN. THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY IN WHETHER OR NOT SKIES WILL CLEAR OUT LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE SURFACE TO WARM ENOUGH TO CONVECT. THE NAM CERTAINLY THINKS THIS WILL HAPPEN AND SHOWS A VERY NICE MCS DEVELOPING LATER TODAY. IT IS...HOWEVER...ALONE IN THIS SCENARIO. THE ONLY OTHER MODEL CLOSE TO THE NAM IS THE NSSL WRF WHICH KEEPS CONVECTION LIGHT WITH THE HEAVIEST CONVECTION OCCURRING ACROSS THE EASTERN ROLLING PLAINS AFTER SUNDOWN. FOR NOW WE WILL KEEP SVR MENTION OUT OF THE FORECAST AND WATCH TRENDS THROUGH THE DAY TO DETERMINE IF AN UPDATE IS NEEDED. ALDRICH  LONG TERM... SPLIT FLOW UA PATTERN STILL ON TRACK FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD AND AS SUCH...THE MAIN FOCUS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PERIODS OF MODERATE TO HEAVY RAINFALL WHICH WILL POSE A THREAT FOR LOCALIZED FLOODING.  THE UA LOW NOTED WEST OF THE FOUR-CORNERS REGION EARLY THIS MORNING IS THE DRIVING FORCING FOR THE MCS ACROSS THE PERMIAN BASIN /THAT HAS SLOWLY DRIFTED TOWARDS THE LOW ROLLING PLAINS/...AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL STORM DEVELOPMENT ACROSS ERN NM AND PORTIONS OF THE SOUTH PLAINS AND ROLLING PLAINS. THIS UA LOW IS PROGGED TO TRANSLATE TO THE CNTRL/NRN PLAINS TOMORROW DURING THE DAY GIVEN WAY TO FLEETING LARGE SCALE SUPPORT AND HENCE A LOWERED HEAVY RAIN THREAT AS THE PRECIP ACTIVITY GRADUALLY SHIFTS EAST TO ACROSS THE ROLLING PLAINS. SW FLOW ALOFT WILL BE REPLACED BY LOW-AMPLITUDE RIDGING WHICH USUALLY SPELLS DIMINISHING CHANCES FOR RAINFALL. HOWEVER...THIS MAY NOT BE THE CASE. ALTHOUGH SOUNDINGS DO INDICATE A BIT OF DRYING ALOFT...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL STILL BE WELL INTACT /PWATS OF 0.40- 1.30 INCHES WITH HIGHEST VALUES NOTED OFF THE CAPROCK/...IN ADDITION TO THE AFOREMENTIONED EXITING UA LOW THAT WILL BE SENDING DOWN A COLD FRONT DURING THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY /WHICH IS SLIGHTER QUICKER THEN PREVIOUS ITERATIONS/. FURTHERMORE...A DRYLINE LOCATED ACROSS THE SWRN ZONES COUPLED WITH THE IMPINGEMENT OF A COLD FRONT AND AN UPSLOPE SFC REGIME WARRANTS CONTINUED CHANCES OF RAINFALL THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. CHANCES OF RAINFALL WILL SPREAD BACK TO THE REMAINDER OF THE CWA BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT GIVEN THE RETREAT OF THE DRYLINE TO ERN NM AND THUS THE OVERSPREAD OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE.  THEREAFTER...A SERIES OF PACIFIC UA DISTURBANCES WILL PROMOTE SHARPENING SW FLOW ALOFT AND EJECT EMBEDDED IMPULSES/SHORTWAVE TROUGH TO NEAR/ACROSS THE REGION...THE FIRST OF WHICH WILL OCCUR THURSDAY EVENING-FRIDAY MORNING. WITH THE DRYLINE PROGGED TO REMAIN ACROSS ERN NM...A MOIST UPSLOPE SFC REGIME WILL PREVAIL. STORMS WILL INITIALIZE ACROSS THE PERMIAN BASIN AND ERN NM BEFORE DRIFTING ENE TO ACROSS THE FA DURING THE SAID TIME-FRAME. PWATS OF 1.00+ INCHES SUGGESTS A HEAVY RAINFALL THREAT. ALTHOUGH THE IMPULSE WILL HAVE EXITED THE REGION BY FRIDAY AFTN...THE DRYLINE WILL HAVE MADE A RETURN TO LOCALES ON THE CAPROCK DURING THE SAID TIME. IF THERE IS ADEQUATE DAYTIME DESTABILIZATION...THE DRYLINE COULD SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR CI...AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR STORMS TO BECOME SEVERE /HAIL AND GUSTY WINDS/ WITH HEAVY RAINFALL. SATURDAY AND SUNDAY APPEARS TO BE SIMILAR TO FRIDAY /DRYLINE ON THE CAPROCK BY THE AFTN/...THOUGH WITH AN ADDED BENEFIT OF ANOTHER ALBEIT BROAD POSITIVELY TILTED TROUGH THAT WILL BE PROGRESSING ACROSS THE SRN PLAINS AND AID IN INCREASING LARGE SCALE ASCENT. ONCE AGAIN...SEVERE STORMS AND HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE. BY MONDAY...THE DRYLINE WILL MAINTAIN ITS PRESENCE ON THE CAPROCK DURING THE AFTN...THOUGH THE UA LOW WILL HAVE EJECTED NE OF THE REGION AND UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT WILL HAVE DIMINISHED. NONETHELESS...IF THE CONVERGENCE ALONG THE DRYLINE IS ADEQUATE...STORMS /POSSIBLY STRONG TO SEVERE/ COULD FIRE ALONG IT.  ALL IN ALL...THE WEATHER PREDICTION CENTER HAS A SWATH OF 5-7 INCH RAINFALL TOTALS VALID FROM 00Z TODAY TO 00Z NEXT TUESDAY...ALIGNED FROM THE SWRN SOUTH PLAINS TO THE NRN ROLLING PLAINS...WITH SLIGHTLY LESSER AMOUNTS ELSEWHERE /1.50-4.00 INCHES/. THIS WILL SURELY MAKE FOR QUITE A WET MAY!  HIGH TEMPS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW SEASONAL NORMS...ESPECIALLY WITH THE ANTICIPATED CLOUD COVER AND RAINFALL /70S AND 80S/...WITH THURSDAY BEING THE COOLEST /50S AND 60S/ DUE TO CAA USHERED IN BY WEDNESDAY/S FROPA.  
THIS RATHER ACTIVE WX PATTERN EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE UP- COMING FCST CYCLE. LOOKING FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF PCPN TODAY...THEN A BRIEF BREAK WEDS WITH MORE UNSETTLED WX FCST FOR THURS/FRI.  AS PER WV/RADAR LOOPS THIS MORNING...AN EMBEDDED SHORTWAVE IN THE PERSISTENT SW FLOW ALOFT LOOKS TO BE MOVING INTO SE TX LATER THIS MORNING/AFTN. LINGERING OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM STORMS LAST NIGHT ALONG WITH DAYTIME HEATING IN THE ALREADY UNSTABLE AIRMASS ACROSS THE REGION SHOULD ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRONG STORMS THIS AFTN. OF SOME CONCERN IS THE DIFFLUENT PATTERN AT THE UPPER PARTS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...EVEN IF IT IS NOT QUITE AS STRONGLY DIFFLUENT AS YESTERDAY. ANY SORT OF TRAINING COULD QUICKLY LEAD TO FLOODING PROBLEMS GIVEN THE VERY WET GROUNDS/LOW FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE. THE ISSUANCE OF A FLOOD WATCH FOR PARTS OF SE TX IS A POSSIBILITY.  SLIGHTLY WARMER MID LEVELS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN UPPER RIDGE SHOULD HELP TO LIMIT PCPN FOR WEDS...BUT RAIN CHANCES EXPECTED TO RETURN THUR AS THIS PATTERN HELPS TO PUSH A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY INTO OUR NRN ZONES. AS THE NEXT UPPER TROF DEEPENS NEAR THE CALI- FORNIA BAJA AND RE-ESTABLISHES THE SWLY WINDS ALOFT OVER THE AREA THURS...WE WILL SEE INCREASED TSRA CHANCES THROUGH FRI. LINGERING FRONT COMBINED WITH EMBEDDED DISTURBANCES BEING THE MAIN CULPRITS.  EXTENDED GUIDANCE INTO THE WEEKEND WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT WE WILL NEED SOME MENTION OF POPS AS THE ACTIVE SRN STREAM JET STAYS IN PLACE OVER THE STATE. 41  
LIGHTER WIND REGIME IN PLACE FOR A FEW DAYS. HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GULF WILL MAINTAIN THE ONSHORE FLOW. IN GENERAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE SHOULD DECREASE THROUGH WEDNESDAY. MAY HAVE TO WATCH FOR A SURGE OF MOISTURE MOVING THROUGH THE CENTRAL GULF AND INTO THE UPPER TX COASTAL WATERS THURSDAY WHICH MAY LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN COVERAGE OF SHOWERS. GRADIENT BEGINS TO TIGHTEN OVER THE WEEKEND AND SCEC CONDITIONS MAY BE POSSIBLE. 45 
MESSY FORECAST FOR THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. MVFR TO IFR CIGS COVERING IAH TERMINALS NORTHWARD AND VFR TO MVFR FOR HOU SOUTHWARD AT 09Z. EXPECT THAT SOME SLIGHT NORTHWARD DRIFT OF LOWER THE CIGS COULD OCCUR FOR IAH AS REMNANT BOUNDARY WITH MORE EASTERLY WINDS DRAPED OVER THE REGION FROM 11R-ARM-HOU-BPT SLOWLY LIFTS NORTHWARD THIS MORNING. THEN MODEL SOUNDINGS (ASSUMING THEY ARE EVEN CLOSE TO REALITY) SHOW THE CAP ERODING WITH DAYTIME HEATING BY 16-17Z AND VCTS APPEARS TO BE IN ORDER. SOUNDINGS ALSO SHOW THE POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY DOWNPOURS AND RELATIVELY SLOW STORM MOTIONS...BY 21Z NAM SOUNDING DEPICTS SBCAPE OF 3400-3900J/KG/K-INDEX OF 30-33/WEAK SHEAR SO THINK THAT PULSE TYPE STORMS ARE LIKELY WITH PRIMARY IMPACTS GUSTY WINDS AND VISBY REDUCTIONS DUE TO HEAVY DOWNPOURS. NO TEMPOS FOR TSRA YET IN THE FORECAST AS DIFFERENTIAL HEATING/RETREATING BOUNDARY WILL PROBABLY BE THE MAIN DRIVERS. 45 
(Today and Tonight)  
(Wednesday through Monday)  The active weather pattern will continue through the end of this week and through the Memorial Day holiday weekend. Our area will remain in southwest flow aloft, with embedded shortwaves entering Texas and enhancing rainfall potential. Timing of the weaker shortwaves remains problematic. Weak cold front should sag south from the Big Country into our central counties Wednesday evening, and this will provide a focus for convective development. The 00Z models have the front stalling near a Mertzon-San Angelo- Brownwood line Wednesday night into Thursday. A stronger upper wave may enter the area Thursday night with the front lifting back north as a warm front Friday morning. High moisture content (precipitable water values at or above 1.5 inches across some of our area), unstable air and the aforementioned features will result in heavy rainfall and the possibility for flooding. This is something we will be monitoring closely.  For the Memorial Day holiday weekend, an upper low is progged to move from southern California Friday morning, to eastern Utah on Saturday morning. An upper trough trailing south from the low is progged to move slowly east toward Texas, then lift out across the state Sunday night. With stronger instability and stronger vertical shear progged to be in place, will have a greater severe weather potential, along with a continued possibility of locally heavy rainfall.  19  
ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN TO PERSIST THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD AS PERIODIC UPPER TROUGHS WITHIN AN ACTIVE SOUTHERN STREAM CONTINUE TO IMPACT THE REGION.  SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO EXPAND IN COVERAGE ACROSS THE REGION EARLY THIS MORNING. A MOIST LOW-LEVEL AIRMASS REMAINS IN PLACE PER EASTERLY UPSLOPE FLOW IN WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT THAT MOVED THROUGH YESTERDAY. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF RECENT STRONG UPPER LOWS/TROUGHS CENTERED OVER THE GREAT BASIN REGION. INCREASINGLY DIFFLUENT FLOW AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE IS PROMOTING LARGE SCALE LIFT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN ROCKIES AND HIGH PLAINS...WITH A POTENT SHORTWAVE TROUGH EJECTING OUT OF THE LONGWAVE TROUGH PROVIDING MORE FOCUSED ASCENT ON THE MESOSCALE ACROSS EASTERN NM AND THE WESTERN PANHANDLES. A 40 KT SOUTHEASTERLY LOW-LEVEL JET HAS DEVELOPED OVERNIGHT IN RESPONSE TO HEIGHT FALLS AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM. RESULTANT LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION AND WARM AIR ADVECTION/ISENTROPIC LIFT ARE FURTHER AIDING CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. THUS FAR MUCAPES GENERALLY IN THE 500-1000 J/KG RANGE HAVE LIMITED OVERALL STORM INTENSITY...ALTHOUGH ONE INTENSE ELEVATED SUPERCELL DID MAKE IT INTO THE FAR SOUTHWEST TX PANHANDLE OUT OF EASTERN NM...LIKELY PRODUCING LARGE HAIL ALONG WITH VERY HEAVY RAIN.  EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND IN COVERAGE THIS MORNING AND MOVE NORTHEAST ACROSS THE PANHANDLES AS FORCING FOR ASCENT INCREASES WITH THE APPROACH OF THE AFOREMENTIONED SHORTWAVE AMIDST BROADER UPPER DIFFLUENCE. HEAVY RAINFALL WILL LIKELY BE THE PRIMARY CONCERN THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS AS PWATS CONTINUE TO INCREASE INTO THE 1 TO 1.5 INCH RANGE. A FEW EMBEDDED STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS WILL REMAIN POSSIBLE AS WELL...WITH LARGE HAIL THE MAIN SEVERE THREAT...ALONG WITH POSSIBLY SOME STRONG WINDS IF THEY MANAGE TO PENETRATE THE NEAR-SURFACE STABLE LAYER. DECIDED TO ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH FOR THE SOUTHEAST TX PANHANDLE TODAY. THIS PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA IN PARTICULAR HAS SEEN SEVERAL ROUNDS OF HEAVY RAIN RECENTLY...AND THIS IS WHERE THE HIGHEST PWATS ARE PROGGED TODAY...WHICH IS REFLECTED IN QPF OUTPUT FROM SEVERAL MODELS. AT LEAST LOCALIZED MINOR FLOODING WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA HOWEVER GIVEN SATURATED SOILS FROM THE RECENT RAINS AND THE MOIST AIRMASS IN PLACE TODAY...ALTHOUGH EXPECT THE PRECIP TO GENERALLY REMAIN PROGRESSIVE ENOUGH TO PRECLUDE WIDESPREAD SIGNIFICANT FLOODING PROBLEMS.  THIS INITIAL ROUND OF RAIN WILL TAPER OFF FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST THROUGH THE DAY. EXACTLY WHAT UNFOLDS THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON THIS MORNING CONVECTION...PARTICULARLY HOW MUCH CLEARING/INSOLATION WE SEE THIS AFTERNOON AND HOW PRONOUNCED OF A COLD POOL IS LEFT BEHIND BY THE MORNING CONVECTION. PLENTY OF MOISTURE WILL REMAIN IN PLACE THIS AFTERNOON...SO IF WE SEE SOME SUNSHINE AND THE LOW-LEVEL COLD POOL IS NOT OVERLY COOL/STABLE...MODERATE INSTABILITY MAY REDEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON. MODELS VARY IN THE DEGREE OF DESTABILIZATION THIS AFTERNOON...BUT SHOW THE POTENTIAL FOR AN AXIS OF MODERATE INSTABILITY TO EXTEND NORTHWEST ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST HALF OR TWO THIRDS OF THE TX PANHANDLE THIS AFTERNOON. IF THIS DOES INDEED MATERIALIZE IN WAKE OF THE MORNING CONVECTION...A DECENT SEVERE WEATHER THREAT WILL EXIST THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING IN A STRONGLY- SHEARED/VEERING ENVIRONMENT. A DRYLINE IS PROGGED TO SHARPEN NEAR THE NM STATE LINE THIS AFTERNOON...PROVIDING A POSSIBLE FOCUS FOR AFTERNOON CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT IF THIS DOES INDEED HAPPEN BEHIND THE MORNING CONVECTION. CERTAINLY WILL HAVE TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING SEVERE STORM POTENTIAL AS AN ISOLATED TORNADO THREAT WOULD BE PRESENT ALONG WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS IF ADEQUATE INSTABILITY DEVELOPS. OF COURSE THIS WILL HINGE STRONGLY ON HOW THE ATMOSPHERE RESPONDS TO THIS EARLY DAY CONVECTION...AND THUS CONFIDENCE IN HOW THINGS WILL ULTIMATELY UNFOLD REMAINS LOW AT THIS TIME.  A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTH THROUGH THE PANHANDLES TONIGHT...LEADING TO A LITTLE QUIETER WEATHER WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. LOW-LEVELS REMAIN MOIST IN WAKE OF THE FRONT...AND THUS COULD SEE SOME SHOWERS OR PERHAPS EVEN SOME LIGHT DRIZZLE DURING THIS TIME. CAN/T TOTALLY RULE OUT A FEW THUNDERSTORMS...BUT FORECAST SOUNDINGS STRONGLY SUGGEST THE ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN CAPPED TO ANY DEEPER CONVECTION.  THE NEXT CHANCE FOR WIDESPREAD RAIN AND STORMS ARRIVES THURSDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF THE NEXT UPPER TROUGH. THE POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAIN AND FLOODING WILL RETURN DURING THE THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY TIMEFRAME AS AMPLE MOISTURE AND LIFT AGAIN COME TOGETHER OVER THE AREA. ANY PRECIPITATION SUNDAY AND MONDAY LOOKS LESS ORGANIZED...BUT AT LEAST SOME THUNDERSTORM CHANCES WILL CONTINUE AS A PERTURBED UPPER FLOW PERSISTS.  KB  
WEST ACROSS MEXICO HAS WANED THROUGH THE NIGHT BUT A MIXTURE OF LIGHT RAIN AND SHOWERS WILL REMAIN POSSIBLE. HI-RES AND TX TECH WRF MODELS ARE HANDLING DEVELOPMENT WELL...BUT NOT SO MUCH AS COVERAGE...KEEPING THE RAIN THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING...ESPECIALLY FOR THE WESTERN ZONES...AS THE MAIN MIDLEVEL SHORTWAVE CONTINUES TO PROPAGATE EASTWARD. CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO DIMINISH AS SHOWERS MOVE FARTHER EAST INTO MORE STABLE CONDITIONS. THE EXCEPTION RESIDES ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES WHERE INCREASING INSTABILITY IS EXPECTED BY MID MORNING INTO THE AFTERNOON LEADING TO ISOLATED DEVELOPMENT. CONDITIONS TODAY WILL BE SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY AS BROAD RIDGING SUPPRESSING DEVELOPMENT DURING THE AFTERNOON. THAT IS NOT TO SAY CONVECTION IS NOT POSSIBLE...BUT COVERAGE WILL BE ISOLATED TO THE POINT WHERE MOST LOCATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN DRY. A REPEAT IS EXPECTED FOR THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR SEASONAL NORMAL ACROSS THE AREA...WITH ABOVE NORMAL OVERNIGHT LOWS DUE TO THE INFLUX OF SURFACE MOISTURE.  
SHOWING A COLD FRONT MOVING INTO CENTRAL TEXAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE FIELD ALONG THE FRONT WILL BE UNDERNEATH DIFLUENT FLOW ALOFT DOWNSTREAM FROM THE NEXT UPPER LOW TO MOVE INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. EXPECT MCS TO FORM OVER SOUTHWEST TEXAS AND MOVE SOUTH TOWARD THE RIO GRANDE PLAINS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO STALL JUST NORTH OF THE AREA THURSDAY. ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE SOME DRIER AIR OVER THE NORTHWEST GULF...GFS SHOWS PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WILL BE FROM 1.7-1.8 INCHES OVER THE REGION THURSDAY POOLING AHEAD OF THE FRONT. CONTINUE WITH 40-50 PERCENT CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY...MAY NEED TO GO HIGHER IF MCS STAYS ORGANIZED MOVING INTO THE AREA. A STRONG SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL BE MOVING OUT OF THE BIG BEND TOWARD THE HILL COUNTRY THAT WILL KEEP A GOOD CHANCE OF RAIN OVER THE BRUSH COUNTRY THURSDAY NIGHT. THE FRONT WASHES OUT BY FRIDAY AND REGION SHOULD BE UNDERNEATH A WEAK SHORT WAVE RIDGE. BUT ENOUGH MOISTURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE REGION TO KEEP 20-30 PERCENT POPS FRIDAY. THE UPPER LOW OVER CALIFORNIA FRIDAY MORNING WILL MOVE NORTHEAST THROUGH THE FOUR CORNERS REGION SATURDAY AND INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS SUNDAY. BUT SOUTHERN EXTENSION OF TROUGH DEEPENS INTO NORTHWESTERN MEXICO. THIS SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS THE BIG BEND/COAHUILA REGION SUNDAY. THIS SYSTEM WILL TAP INTO HIGHER MOISTURE...PWAT VALUES CLOSE TO 2 INCHES. THIS COULD LEAD TO ANOTHER ROUND OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL SUNDAY AND SHOWED POPS 50-60 PERCENT. KEPT CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST FOR MONDAY AS THE SHORT WAVE TROUGH MAY BE SLOW LIFTING OUT TO THE NORTHEAST.  
IMAGERY AND 500 MB HEIGHTS SHOW LOW PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE GREAT BASIN WITH A BROAD DIVERGENT FLOW SPREAD FROM NM TO S CENTRALTEXAS. CURRENT WSR-88D SCAN SHOW AN MCS ONGOING IN W CENTRAL TEXAS WITH A ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM HEADING TOWARDS LAREDO WITH THE MEAN FLOW. THIS CLUSTER OF CONVECTION IS WEAKENING AS INSTABILITY DECREASES OVER THE NEXT HOUR NOT REACHING THE CWA OVERNIGHT. DEBRIS CLOUD FROM THE ACTIVITY TOWARDS THE NW WILL STREAM EAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN RANCHLANDS AND THE RGV KEEPING CEILINGS AROUND 1200 TO 1500 FT NEAR THE BASE OF THE INVERSION WHILE BKN TO OVERCAST ABOVE 4000 FT. THE CLOUD COVER WITH THE SOUTHEASTERLY SFC FLOW FEEDING MOISTURE INTO THE AREA WITH SFC DEWPOINTS IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S WILL MAINTAIN A SULTRY AND HUMID CONDITIONS THROUGH EARLY MORNING HOURS. DUE TO INVERSION AROUND 1500 FEET...HAZE FROM AGRICULTURAL BURNING OVER CENTRAL AMERICA AND MEXICO WILL LOWER VISIBILITIES AROUND 5 TO 7 MILES. CONDITIONS WILL IMPROVE SLIGHTLY DURING THE DAY WITH DAYTIME HEATING.  TODAY...MID LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS AS IT MOVES EASTWARD OVER THE AREA WHILE LOW PRESSURE TOWARDS THE WEST LIFTS NORTHEAST. LEE SIDE TROUGH ALONG AND EAST OF THE SIERRA MADRE WILL STRENGTHEN TIGHTENING PG ACROSS DEEP S TX. THIS WILL RESULT IN SE WINDS INCREASE ACROSS THE CWA WITH 15 TO 20 MPH AND GUSTS UP TO 25 MPH. DRIER AIR MASS IN THE LOWER LEVELS WITH PWATS RANGING BETWEEN 1.80 TO 1.70 INCHES WILL LIMIT THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS TODAY. CLOUD COVER WILL BREAK PROVIDING A MIX OF SUN AND CU CLOUDS TODAY. A MORE SOUTHERLY FLOW DURING THE DAY AT 850 MB WILL WARM UP TEMPERATURES INTO THE MID 90S THIS AFTERNOON. LEAN A DEG OR TWO WARMER THAN GUIDANCE.  TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...WHILE PERTURBATIONS WITHIN THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW MOVE EAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL TEXAS...RIDGE REMAINS OVER THE CWA. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP OVER THE SIERRA MADRE BUT REMAIN EAST OF THE AREA. DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS SHOW A SLOT OF 10 TO 15 DEG SPREAD AT 850 MB WHERE THE DRY AIR SURGES NORTH INTO THE CWA LIMITING CONVECTION IN THE RGV. WITH INVERSION RETURNING OVERNIGHT...EXPECT CEILINGS AROUND 1500 TO 2000 FEET RETURNING KEEPING LOW TEMPS OVERNIGHT IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S ONCE AGAIN WITH A HUMID NIGHT. GRADIENT STRENGTHENS ONCE AGAIN BUT WILL NOT BE AS STRONG COMPARED TO TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL WARM UP INTO THE MID 90S WITH ABUNDANT SUNSHINE.  
SOUTH TEXAS AND THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY. TOO EARLY TO KNOW IF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WILL OCCUR...HOWEVER...STORM PREDICTION CENTER HAS PLACED NEARLY THE ENTIRE BRO CWFA IN A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE WEATHER IN THE DAY 3 SEVERE THUNDERSTORM OUTLOOK...WITH ISOLATED SEVERE HAIL/WIND AS THE MAIN HAZARDS. 
ACROSS THE GULF COAST WHILE LOW PRESSURE STRENGTHENS INTERACTS WITH BROAD HIGH PRESSURE DOMINATING THE GULF OF MEXICO. THIS WILL RESULT IN SOUTHEAST WINDS INCREASING AROUND 15 TO 18 KNOTS. SOME GUSTS COULD BE CLOSE TO 20 KNOTS. EXPECT SEAS TO BUILD CLOSE TO 6 FEET OFFSHORE AND 4 TO 5 FEET NEARSHORE THROUGH WEDNESDAY. POSSIBLE SCEC MAY BE POSTED FOR THE OFFSHORE WATERS. NO CHANCE OF SHOWERS IS EXPECTED WITH LOTS OF SUNSHINE AS DRY AIR MOVES INTO THE AREA PROVING GREAT BEACH WEATHER DAYS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF WINDS PICKING UP 15 TO 18 KNOTS.  WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MEMORIAL DAY...MODERATE WINDS AND SEAS WILL PREVAIL THROUGH A MAJORITY OF THE LONG TERM FORECAST PERIOD AS HIGH PRESSURE PREVAILS OVER THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO. WINDS AND SEAS MAY APPROACH SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CRITERIA SUNDAY AND MEMORIAL DAY AS THERMAL LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS OVER WESTERN TEXAS AND INTERACTS WITH THE HIGH. 

DRY AND WARM CONDITIONS WILL OCCUR OVER MOST OF THE AREA TODAY AS PART OF A SOUTHWEST TO WEST FLOW. BREEZY CONDITIONS WILL OCCUR THIS AFTERNOON WITH LOWER WIND SPEEDS EXPECTED TOMORROW. ANOTHER SURGE OF MOISTURE FROM THE EAST WILL OCCUR ON THURSDAY WITH SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE FOR AREAS EAST OF THE RIO GRANDE THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. DRY AND WINDY CONDITIONS WILL RETURN ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AS ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM PASSES NORTH OF THE LOCAL AREA. DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED THROUGH MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND WITH LOWER WIND SPEEDS POSSIBLE. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN NEAR SEASONAL AVERAGES THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND.  
A RETURN TO DRY CONDITIONS IS EXPECTED TODAY AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH LIFTS OUT OF THE AREA...TAKING MOST OF THE MOISTURE WITH IT. A DRY WEST TO SOUTHWEST FLOW PATTERN WILL OCCUR OVER THE LOCAL AREA WITH AFTERNOON BREEZES OF 15 TO 25 MPH FOR MOST LOCATIONS. WINDS WILL DIMINISH THIS EVENING AND WILL REMAIN LIGHT FOR MUCH OF WEDNESDAY DUE TO A RELAXED SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT. AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES WILL WARM TO NEAR NORMAL...WHICH IS MID TO UPPER 80S FOR THE DESERT LOWLANDS THIS TIME OF YEAR.  A LONG WAVE TROUGH IN THE EASTERN PACIFIC WILL CONTINUE TO SPAWN NEW WEATHER SYSTEMS THAT WILL MOVE EAST THROUGH THE INTER-MOUNTAIN WEST FOR THE REST OF THIS WEEK. THE NEXT OF THESE TROUGHS TO AFFECT THE AREA WILL BE ON THURSDAY. A SURGE OF MOISTURE WILL PUSH IN FROM THE EAST AT THE SAME TIME AS THE SYSTEM APPROACHES FROM THE WEST. THIS WILL RESULT IN SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR AREAS EAST OF THE RIO GRANDE THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. SOME OF THE STORMS MAY BECOME STRONG WITH HAIL AND STRONG WIND GUSTS. BEST CHANCE MEASURABLE RAINFALL WILL BE OVER HUDSPETH AND OTERO COUNTIES.  THIS SYSTEM WILL LIFT OUT TO THE NORTHEAST THURSDAY NIGHT WHICH WILL PULL THE MOISTURE BACK EAST OF THE AREA. A LARGER CLOSED LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE INLAND ON FRIDAY AND WILL MOVE INTO THE CENTRAL ROCKIES ON SATURDAY. SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO AND FAR WEST TEXAS WILL REMAIN ON THE DRY SIDE OF THE SYSTEM. STRONGER WINDS ALOFT ALONG THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE LOW WILL MIX WITH THE BOUNDARY LAYER TO GENERATE WINDY CONDITIONS FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AFTERNOON.  THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL COMPLETE ITS EXIT FROM THE AREA ON SUNDAY WITH GENERALLY LIGHTER WIND SPEEDS AND SLIGHTLY COOLER CONDITIONS EXPECTED ON SUNDAY. THE OUTLOOK FOR MEMORIAL DAY LOOKS SUMMER LIKE AND DRY WITH NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND LIGHT WIND WEST WINDS.  
DRY WEST TO SOUTHWEST FLOW PATTERN WILL MAINTAIN VFR CONDITIONS THROUGH THE VALID PERIOD. SKIES WILL BE SKC-SCT250. WINDS WILL BE GENERALLY WEST THROUGH MOST OF THE PERIOD. WIND SPEEDS WILL INCREASE TO 15 TO 20 KNOTS AFT 18Z...DIMINISHING TO 8 TO 13 KNOTS AFT 02Z.  
SYSTEMS MOVING INLAND FROM THE EASTERN PACIFIC WILL GENERALLY MAINTAIN A STEADY WEST TO SOUTHWEST FLOW OVER THE AREA FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. THE FIRST OF THE SYSTEMS WILL LIFT OUT OF THE STATE TODAY WITH DRY WEST TO SOUTHWEST WINDS THAT WILL BECOME BREEZY BY THE AFTERNOON. CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER THRESHOLDS WILL NOT BE MET THIS AFTERNOON. WIND SPEEDS WILL BE LOWER ON WEDNESDAY AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT RELAXES OVER THE REGION HOWEVER HUMIDITY VALUES WILL REMAIN LOW. ANOTHER ROUND OF THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR AREAS EAST OF THE RIO GRANDE ON THURSDAY AS ANOTHER PACIFIC SYSTEM APPROACHES FROM THE WEST AND MOISTURE SURGES IN FROM THE EAST. MOISTURE WILL RETREAT BACK TO THE EAST ON FRIDAY. DRY AND WINDY CONDITIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AS ANOTHER LARGE PACIFIC SYSTEM MOVES INLAND FROM THE WEST COAST. LOW HUMIDITY VALUES AND STRONGER WIND SPEEDS MAY ALLOW CONDITIONS TO REACH RED FLAG CRITERIA FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AFTERNOON.  
NM...NONE. TX...NONE. 
A SLOW MOVING MCS OVER WEST CENTRAL TX IS PRODUCING FLASH FLOODING OVER THE SAN ANGELO AREA EARLY THIS MORNING. IN THE PAST HOUR OR SO...THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE COMPLEX IS TAKING OVER AND SHOWING A MORE FORWARD PROPAGATING TREND. HI-RES MODEL SUGGESTED CORFIDI VECTORS SUGGEST THE STORMS TO REMAIN MOSTLY IN THE FORECAST AREAS TO THE NORTH...BUT AS NOTED IN THE LATEST SPENES AND FFGMPD DISCUSSIONS...DIFFLUENCE ALOFT IS CAUSING HI- RES SOLUTIONS TO SLOW DOWN THE MOTION WITH THE SYSTEM EXPECTED BECOME MORE DISORGANIZED AND SLOWER TOWARD DAYBREAK. UPSHEAR PROPAGATION VECTORS AND MODEL DEPICTIONS OF AN INCREASING MOISTURE TAP LATER IN THE MORNING WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER AT LEAST A MENTION OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL OVER THE NORTHERN HILL COUNTRY INTO THE NORTHERN PART OF AUSTIN METRO FOR TODAY. SHOULD THE HRRR CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE ROBUST STORM DEVELOPMENT FURTHER DOWN THE I-35 CORRIDOR...WE MAY CONSIDER A RAISE OF POPS AND EXPANSION OF THE HEAVY RAINFALL MENTION. OTHER HI-RES MODELS SHOW POOR AGREEMENT ON THESE SHORT-TERM TRENDS...SO WITH LOW CONFIDENCE WILL NOT EXPRESS A CONCERN OVER THE SATURATED SOILS OR THE NEED FOR A FFA AT THIS TIME.  ASIDE FROM THE ACTIVITY AFFECTING NORTHERN COUNTIES TODAY...OVERALL MODEL TRENDS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT FOR A RELATIVELY STABLE FORECAST FOR OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES TODAY INTO WEDNESDAY. FORECAST WEAK 700 MB RIDGING SHOULD LEAD TO EVEN LESS CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY FOR DAYTIME WEDNESDAY THAN TODAY.  
THE RECOVERY TIME FOR SOUTH CENTRAL TX SOILS AND RIVERS IS SHORT AS MODEL CONSENSUS NOW SHOWS GOOD AGREEMENT ON A COLD FRONT FOCUS FOR MORE CONVECTION WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. THE MORE DISTINCT INDICATION OF THE FRONT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE FRONT COULD POSSIBLY REMOVE SOME OF THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND LEAD TO LIGHTER RAINFALL TOTALS INITIALLY. SOME BRIEF HEAVY DOWNPOURS AND A FEW STRONG STORMS COULD OCCUR WEDNESDAY EVENING GIVEN THE EVENING TIMING EXPECTED.  MODELS SHOW HIGHEST QPF CONCENTRATIONS SHIFTING TO WESTERN COUNTIES BY LATE THURSDAY WHERE ELEVATED MOISTURE POOLING IS PINNED AGAINST THE HIGHER TERRAIN TO THE WEST. THE WEAK MID-LEVEL RIDGING IS CLEARS OUT BY THEN...AND OVERRUNNING OF THE UNSTABLE MOIST AIR SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPREAD EAST ACROSS ALL AREAS THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY WITH MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF ELEVATED STORMS THAT TRANSITION INTO DEEPER CONVECTION BY FRIDAY. AT SOME POINT A FLASH FLOOD WATCH WILL PROBABLY BE ISSUED...POSSIBLY AS EARLY AS THURSDAY NIGHT. THE HEAVIEST RAINFALL CONCERN IS SAVED FOR MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND...AND WITH ALL MODELS SHOWING A GOOD PATTERN FOR A SLOW MOVING COMPLEX ENHANCED BY A HIGH AMPLITUDE UPPER TROUGH...WILL SHOW MOST OF THE ATTENTION FOR LATE SATURDAY THROUGH LATE SUNDAY.  
Upper pattern remains active with a train of upper lows continuing this week.  This morning an upper low was centered over the Intermountain West with SW flow reaching across the area.  The first low will move off to the east as another trough develops along the CA coast.  This will develop into a closed low before rolling east later in the week.  The result of this will be a continuation of the wet pattern for the area.  Evening storms with severe wx and flash flooding lingered into the early morning hours before moving east.  West TX Mesonet at Coyanosa reported 4.15 inches and St.Lawrence reported 1.54 inches... most of that falling in 1 hr.  An Areal Flood Warning will remain in effect all night due to the heavy rain near Coyanosa that resulted in several feet of water over the road.  A Flash Flood Watch remains in effect through midday generally along and north of the Pecos River.  Surface dewpts into the 60s... even as far west as CNM... and model soundings show PW over 1.3 inches indicate the potential for heavy rain will continue through the morning.  Most of the additional rain today should be northeast of Pecos county but since flooding is ongoing will add them to the FFA.  More storms expected today and have the potential for flash flooding and severe wx.  The best chance of rain today will be over the NE Permian Basin and carrying likely pops.  Most models seem to be in some agreement as to developing additional storms to the west of the area overnight and moving it across the region early in the day.  As of 08z have begun to get some new development across Eddy and Chavez counties.  Flooding will be the main concern through midday with severe wx in the afternoon.  Looking at the development of a dryline this afternoon which could become the focus for storm development. There is a slight risk of severe wx today mainly for the eastern half of the area.  Supercells will be possible during the afternoon with hail... wind... and a few tornadoes.  Models develop pops and qpf like crazy over the next several days... especially Thursday and Friday.  Temps will be in the 80s Tuesday and Wednesday before a cold front moves through late Wednesday. E/NE wind will keep it cooler on Thursday with highs in the 70s.  Warmer temps return to the 80s on Thursday and continue that way into early next week.  Lows in the 50s and 60s.  
/ISSUED 1210 AM CDT TUE MAY 19 2015/ MODELS COMING INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE CONVECTIVE FORECAST AND IT MAKES SENSE GIVEN THE RECENT TRENDS. BELIEVE WE WILL HAVE A BAND OF SHOWERS OR POSSIBLE STORMS MOVE THROUGH DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS FROM THE SOUTHWEST. WILL SHOW SHOWERS IN THE TAF FROM 11-15Z...BUT MAY NEED TO ADD THUNDER IF CONFIDENCE IN THIS WAVE OF ACTIVITY GROWS. A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS WILL DEVELOP DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS WITH LITTLE CIN. MODEL GUIDANCE SEEMS TO BE IN AGREEMENT IN A SHORTWAVE TROUGH PIVOTING THROUGH DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS WITH STRONGER FORCING SPREADING ACROSS THE REGION. HAVE INSERTED VCTS FROM 18-23Z WHICH IS THE MORE LIKELY WINDOW FOR AT LEAST SCATTERED CONVECTION. THE 4KM WRF IS SHOWING A SOLID LINE DURING THIS TIME.  MVFR CIGS WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION DURING THE NEXT FEW HOURS. CIGS MAY LOWER TO IFR AROUND DAYBREAK DUE TO MOIST EASTERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW. CIGS WILL LIFT DURING THE MORNING HOURS AND SHOULD BECOME VFR BY EARLY AFTERNOON. VFR WILL PREVAIL OUTSIDE OF ANY STORMS TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. OTHERWISE LIGHT SOUTHEAST WINDS WILL BECOME MORE SOUTHERLY AND INCREASE TO 10-15 KT TOMORROW.  TR.92   
THE MCV THAT FORMED OVER THE PERMIAN BASIN/BIG COUNTRY THREW A MONKEY WRENCH INTO THE EARLY MORNING FORECAST AS THE OUTFLOW TEMPORARILY STABILIZED THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH SHOWED UP WELL ON WV IMAGERY. THE BIG CONCERN WITH THIS SUBSIDENCE WAS THE EFFECT ON CONVECTION LATER ON THIS MORNING AS THE SHORTWAVE OVER CENTRAL NM MOVED CLOSER TO THE REGION. WV IMAGERY SINCE 06Z HAS SHOWN THE AREA OF SUBSIDENCE OVER OUR WESTERN ZONES ERODED AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING SHORTWAVE. SUBSIDENCE EROSION IS ALSO EVIDENT ON RADAR AS SMALL WEAK SHOWERS HAVE STARTED TO FORM OVER SE NM. THEY HAVE HAD A HARD TIME FORMING WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE ATMOSPHERE IS STILL SOMEWHAT STABLE. IF FULL DESTABILIZATION HAPPENS HERE IN THE NEXT HOUR OR SO WE COULD SEE CONVECTION FORMING ALONG THE STATE LINE AND DEVELOP INTO AN MCS. AS OF 08Z CONVECTION IS BEGINNING TO FORM SOUTH OF THE ONGOING CONVECTION IN EASTERN NM SHOWING SOUTHWARD DEVELOPMENT. WHILE THE SVR THREAT IS VERY LOW DUE TO VERY MOIST ATMOSPHERIC PROFILES HEAVY RAIN AND FLOODING IS A CONCERN ESPECIALLY WITH THE TIMING OF THE MCS BEING AROUND THE MORNING COMMUTE. FOR NOW WE WILL KEEP THE AREAL FLOOD WATCH IN PLACE AND SEE HOW THIS SYSTEM EVOLVES. WE WILL ADD TO THE FLOOD WATCH OUR 4 NORTHEASTERN COUNTIES AS SHOWER ACTIVITY HAS DEVELOPED ALONG A SURFACE BOUNDARY ACROSS THE NORTHERN ROLLING PLAINS. WHILE THE BOUNDARY IS MOVING NORTHWARD SOME TRAINING WILL BE POSSIBLE WHICH MAY CAUSE FLOODING ISSUES.  THE EXPECTED MCS IS EXPECTED TO MOVE INTO OUR EASTERN ZONES BY THE AFTERNOON WHICH MAY OPEN A WINDOW FOR SKIES TO CLEAR FROM WEST TO EAST TO ALLOW FOR SOME DAYTIME HEATING. IF ENOUGH HEATING CAN BE OBTAINED WE WILL BE LOOKING AT A SVR WX THREAT FOR THE LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING HOURS. THE MAIN THREATS WOULD BE LARGE HAIL...DAMAGING WINDS...AND HEAVY RAIN. THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY IN WHETHER OR NOT SKIES WILL CLEAR OUT LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE SURFACE TO WARM ENOUGH TO CONVECT. THE NAM CERTAINLY THINKS THIS WILL HAPPEN AND SHOWS A VERY NICE MCS DEVELOPING LATER TODAY. IT IS...HOWEVER...ALONE IN THIS SCENARIO. THE ONLY OTHER MODEL CLOSE TO THE NAM IS THE NSSL WRF WHICH KEEPS CONVECTION LIGHT WITH THE HEAVIEST CONVECTION OCCURRING ACROSS THE EASTERN ROLLING PLAINS AFTER SUNDOWN. FOR NOW WE WILL KEEP SVR MENTION OUT OF THE FORECAST AND WATCH TRENDS THROUGH THE DAY TO DETERMINE IF AN UPDATE IS NEEDED. ALDRICH  
DISSIPATING BUT DEBRI HIGH LEVELS CLOUDS ARE MOVING EAST ACROSS DEEP SOUTH TEXAS NOW. THE INVERSION HAS SET UP WHICH IS SHOWN IN THE LATEST SOUNDING AND WILL MAINTAIN CEILINGS AROUND 12 TO 15 KFT ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH THE NIGHT. THIS LOW LEVEL INVERSION WILL BREAK IN THE MORNING HOURS WITH DAYTIME HEATING HELPING MIX OUT THE LOW LAYER MOISTURE. EXPECT MVFR WITH BKN TO OVC TO BECOME MORE SCT TO BKN DURING THE DAY WITH VFR CONDITIONS. AS THE GRADIENT IS EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN DURING THE DAY...THE SOUTHEAST WINDS WILL INCREASE WITH GUSTY WINDS UP TO 25 KNOTS POSSIBLE. WINDS DECOUPLE LATE EVENING.  
DISCUSSION...UPDATED FOR LATEST AVIATION DISCUSSION BELOW.  AVIATION...MVFR CIGS ALREADY DEVELOPING NEAR KBRO AND ARE EXPECTED TO SPREAD NORTH AND WEST THROUGH THE EVENING. THE THREE TERMINALS SHOULD SEE BKN-OVC MVFR CIGS BETWEEN 15-25K FEET BETWEEN 3-6Z AND PERSIST UNTIL 12-14Z. LOW LEVEL INVERSION TO BREAK AND DAY TIME HEATING TO HELP MIX OUT THE LOW LAYER MOISTURE WITH SCT- BKN VFR CONDITOINS REDEVELOPING AFTER 14Z TUESDAY. LIGHT TO MODERATE SOUTHEAST WINDS THIS EVENING BECOME GUSTY TUESDAY WITH GUSTS AROUND 25 KNOTS.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 237 PM CDT MON MAY 18 2015/  SHORT TERM /NOW THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...A MODEST SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST H5 FLOW WILL LIE OVER MUCH OF TEXAS IN THE SHORT TERM... DOWNSTREAM OF MID LEVEL TROUGHING EDGING EAST FROM CALIFORNIA TOWARD THE GREAT BASIN AND FOUR CORNERS. WEAK H5 RIDGING WILL OCCUR OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE ANCHORED OVER THE NORTH AND WEST GULF. THE RESULT WILL BE A DRY FORECAST WITH WARM... SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES...THAT IS MID TO UPPER 70S AT NIGHT AND UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S DURING THE DAY. LIGHT TO MODERATE SOUTHEAST WINDS WILL CONTINUE...WITH A MIX OF CLOUDS AND SUN DURING THE DAY AND MARINE INVERSION LOW CLOUDS NEAR THE COAST AT NIGHT.  SOME CONVECTION WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE OVER THE SIERRA MADRES TONIGHT...AND TUESDAY NIGHT...WITH ISOLATED RADAR RETURNS NOW NEAR THE BIG BEND AND ALONG THE RANGE FARTHER SOUTH...BUT IN GENERAL WOULD EXPECT ANY CONVECTION TO MIND ITS MANNERS AND NOT GET TOO CLOSE. SURFACE DEW POINTS ARE STILL ELEVATED IN THE MID 70S...BUT DEEPER MOISTURE APPEARS MORE LIMITED THAN PREVIOUSLY WITH PWAT CLOSER TO 1.5 INCHES.  TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...AS THE MID LEVEL LOW PRESSURE MOVES NORTHEAST...A BACK DOOR FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTH OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. THE FRONT WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THE AREA...MAINLY HELPING TO TRIGGER CONVECTION OVER EAST TEXAS AND THE GULF COAST.  LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...BRIEF H5 RIDGE EXPECTED TO KEEP CONDITIONS CALM FOR ONE MORE DAY ON WEDNESDAY AS THE NEXT H5 TROUGH LINES UP ON TEXAS FOR THE WEEKEND. CONSISTENT TEMPERATURE REGIME REMAINS ON WEDNESDAY WITH HIGHS AGAIN REACHING AROUND 90. MODELS BECOMING MORE CONSISTENT ON CONVECTIVE FORMATION ON THURSDAY ON THE MOUNTAINS IN MEXICO MOVING NEWD INTO THE WESTERN CWA. POP CHANCES AGAIN FOCUSED ON AREAS WEST OF US281...WITH THE LOWER VALLEY IN THE MORE STABLE REGIME. THE MAIN CRUX OF THE WAVE WRAPPING AROUND THE H5 TROUGH MOVES THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING...WITH CONTINUED SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY FOR THE NORTHERN COUNTIES. SATURDAY WILL BE BETWEEN TWO LOBES...WITH WEAK AND BRIEF RIDGING CAPPING OFF THE VALLEY. THE NEXT SHORTWAVE LOBE WRAPS AROUND THE ADVANCING TROUGH LATE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING...WITH ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. MODELS KEEP THE RAIN CHANCES GOING THROUGH SUNDAY AND INTO THE FIRST OF NEXT WEEK AS THE H5 TROUGH OPENS UP AND SWEEPS ACROSS TEXAS.  MARINE... NOW THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS ANCHORED OVER THE CENTRAL GULF WITH LOWER PRESSURE INLAND. EXPECT MODERATE SOUTHEAST WINDS AND MODERATE SEAS THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. SMALL CRAFT SHOULD EXERCISE CAUTION CONDITIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE AT TIMES.  WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY....SOUTHEAST FLOW DOMINATES THE COASTAL WATERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED...REACHING AROUND 15 KNOTS EACH AFTERNOON. THIS WILL KEEP SEAS GENERALLY 3 TO 4 FEET THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK. WEEKEND FORECAST NOTES LOW PRESSURE DEEPENING IN COLORADO...WHICH WILL INCREASE WINDS AND SEAS...ESPECIALLY SUNDAY. CURRENT SEAS FORECAST REACH 6 TO 8 FEET ON SUNDAY...WHICH WOULD NECESSITATE ADVISORIES.  
/06Z TAFS/  Showers and thunderstorms with very heavy rain will reduce visibility and ceilings to MVFR or IFR overnight, across much of the area northwest of a line from Mertzon to San Angelo to Abilene. The KSJT and KABI taf sites will be affected. Other scattered showers/thunderstorms will develop overnight and may temporarily affect our southern TAF sites. Outside of the convection, some low cloud development is expected with ceilings in the 800-1500 ft range, overnight through mid- morning Tuesday. Additional development of showers and thunderstorms is expected Tuesday afternoon and evening, although there is uncertainty at this time with the specific placement. Further TAF adjustments will be made with subsequent updates.  19  
AVIATION... /00Z TAFS/ Mainly VFR conditions are expected through much of this evening. Widespread stratus will spread north across West Central Texas late tonight through much of Tuesday, with MVFR/IFR ceilings at the terminals. Also, a few storms are possible this evening along the I-10 corridor, and will add a VCTS to the KSOA terminal. Also, a complex of storms will probably move across the Big Country Tuesday morning and early afternoon and gone with 5SM -TSRA and the KABI terminal between 12Z and 15Z.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 338 PM CDT Mon May 18 2015/  SHORT TERM... (Tonight and Tuesday)  
FLASH FLOOD WATCH through this evening FOR THE FOLLOWING ZONES: Callahan...Coke...Fisher...Haskell...Jones...Nolan...Runnels... Shackelford...Sterling...Taylor...Throckmorton.  
AND MODELS CONTINUE TO FURTHER WEAKEN THE STORMS HOWEVER WILL ADD A TEMPO FOR TSRA AT LRD FOR THE NEXT FEW HOURS AS IT SLOWLY APPROACHES. ELSEWHERE...QUIETER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED. MVFR CIGS BETWEEN 1500-2500 FT WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE NIGHT BEFORE SLOWLY LIFTING BETWEEN 13Z-18Z. CONVECTION WILL REMAIN POSSIBLE TOWARD VCT DURING THE MID-LATE MORNING WHERE A WEAK BOUNDARY AND CONVERGENCE RESIDES. WITH BEST DYNAMICS FARTHER NORTH...AM NOT WANTING TO ADD ANY MENTION OF THUNDER SO WILL MAINTAIN VCSH IN TAFS. BREEZY CONDITIONS WITH GUSTS UP TO 20 KNOTS ARE EXPECTED MID MORNING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. A RETURN OF MVFR CIGS EXPECTED AFTER 00Z.  
DISCUSSION...MINOR CHANGES AT BEST TO PREVIOUS PACKAGE. MAIN ISSUE WILL BE WHETHER ANY CONVECTION GETS ACROSS THE RIO GRANDE OVERNIGHT. RADAR TRENDS ARE TO DEVELOP CONVECTION FARTHER WEST AND WEAKEN IT OVERNIGHT...SOME MAY CROSS THE RIVER BEFORE DISSIPATING. PREVIOUS FORECAST SEEMS TO HAVE THIS WELL IN HAND. FOR THE REST OF THE PACKAGE (ESPECIALLY TONIGHT) FORECAST IS DOING WELL. DID MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO WINDS AND SKY COVER HOWEVER...BASED ON CURRENT OBSERVATIONS AND SATELLITE DATA. PRODUCTS ARE OUT.  MARINE...WINDS WILL BE CLOSE TO SCEC AND MAY GO WITH THAT ALTHOUGH OUTPUT IS GIVING 15 KNOTS. OBSERVATIONS ARE RUNNING AROUND 15 -19 KNOTS...SO MAY GO WITH SCEC SOME LOCATIONS AND THEN 15 KNOTS LATER TONIGHT.  
TX...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK THROUGH THIS EVENING FOR THE FOLLOWING      ZONES: ARANSAS...CALHOUN...KLEBERG...NUECES.  GM...NONE.  
 
MVFR CEILINGS HAVE DEVELOPMENT OVER THE HILL COUNTRY AND SAT METRO AREA WEST TO THE RIO GRANDE...AND SHOULD DEVELOP/EXPAND INTO THE AUS TERMINAL OVERNIGHT. EVENTUALLY SHOULD SEE IFR CEILINGS DEVELOPING 08Z-11Z. ISOLATED SHRAS ALSO OCCURRING THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT...POSSIBLY INCREASING IN COVERAGE AFTER 15Z ALONG THE I-35 CORRIDOR. ISOLATED TSTMS ALSO POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT ACROSS WESTERN AREAS OF THE CWA BETWEEN SAT-DRT-LRD. CEILINGS RISING BACK TO MVFR AFTER 16Z AND EVENTUALLY VFR 18Z-21Z.  
Please see the 06Z aviation discussion below.  
Showers and thunderstorms continue tonight, and while the bulk of activity has shifted east of area terminals, high-resolution guidance indicates the potential for additional development across SE NM late tonight which would move east across northern portions of the area, impacting KPEQ, KINK, and KMAF toward daybreak. Have included TEMPOs to account for associated SHRA/TSRA, and will continue to monitor tonight. Other concern is for low-end MVFR/IFR fog and low ceiling development late tonight lasting through early Tuesday morning. Any low ceilings that develop should gradually improve to VFR by late Tuesday morning. Otherwise, breezy southerly to southeasterly winds will continue through the forecast period.  
UPDATE...  Have updated the forecast to drop mention of the severe thunderstorm watch.  DISCUSSION...  Convection has waned a bit over the Permian Basin but redevelopment is expected as warm upglide gins up further storms. With all the outflow boundaries around, it`s hard to say where, but the southern portions of the Basin stand to get the best shot of precip overnight. Heavy rainfall is still indicated, and a flash flood watch remains in effect until Tuesday afternoon for the upper Trans Pecos, Permian Basin, and western Low Rolling Plains portions of west Texas, and all of southeastern New Mexico.  
NM...FLASH FLOOD WATCH through Tuesday morning FOR THE FOLLOWING      ZONES... Central Lea County...Eddy County Plains...Northern      Lea County...Southern Lea County.

MODELS COMING INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE CONVECTIVE FORECAST AND IT MAKES SENSE GIVEN THE RECENT TRENDS. BELIEVE WE WILL HAVE A BAND OF SHOWERS OR POSSIBLE STORMS MOVE THROUGH DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS FROM THE SOUTHWEST. WILL SHOW SHOWERS IN THE TAF FROM 11-15Z...BUT MAY NEED TO ADD THUNDER IF CONFIDENCE IN THIS WAVE OF ACTIVITY GROWS. A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS WILL DEVELOP DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS WITH LITTLE CIN. MODEL GUIDANCE SEEMS TO BE IN AGREEMENT IN A SHORTWAVE TROUGH PIVOTING THROUGH DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS WITH STRONGER FORCING SPREADING ACROSS THE REGION. HAVE INSERTED VCTS FROM 18-23Z WHICH IS THE MORE LIKELY WINDOW FOR AT LEAST SCATTERED CONVECTION. THE 4KM WRF IS SHOWING A SOLID LINE DURING THIS TIME.  MVFR CIGS WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION DURING THE NEXT FEW HOURS. CIGS MAY LOWER TO IFR AROUND DAYBREAK DUE TO MOIST EASTERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW. CIGS WILL LIFT DURING THE MORNING HOURS AND SHOULD BECOME VFR BY EARLY AFTERNOON. VFR WILL PREVAIL OUTSIDE OF ANY STORMS TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. OTHERWISE LIGHT SOUTHEAST WINDS WILL BECOME MORE SOUTHERLY AND INCREASE TO 10-15 KT TOMORROW.  TR.92  
CONVECTION HAS DIMINISHED WITH THE LOSS OF HEATING SO HAVE REDUCED POPS ACROSS THE AREA. THERE REMAINS A SMALL CHANCE FOR A FEW SHOWERS OR STORMS TO FORM OVER THE REGION LATE TONIGHT ALONG THE LEADING EDGE OF A SURGE OF HIGHER GULF MOISTURE THAT MOVES THROUGH THE REGION. WILL RETAIN A 20 POP OVERNIGHT FOR THIS POTENTIAL. OTHERWISE SOME MINOR CHANGES TO TEMPS/SKY/DEWPOINTS WERE MADE TO ACCOUNT FOR LATEST TRENDS.  TR.92  
THE ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN WILL CONTINUE ACROSS NORTH TEXAS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WITH SEVERAL ADDITIONAL CHANCES FOR RAIN AND THUNDERSTORMS AND CONTINUED FLOODING. THE UPPER LEVEL PATTERN CONTINUES TO FAVOR TROUGHING OVER THE WESTERN U.S. AND RIDGING TO THE EAST OF TEXAS. THIS WILL KEEP THE REGION IN AN ACTIVE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK.  ACROSS NORTH TEXAS THIS AFTERNOON...SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S AND DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 70S. THIS YIELDS SURFACE BASED CAPE OF AROUND 2500 J/KG WITH LITTLE INHIBITION. A LACK OF A STRONG FORCING MECHANISM SUGGESTS THAT CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING SHOULD BE PRIMARILY DIURNALLY DRIVEN AND WEAKEN AFTER SUNSET. DEEP LAYER SHEAR IS AROUND 35KTS BUT MOST OF THIS IS IN THE FORM OF STRONGER WINDS ABOVE 700MB. THE FLOW FROM THE SURFACE TO 700MB IS QUITE WEAK AND SURFACE WINDS ARE EAST-SOUTHEAST IN MANY AREAS. THESE OPPOSING WINDS FROM THE SURFACE THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE ATMOSPHERE SHOULD RESULT IN VERY SLOW MOVING CONVECTION WHICH COULD PRODUCE VERY LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINFALL THROUGH THE EVENING. THERE IS A LOW SEVERE WEATHER THREAT MAINLY IN THE FORM OF DAMAGING WINDS FROM COLLAPSING THUNDERSTORMS.  ONE SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL EJECT NORTHEAST THROUGH THE 4-CORNERS REGION OVERNIGHT. THIS WILL ALLOW CONVECTION ACROSS WEST TEXAS TO BECOME MORE ORGANIZED AND MOVE EAST. THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD WEAKEN AS IT CONTINUES EAST...ALTHOUGH THE LATEST GFS SEEMS TO BE SUFFERING FROM SOME SERIOUS CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK AND HANGS ON TO DEEP CONVECTION THROUGH TOMORROW MORNING ACROSS NORTH TEXAS. THE CURRENT FORECAST WONT BE QUITE SO BULLISH ON POPS OVERNIGHT INTO TUESDAY...HOWEVER...IF THE GFS HAS LATCHED ON TO MORE ROBUST FORCING FOR ASCENT...WE MAY HAVE TO RAISE POPS OVERNIGHT.  ON TUESDAY...RAIN CHANCES SHOULD INCREASE AS ANOTHER DISTURBANCE IN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT MOVES ACROSS THE AREA. THIS COINCIDES WITH A SURGE OF MID LEVEL MOISTURE WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BY LATE AFTERNOON...PRIMARILY WEST OF INTERSTATE 35.  ON WEDNESDAY AND WED NIGHT...A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTHWARD AND RAIN/STORM CHANCES SHOULD INCREASE. SOME SEVERE WEATHER WILL BE POSSIBLE DURING THIS TIME BUT THE MAIN THREAT WILL BE FLOODING FROM ADDITIONAL RAINFALL ON SATURATED SOILS. CONTINUED TROUGHING WILL PERSIST OVER THE SOUTHWEST U.S. THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK WITH ADDITIONAL RAIN CHANCES EACH DAY.  NOTE ABOUT FORECAST RAINFALL AMOUNTS AND RAINFALL GRAPHICS...  WITH THE HEAVY RAINFALL OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AND CONTINUED ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN...FORECAST RAINFALL AMOUNTS HAVE BECOME QUITE POPULAR FOR PLANNING PURPOSES. KEEP IN MIND THAT FORECAST RAINFALL AMOUNTS CAN VARY GREATLY OVER SHORT DISTANCES AND HAVE A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS BUILT IN. THESE PRECIPITATION FORECASTS ASSUME THAT THE OVERALL CONVECTIVE FORECAST IS CORRECT ALONG WITH THE LOCATION AND DURATION OF PRECIPITATION. MULTIPLE DAY PRECIPITATION FORECASTS ARE LIKELY TO INCLUDE MORE THAN ONE ROUND OF PRECIPITATION...AND IT SHOULD NOT BE ASSUMED THAT ALL OF THE PRECIPITATION WILL OCCUR AT ONCE.  OUR CURRENT FORECAST PRECIPITATION OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS HAS ANYWHERE FROM AROUND 1 INCH IN OUR SOUTHEAST TO OVER 2 INCHES IN OUR NORTHWEST COUNTIES THROUGH MID WEEK. ANY OF THESE SCATTERED DIURNAL SHOWERS AND STORMS CAN PUT DOWN CONSIDERABLY MORE PRECIPITATION OVER A SHORT DURATION.  DUNN    
CONVECTION ONCE AGAIN TRYING TO DEVELOP SW OF KLBB TERMINAL. PROSPECTS FOR THIS ROUND MORE PROMISING AS 30-40KT LLJ FEEDS MOISTURE NORTHWARD ALONG EXPANDING OUTFLOW/WARM FRONTAL FEATURE. ADDITIONAL LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH SHORTWAVE TROUGH ENTERING THE EASTERN PLAINS OF NM WILL HELP SUSTAIN AND BROADEN CONVECTION OVERNIGHT. WITH UPSLOPE FLOW...MOISTENING PROFILE AND PROSPECTS FOR WIDESPREAD CONVECTION KEPT IFR CIGS IN PLACE FOR ALL TAF SITES WITH INTERMITTENT TSRA. SUBSIDENCE BEHIND EXITING WAVE SHOULD BEGIN TO WIN OUT AFT 18Z FROM W-E BUT HAVE KEPT MVFR CIGS THROUGH TAF CYCLE GIVEN PERSISTENT UPSLOPE AND LACK OF WHOLESALE DRYING.  
MID-AFTERNOON SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTED BROAD E-SE FLOW ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE CWA AHEAD OF A WEAK AND DECAYING COLD FRONT STRETCHING FROM MULESHOE TO CAPROCK CANYONS STATE PARK. WINDS BEHIND THIS FRONT HAD ALREADY VEERED MORE EASTERLY SINCE THIS MORNING IN RESPONSE TO LOWER PRESSURES IN EASTERN NM...SO THE UPSHOT OF THIS IS THAT A RESERVOIR OF GULF MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE FEEDING INTO THE REGION TONIGHT FREE OF INTERRUPTIONS. THIS MOISTURE HAS ALREADY BEEN ASCENDING NWD ATOP THE REGION AS CONFIRMED BY SOME ACCAS AND MID- LEVEL VIRGA AT TIMES...BUT FARTHER SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST LIES BETTER LL MOISTURE AND SUBSEQUENTLY HIGHER CAPE. MODEL CONSENSUS IS FOR SCATTERED TSTORMS TO DEVELOP FROM THE DAVIS MOUNTAINS NWD TO AROUND LEA COUNTY AND SPREAD NE THIS EVENING. BEST THREAT FOR SEVERE STORMS STILL LOOKS TO FAVOR AREAS TO OUR S-SW WHERE MOISTURE WILL BE COMPARABLY DEEPER...BUT A FEW SEVERE MODES MAY SURVIVE THEIR JOURNEY NORTHWARD INTO LOWER CAPE BEFORE TRANSITIONING MORE TOWARD NON- SEVERE STORMS.  ALTHOUGH LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN WILL OCCUR WITH SOME STORMS THIS EVENING...OUR GREATEST CONCERN LIES IN THE OVERNIGHT HOURS THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING WHEN ISENTROPIC ASCENT ACCELERATES IN ADVANCE OF A LEAD TROUGH AND IMPROVED SWLY CYCLONIC FLOW. DEEP SELY FLOW UP TO 700MB WILL ADVECT A SURGE OF PWATS BETWEEN 1.3 AND ALMOST 2 INCHES OVER MUCH OF THE REGION. GREATEST FOCUS FOR WRINGING OUT THIS MOISTURE WILL BE A 35 KNOT SELY LLJ AND A DEVELOPING WARM FRONT ACROSS THE NRN PERMIAN BASIN...PERHAPS AIDED/ENHANCED BY CONVECTIVE OUTFLOWS TO ITS NORTH. WPC FAVORS THIS THINKING AND HAS TRENDED HEAVILY TOWARD THE GFS /WHICH PROVED ACCURATE TWO WEEKS AGO IN A SIMILAR FLOOD SETUP IN LYNN COUNTY AND SURROUNDING AREAS/...SO WE HAVE OPTED FOR AN AREAL FLOOD WATCH FOR OUR SOUTHERN TWO ROWS OF COUNTIES THRU NOON TUESDAY AT WHICH POINT THE DEPARTING IMPULSE AND VEERING LLJ WILL CARRY THE BRUNT OF PRECIP EAST OF THE REGION.  IN THE WAKE OF THESE STORMS...COOL/MOIST SELY FLOW COULD GREATLY LIMIT THE EXTENT OF AFTERNOON DESTABILIZATION AHEAD OF A DRYLINE IN ERN NM. THIS CONCERN IS CITED BY SPC...HOWEVER DRIER MID-LEVEL AIR BEHIND THE LEAD IMPULSE WILL GARNER STEEPER LAPSE RATES AT THE EXPENSE OF SOME SUBSIDENCE. WE DID SIDE WITH A MORE WESTERLY DRYLINE LOCATION BY MID-AFTERNOON SIMILAR TO THE GFS GIVEN LIKELY CONVECTIVE OUTFLOWS IMPEDING THE DRYLINE/S EASTWARD PROGRESS. AT THE VERY LEAST THERE SHOULD BE A NARROW CORRIDOR OF DECENT CAPE SUPPORTIVE FOR SEVERE STORMS...BUT THE OVERALL COVERAGE OF SUCH MAY BE TEMPERED HEAVILY BY LIMITED BACKGROUND ASCENT. ANY STORMS THAT DO DEVELOP WILL BE IN A FAVORABLY SHEARED ENVIRONMENT FOR SUPERCELLS COMPLETE WITH AN ATTENDANT THREAT FOR TORNADOES GIVEN LOW LCL AND LFC HEIGHTS. MAX TEMPS WERE COOLED OFF BY SEVERAL DEGREES MAINLY IN OUR EASTERN COUNTIES WHERE MORNING PRECIP AND THICK STRATUS WILL BE MOST PREVALENT.  LONG TERM...  LONG TERM FORECAST REMAINS ON TRACK FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF CLOUDY SKIES...COOLER THAN NORMAL TEMPS AND SEVERAL ROUNDS OF STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WITH PERIODS OF HEAVY RAINFALL THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  TUESDAY OVERNIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY WILL FEATURE WIDESPREAD RAINFALL FROM EARLIER IN THE DAY TUESDAY BEGINNING TO TAPER OFF AS THE FIRST WAVE EXITS NORTHEAST WHILE SWEEPING A COLD FRONT SOUTH THROUGH THE TEXAS PANHANDLE THROUGH EARLY MORNING HOURS AND THE SOUTH/ROLLING PLAINS BY EARLY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. COOLER AIR BEHIND THE FRONT WILL HELP LIMIT INSTABILITY SOMEWHAT LESSENING THE POTENTIAL FOR THUNDERSTORMS LATER IN THE AFTERNOON/EVENING REACHING SEVERE LEVELS...BUT GIVEN PWATS STEADILY REMAINING BETWEEN 1.0 AND 1.5 INCHES WITH STEEP LAPSE RATES AND DECENT ELEVATED CAPE CANNOT RULE OUT SOME MARGINALLY SEVERE HAIL OR WIND GUSTS WITH STRONGEST STORMS ESPECIALLY ALONG THE RETREATING DRYLINE.  SOUTHEAST UPSLOPE SURFACE FLOW RETURNS OVERNIGHT WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY AS THE UPPER LEVEL LOW APPROACHES FROM THE WEST. DEEP BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE WILL BACK THE DRYLINE UP AGAINST THE MOUNTAINS IN NEW MEXICO AS BAROCLINIC INSTABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH STRONG WAVE LEADS TO ENHANCED ISENTROPIC LIFT ACROSS EASTERN NEW MEXICO. WIDE SPREAD RAIN WITH EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS WILL PROGRESSIVELY MIGRATE OUT OF NEW MEXICO INTO WEST TEXAS THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND NIGHT ON THURSDAY.  AS THE UA LOW MARCHES NORTHEAST FOR FRIDAY WE WILL SEE MORE CLASSIC DRYLINE CONVECTION AND A TRIPLE POINT ALIGNED ACROSS THE SOUTH PLAINS AND TEXAS/NEW MEXICO BORDER. THIS WOULD ENHANCE SEVERE POTENTIAL ESPECIALLY IF MORE HEATING IS ALLOWED THAN CURRENTLY PROGGED. FOCUS FOR THE WEEKEND SHIFTS EAST SLIGHTLY TO THE ROLLING PLAINS AS THE SYSTEM SLOWLY PROGRESSES NORTHEAST. STRONG TO SEVERE TSTORMS WITH MORE HEAVY RAIN CANT BE RULED OUT IN OUR AREA OVER THE WEEKEND BUT SHOULD BE MORE FOCUSED ON THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA.  WORTH NOTING THAT WPC GUIDANCE HAS A LARGE SWATH OF 5 INCHES TO 7 INCHES OF RAIN BY THIS TIME NEXT WEEK WHICH WOULD BREAK THE ALL TIME RECORD FOR MAY RAINFALL SET IN 1941 WITH MORE THAN A WEEK LEFT IN MAY 2015. WITH MODELS HINTING TOWARD ANOTHER LARGE TROUGH/UA FOR NEXT WEEK...PUTTING THE ALL TIME RAINFALL RECORD FOR ANY GIVEN MONTH 
FLOOD WATCH THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON FOR TXZ033>044.  
NO REAL CHANGES TO THE FORECAST OF 6 HOURS AGO...OTHER THAN A COUPLE OF TIMING ADJUSTMENTS.  MVFR CEILINGS WILL LOWER INTO IFR RANGE BETWEEN 07Z AND 10Z TUESDAY.  OCCASIONAL THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED AT ALL TERMINALS AFTER 07Z TUESDAY WITH OCCASIONAL LIFR CONDITIONS LIKELY.  IFR CEILINGS EXPECTED TO PERSIST THROUGH THE DAY AND EVENING ON TUESDAY.  COLD FRONT EXPECTED TO BRING SURFACE WIND SHIFT TO NORTHERLY AROUND 06Z WEDNESDAY AT NORTHERN TERMINALS...WITH NO IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT EXPECTED.  COCKRELL  
AVIATION... MODERATE TO STRONG EASTERLY UPSLOPE FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO DRAW LOW- LEVEL MOISTURE INTO THE FORECAST AREA.  BY 05Z TUESDAY...EXPECT MVFR CEILINGS TO DEVELOP.  RAPID DETERIORATION OF FLIGHT CATEGORIES EXPECTED TO FOLLOW WITH WITH ALL TERMINALS LOWERING TO IFR CEILINGS BY 09Z TUESDAY.  THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED AT ALL TERMINALS AFTER 07Z TUESDAY WITH OCCASIONAL LIFR CONDITIONS LIKELY.  THESE POOR FLYING CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO PERSIST THROUGH THE DAY ON TUESDAY.  COCKRELL  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 357 PM CDT MON MAY 18 2015/  DISCUSSION...  AN ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD WITH SEVERAL CHANCES FOR RAIN. CHALLENGES FOR THIS FORECAST INCLUDE HEAVY RAIN/FLOODING POTENTIAL...FRONTAL POSITION...TEMPERATURES...AND POSSIBILE WINDOW FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPEMENT. THESE UNCERTAINTIES ARE LARGELY A RESULT OF SUBTLE DIFFERENCES WITH FLOW PATTERN ALOFT AND REFLECTION AT THE SURFACE. IN THE NEAR TERM...CONFIDENCE IS HIGH ON YET ANOTHER WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION EVENT TONIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST EARLY TOMORROW. THIS EVENT SHOULD BE FAIRLY LOW IMPACT IN THE ABSCENCE OF SIGNIFICANT INSTABILITY ALTHOUGH SATURATED SOILS PARTICULARLY IN THE EAST RAISES SOME CONCERN FOR MINOR FLOODING. EVEN AN INCH OR TWO IN A 36 HOUR PERIOD MAY BE ENOUGH FOR SOME FLOOD CONCERNS.  PRESSURE ADVECTION AND SATURATION ON ISENTROPIC SURFACES MAXIMIZE FOR A PERIOD BEGINNING EARLY TONIGHT IN THE WEST AND SPREADING EAST THROUGH THE NIGHT. THE BULK OF THIS SHOULD MOVE EAST OF THE AREA BY LATE MORNING OR EARLY AFTERNOON. PWAT VALUES OF AROUND THE 99TH PERCENTILE SUGGEST POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAINFALL BUT PROGRESSIVE NATURE SHOULD LIMIT A MORE SIGNIFICANT FLOOD CONCERN. THE PLAN IS TO HOLD OFF ON A FLOOD WATCH AND HANDLE THIS EVENT WITH FLOOD ADVISORIES WHERE NECESSARY AS THE EVENT UNFOLDS THROUGH THE NIGHT AND INTO TOMORROW MORNING.  MEANWHILE THE SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL DEAMPLIFY/WEAKEN WITH RESIDUAL 50-60 KNOT 500 MB SPEED MAX OVERSPREADING THE AREA BY AFTERNOON. THIS IS WHEN SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES EMERGE. MODELS HAVE STRUGGLED WITH MESOSCALE DETAILS AS OF LATE WHEN OVERNIGHT CONVECTION IS EXTENSIVE THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND TOMORROW WILL PROBABLY BE NO EXCEPTION. MEAN FLOW ORIENTATION AND MAGNITUDE WOULD GENERALLY FAVOR AN EASTWARD MIXING DRYLINE ALTHOUGH WITH DOWNWARD TRENDS IN MOMENTUM BY PEAK MIXING AND FAIRLY DEEP LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THE DRYLINE TO SHARPEN SIGNIFICANTLY AND MIX TOO FAR EAST. THERE IS SOME QUESTION ON THE LEVEL OF DESTABILIZIATION THAT CAN OCCUR DURING THE AFTERNOON. CURRENT THINKING IS THAT IN THE WAKE OF WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION SOME DIABATIC HEATING AND POCKETS OF AT LEAST MODEST INSTABILITY SHOULD FORM BY MID AFTERNOON. SCATTERED CONVECTION SHOULD GRADUALLY INCREASE IN INTENSITY AND POSE A MARGINAL SEVERE WEATHER THREAT DURING THE AFTERNOON GIVEN SUFFICIENT DEEP LAYER SHEAR AND BACKED LOW LEVEL WINDS. MOST MODELS SHOW A LOW LEVEL THETA-E AXIS EXTENDING NORTHWESTWARD ACROSS ROUGHLY THE SOUTHWESTERN HALF OF THE TEXAS PANHANDLE AND THIS MAY BE COINCIDENT WITH THE MOST INTENSE CONVECTION DURING THE AFTERNOON. ALL OF THIS WILL DEPEND ON DIFFICULT TO RESOLVE MESOSCALE FEATURES/BOUNDARIES THAT WILL STRONGLY BE TIED TO OVERNIGHT/EARLY MORNING CONVECTION. A MORE CONFIDENT FORECAST WILL REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF OBSERVATIONAL TRENDS LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY TOMORROW MORNING.  SOME OF THE GUIDANCE IS SLIGHTLY MORE PERTURBED WITH MEAN SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW INTO WEDNESDAY AND THEREBY MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH A SOUTHWARD INTRUSION OF COOL/DRY AIR MASS INTO AT LEAST THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE AREA. GFS IS THE OUTLIER AND LESS AGRESSIVE WITH SOUTHWARD MOVEMENT OF THE COLD FRONT. HAVE SIDED WITH THE HIGHER RESOLUTION NAM AND WRF AND THE SREF AND ECMWF FOR FRONTAL TIMING...WINDS AND TEMPERATURES. WE HAVE CONSIERABLY COOLER TEMPERATURES THAN MOST STATISTICAL GUIDANCE FOR WEDNESDAY. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW DRY SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT ABOVE MOIST NORTHEASTERLY/EASTERLY LOW LEVELS. GIVEN STEADY HEIGHT RISES AND SIGNS OF CAPPING INVERSION AT THE TOP OF THE MOIST LOW LEVELS IN FORECAST SOUNDINGS BELIEVE PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION IS QUITE LOW. DEPENDING ON HOW THIS EVOLVES THERE IS SOME POTENTIAL FOR MOIST UPSLOPE AND COOLER AIR MASS TO RESULT IN PERSISTIENT LOW CLOUDS AND FOG THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY ON WEDESDAY.  BY THURSDAY EVENING A LEAD SHORTWAVE APPROACHES AND HEIGHT FALLS OCCUR SO RETAINED LOW PRECIPITATION PROBABITLIES. THE MAGNITUDE OF ASCENT AND PRESENCE OF ANOMALOUS MOISTURE JUSTIFIES RELATIVELY HIGH PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES FOR THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING. AS THE MAIN UPPER LOW EJECTS NORTHEASTWARD FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY THERE WILL LIKELY BE ANOTHER PERIOD OF PRECIPITATION. CONTINUED MOIST SOUTHEASTERLY LOW LEVEL TRAJECTORIES AND PWAT VALUES OVER ONE INCH (POSSIBLY AGAIN REACHING OR EXCEEDING THE 75TH PERCENTILE) RAISES CONCERN FOR FLOODING. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR TWO SUCCESSIVE WAVES OF PRECIPITATION (POTENTIALLY HEAVY) IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME...ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND AGAIN FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY. TIMING/PLACEMENT OF EACH ROUND OF PRECIPITATION IN THE EXTENDED REMAINS UNCERTAIN GIVEN TYPICAL INCREASED SPREAD IN THE ENSEMBLES AND UNRESOLVED SMALLER SCALE DETAILS.  BRB

7PM TO 1AM AND FROM 1AM TO 7AM TUESDAY. RAIN CHANCES IN FIRST BLOCK WERE DROPPED ACROSS SE ZONES WITH WEATHER MENTION REMOVED AND CHANCES ENHANCED IN FAR NE TOWARDS BURNET AND WILLIAMSON. THE SECOND BLOCK CONTINUES HIGHER CHANCES OUT WEST AND ACROSS HILL COUNTRY WHERE NEW ACTIVITY SHOULD FESTER THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. HOURLY TEMP AND DEWPOINTS WERE ON TRACK. SEE DISCUSSION BELOW FOR MORE DETAILS ON OVERNIGHT PERIOD.  
SOME STORMS BECOME STRONG TO SEVERE ACROSS LLANO AND PORTIONS OF BURNET AND WILLIAMSON THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING. THIS INSTABILITY IS WANING AND THIS SECTOR OF THE REGION SHOULD DIMINISH IN RAIN COVERAGE THROUGH THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. FARTHER WEST...THE BEST LOW TO MID LEVEL FORCING HAVE BEEN FARTHER NORTH AND WEST TOWARDS MIDLAND AND SAN ANGELO WITH A SE MOVING STORM NOTED IN MEXICO WEST OF MAVERICK. WITH DRIER H850 AIR MOVING IN ACROSS THE EAST THIRD...THE MAIN AREA TO WATCH WILL BE OUT WEST AND THE HILL COUNTRY. BOTH GFS/NAM INDICATE ANOTHER WAVE MIGRATING OVER THE REGION AFTER MIDNIGHT AND WITH GREATEST MOISTURE DEPTH ALONG RIO GRANDE PLAINS AND HILL COUNTRY...FEEL THIS IS THE BEST AREA FOR FESTERING SHOWERS AND STORMS. ISENTROPIC UPGLIDE STRENGTH WILL BE GREATEST NORTH TOWARDS SAN ANGELO BUT SOME ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT SHOULD OCCUR THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND HILL COUNTRY AND POSSIBLY INTO THE NORTH I-35 CORRIDOR THROUGH THE MORNING TUESDAY. POCKETS OF HEAVY RAINFALL COULD OCCUR GIVEN HIGH PWATS AND SLOW OVERALL MOTIONS AT 5-10 MPH TO THE EAST PER CORFIDI VECTORS. AM NOT EXPECTING A BULLSEYE OF PRECIPITATION LIKE LAST NIGHT BUT SOME HEAVY POCKETS OF 1-2" CAN NOT BE RULED OUT. THE CONTINUED ACTIVE PATTERN LOOKS TO REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH MUCH OF THE WEEK.  
AVIATION.../00Z TAFS/ SCT TSRA FORMING ALONG THE HIGH TERRAIN OF MEXICO MAY SNEAK INTO DRT OVER THE NEXT THREE HOURS. CONSIDERING CONVECTIVE TRENDS KEEP TSRA SOUTH OF DRT AND MODEL GUIDANCE IS SPLIT ON HOW FAR NORTH AND EAST COVERAGE WILL SPREAD AS A WEAK DISTURBANCE PROGRESS ACROSS THE RIO GRAND PLAINS...DECIDED TO CARRY VCTS THERE FOR NOW. ISO TSRA SHOULD REMAIN NORTH AND WEST OF AUS...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MOVING SOUTH FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT.  MOIST SOUTHEAST FLOW WITH WEAK ASCENT WILL ONCE AGAIN CAUSE CIGS TO LOWER TO MVFR BETWEEN 3-6Z AND IFR BETWEEN 6-9Z BEFORE LIFTING TO MVFR BETWEEN 15-18Z AND VFR AFTER 18Z. CIGS MAY BRIEFLY LOWER TO LIFR BETWEEN 9-12Z...BUT GUIDANCE EXCLUDING THE GFS HAS TRENDED AWAY FROM THAT. ISO TO SCT SHRA AND TSRA MAY DEVELOP AGAIN ALONG A WEAK SW-NE ORIENTED SURFACE BOUNDARY TOMORROW...BUT COVERAGE AND CONFIDENCE TOO LOW TO INCLUDE VCTS AT THIS TIME.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 259 PM CDT MON MAY 18 2015/  SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)... ALL IS QUIET THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BUT THINGS SHOULD START TO PICK UP LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING MAINLY ALONG THE WESTERN CWA. 12Z UPPER ANALYSIS SHOWED THIS AREA UNDER SOUTHWEST FLOW WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN 500 HEIGHT BUT STEEP MID- LEVEL LAPSE RATES. 850 MB ANALYSIS SHOWS THE 850 DEWPOINT AT KDRT TO BE 14C WHICH SIGNIFIES VERY RICH LOW-LEVEL AIRMASS. LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS HAS THE DRYLINE PRETTY FAR TO THE WEST...BUT HI-RES MODEL GUIDANCE IS PERSISTENT WITH INITIATING CONVECTION WEST OF THE RIO GRANDE LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS APPEARS TO BE BEGINNING AT THE PRESENT TIME. THE BIG QUESTION WILL BE HOW MUCH ACTIVITY THERE WILL BE AND WHETHER OR NOT IF FORMS INTO A CONVECTIVE COMPLEX. ANY COMPLEX WOULD HAVE A STORM MOTION THAT WOULD BRING IT INTO OUR WESTERN/SOUTHWESTERN COUNTIES AFTER 00Z. WILL CARRY THE HIGHEST POPS FOR THIS LOCATION AND ALSO MENTION LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL IN THE FORECAST GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE IN PLACE. PW VALUES ARE GREATER THAN 2 STANDARD DEVIATIONS ABOVE NORMAL. SEVERE PARAMETERS WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE POSSIBILITY OF SEVERE WEATHER AND SPC HAS PLACED VAL VERDE COUNTY AND SOME OF MAVERICK AND KINNEY COUNTY IN A SLIGHT RISK WITH A MARGINAL RISK A BIT FARTHER EAST. THE MAIN CONCERN WILL BE HEAVY RAIN ACROSS AREAS WHICH HAS ALREADY SEEN HEAVY RAINFALL...AND THIS IS PRIMARILY THE SOUTHEASTERN COUNTIES. WILL FORGO A FLASH FLOOD WATCH NOW AS THE CONFIDENCE IN THERE BEING ENOUGH ACTIVITY TO BRING A MCS INTO OUR CWA IS LOW...BUT THIS IS POSSIBLE AND SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE WATCHED THIS EVENING. THE OTHER CONCERN THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT IS ANY OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES THAT ARE AROUND THE AREA. THIS MORNING ON VISIBLE SATELLITE WE COULD SEE AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MOVING WEST FROM THE EARLY MORNING ACTIVITY. CANT FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF THE BOUNDARY ANY MORE ON SATELLITE OR ON A SURFACE ANALYSIS BUT THIS DOES NOT MEAN IT IS NOT THERE. THE LLJ WILL BE QUITE STRONG AGAIN TONIGHT AND THERE COULD BE REGENERATION OF ACTIVITY ON ANY OLD OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES IN PLACE ACROSS THE CWA.  FOR TOMORROW...THE BEST LOW-LEVEL LIFT SEEN ON 850 THETA-E ADVECTION CHARTS WILL BE ACROSS THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN ZONES AND WILL CARRY THE BEST POPS FOR THESE LOCATIONS. ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE SCATTERED BUT THE STRONGER ACTIVITY WILL BE CAPABLE OF BRIEF HEAVY RAIN. ANY SEVERE CONVECTION SHOULD BE LIMITED TO AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM IN OUR WESTERN COUNTIES...CLOSER TO THE DRYLINE.  FOR TUESDAY NIGHT...THE UPPER LOW CURRENTLY OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL BE MOVING EAST AND AS IT DOES SO CONVECTION SHOULD INCREASE NEAR THE LUBBOCK AREA. THIS CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO GROW INTO A CONVECTIVE COMPLEX AND MCS PROPAGATION VECTORS WILL BRING ANY SYSTEM NEAR OUR NORTHERN ZONES. THINK THE BULK OF THE ACTIVITY WILL REMAIN TO THE NORTH AND WILL CARRY 20 POPS FOR NOW.  LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)... SHOULD SEE A BRIEF LULL IN ACTIVITY ON WEDNESDAY AS SHORTWAVE RIDGING MOVES ACROSS THE AREA. THE FORECAST THEN RETURNS WET WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THERE REMAINS DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE GFS AND OTHER MODEL GUIDANCE ON THE HANDLING OF A COLD FRONT WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. AS HAS BEEN THE NORM FOR THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS...ANOTHER UPPER LOW WILL PUSH INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AT THE SAME TIME THE PREVIOUS UPPER LOW TRACKS THROUGH THE NORTHERN PLAINS. THE LATTER WILL SEND A COLD FRONT SOUTH...BUT IT SHOULD HAVE A HARD TIME MOVING SOUTH AT SOME POINT GIVEN THE SW WINDS ALOFT. THE MAIN DRIVING FOR THE SOUTHWARD PROPAGATION OF THE FRONT SHOULD BE DUE TO CONVECTION/COLD POOLS. WILL CONTINUE TO GO WITH THE CONSENSUS AND HAVE HIGHER POPS DURING THIS TIME FRAME. ADDITIONAL HEAVY RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE.  FOR THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND...THE UPPER LOW WILL DEPART THE SW CONUS AND WILL PASS CLOSER TO OUR AREA THAN THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD KEEP THE HIGHER RAIN CHANCES ONGOING. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF HAVE STRONG SIGNALS FOR HEAVY RAIN SATURDAY NIGHT OR SUNDAY. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS FOR ANY CHANGES. WE MUST CONTINUE TO STRESS...WITH RECENT HEAVY RAINFALL AND POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY LATER THIS WEEK AND AGAIN THIS WEEKEND...WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE POSSIBLE FLASH FLOODING. PLEASE CONTINUE TO STRESS THE TURN AROUND DOWN DROWN SLOGAN AS WE CONTINUE THE ABOVE NORMAL RAINFALL.  
/ISSUED 703 PM CDT MON MAY 18 2015/ CONVECTION CONTINUES IN THE REGION BUT SO FAR TAF SITES HAVE ESCAPED ANY ACTIVITY ON STATION AND WILL KEEP MENTION OUT OF TAFS. WACO AND ARLINGTON WOULD BE THE SITES WITH THE MOST POTENTIAL FOR CONVECTION DURING THE NEXT 2 HOURS AND WILL MONITOR RADAR TRENDS FOR UPDATES. CONVECTION SHOULD DIMINISH AFTER SUNSET...BUT HI-RES NAM IS INDICATING POTENTIAL FOR CONVECTION LATE TONIGHT WHICH IS TREATED AS AN OUTLIER FOR NOW.  WILL BRING MVFR/IFR STRATUS IN LATE TONIGHT...ALTHOUGH CONFIDENCE IN IFR IS NOT OVERLY HIGH GIVEN LOW SREF PROBABILITIES. HOWEVER WITH THE EASTERLY FLOW IN THE LOW LEVELS AND EXPECTED NEAR SURFACE SATURATION...FELT IT WAS BEST TO SHOW A TEMPO FOR IFR FROM 11-15Z. CIGS WILL LIFT DURING THE LATE MORNING HOURS WITH VFR EXPECTED BY EARLY AFTERNOON.  AN UNSTABLE AND UNCAPPED AIRMASS WILL EXIST OVER THE REGION TUESDAY. THE CONVECTIVE FORECAST BECOMES PROBLEMATIC AS MODEL GUIDANCE IS WILDLY VARYING ON TIMING AND COVERAGE. AM UNABLE TO PICK A MOST LIKELY WINDOW AT THIS TIME AND TO AVOID A LOW CONFIDENCE LENGTHY MENTION OF VCTS WILL OMIT IT FROM THE TAF AT THIS TIME...BUT IT MAY BE ADDED LATER.  TR.92   
WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING...THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DISSIPATED BETWEEN HOUSTON AND COLLEGE STATION. HOWEVER...AN ANALYSIS OF THE 00Z SURFACE AND UPPER AIR CHARTS SHOWED A SURFACE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY LOCATED FROM HOUSTON TO BRENHAM...850 MB DEWPOINTS BETWEEN 10 AND 12 CELCIUS AND 700 MB DEWPOINTS BETWEEN 2 AND 4 CELCIUS OVER THE SURFACE BOUNDARY...A 500 MB SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING EASTWARD ACROSS WEST TEXAS...AND A DIFFLUENT ZONE OVERHEAD SE TEXAS AT 300 AND 200 MB. THE NAMBUFR FORECAST SOUNDINGS GIVE MU CAPE VALUES OF AT LEAST 2700 SOUTH OF THE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND 6 AM AND INCREASED THIS TO OVER 3000 AFTER SUNRISE. THE HIGH RESOLUTION SHORT TERM MODELS ALL SHOWED THE DISSIPATING EVENING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. HOWEVER...THE RAP13 HAS DONE THE BEST JOB SO FAR AND FORECASTS A BEGINNING OF CONVECTION ALONG THE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY ALONG THE INTERSTATE 10 CORRIDOR AROUND AND AFTER SUNRISE TUESDAY MORNING.  FOR THE UPDATE...COULD NOT RULE OUT ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVERNIGHT TONIGHT...AND KEPT THE POPS AT 20 PERCENT FROM LATE THIS EVENING THROUGH 7 AM. UPPED THE POPS TO 30 PERCENT FOR THE INTERSTATE 10 CORRIDOR FOR THE FIRST HALF OF TUESDAY MORNING AND THEN EXTENDED THE SCATTERED POPS NORTHWARD FOR THE LAST HALF OF THE MORNING. WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THE ACTIVITY BEGINS BEFORE SUNRISE...HOWEVER IF THE RAP13 IS ON TARGET...THE COVERAGE WILL BE ISOLATED WHICH IS CURRENTLY COVERED WITH THE 20 PERCENT POPS. WILL NEED TO MONITOR THE THREAT FOR LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. THE MODEL IS NOT INDICATING PW/S MUCH HIGHER THAN 1.6 INCHES AT THIS TIME...HOWEVER IF SLOW MOVING STORMS DEVELOP EVEN A 1 TO 2 INCH PER HOUR RAINFALL RATE WOULD POISE A PROBLEM.  UPDATED POPS AND WEATHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS EVENING AND THE TUESDAY MORNING TIME PERIODS.  40  
UPDATE... A COUPLE OF OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WERE MOVING SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. UPDATE TO ADD SLIGHTER BETTER CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE WEST-CENTRAL SET OF COUNTIES THROUGH THE REST OF THE EVENING. THE 23Z HRRR INITIALIZED WELL WITH THE CURRENT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THE MODELS THEN KEEPS AT LEAST ISOLATED CONVECTION GOING BETWEEN 9 PM AND MIDNIGHT.  40  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 650 PM CDT MON MAY 18 2015/  DISCUSSION... 00Z TAF DISCUSSION IN AVIATION SECTION...  AVIATION... VIS SATELLITE AND RADAR SHOW OUTFLOW BOUNDARY PUSHING INTO THE HOUSTON AREA FROM THE EAST. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME NEW STORMS TO DEVELOP BUT LOOKS LIKE MOISTURE/INSTABILITY MAY HAVE BEEN WORKED OVER JUST ENOUGH THAT THE STORMS ARE NOT AS STRONG AS THEY COULD BE OTHERWISE. STORMS ARE MAINLY IMPACTING KCXO BUT COULD SEE A FEW CONVECTIVE CELLS DEVELOP THROUGH THE EVENING AROUND KIAH/KUTS. MENTION VCTS FOR MOST TAF SITES UNTIL 02Z BUT AT LEAST TEMPO TSRA FOR CXO AND UTS.  TONIGHT EXPECT MAINLY MVFR CIGS TO DEVELOP AS HAS BEEN THE CASE THE LAST FEW NIGHTS. REMNANT OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MAY SET UP EAST/WEST ACROSS THE AREA. THINK LATEST RAP/HRRR SEEM TO HAVE A HANDLE ON THIS EVOLUTION. RAP ALSO DEVELOPS CONVECTION ALONG THIS BOUNDARY IN THE MORNING. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS SHORT WAVE TROUGH OVER MEXICO/W TX/BIG BEND AREA THAT COULD IMPACT THE AREA BY LATE MORNING. WITH DAYTIME HEATING DECIDED TO PUT VCTS IN TAFS STARTING 16Z WITH VCSH PRIOR TO THAT.  39  
ISSUE WILL BE WHETHER ANY CONVECTION GETS ACROSS THE RIO GRANDE OVERNIGHT. RADAR TRENDS ARE TO DEVELOP CONVECTION FARTHER WEST AND WEAKEN IT OVERNIGHT...SOME MAY CROSS THE RIVER BEFORE DISSIPATING. PREVIOUS FORECAST SEEMS TO HAVE THIS WELL IN HAND. FOR THE REST OF THE PACKAGE (ESPECIALLY TONIGHT) FORECAST IS DOING WELL. DID MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO WINDS AND SKY COVER HOWEVER...BASED ON CURRENT OBSERVATIONS AND SATELLITE DATA. PRODUCTS ARE OUT.  
ALTHOUGH OUTPUT IS GIVING 15 KNOTS. OBSERVATIONS ARE RUNNING AROUND 15 -19 KNOTS...SO MAY GO WITH SCEC SOME LOCATIONS AND THEN 15 KNOTS LATER TONIGHT.

SCATTERED SHRA/TSRA HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE EXTREME EASTERN AND NORTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. THESE STORMS HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF PRODUCING LOCALIZED FLOODING, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WITH AN ALREADY SATURATED GROUND. THE STORMS IN DEEP SE TEXAS ARE BEING ENHANCED BY A REMNANT OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MOVING W-SW. INTO THE EVENING, THE LOSS OF HEATING WILL DROP THE PRECIP CHANCES TO 20% OVERNIGHT. SUSTAINED ONSHORE FLOW OVER NEXT SEVERAL DAYS WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR SCATTERED SHRA/TSRA TO DEVELOP IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS WITH THE PASSAGE OF ANY SHORTWAVE TROUGH OR IN AREAS OF ENHANCED SURFACE CONVERGENCE.  EARLY WED MORNING...A SURFACE LOW WILL DEVELOP AS A MID LEVEL LOW EJECTS OUT OF THE ROCKIES. THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL PROGRESS INTO THE AREA WED NIGHT-THURS, INCREASING THE RAIN CHANCES THURSDAY.  THE EXTENDED FORECAST...FRIDAY, THE BOUNDARY WILL WEAKEN/MOVE NORTH, ALLOWING FOR SUSTAINED SE FLOW TO PROVIDE A MOISTURE SOURCE FOR SCATTERED SHRA/TSRA DEVELOPMENT OVER THE WEEKEND. TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEKEND, ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL EJECT OUT OF THE ROCKIES DEVELOPING ANOTHER SURFACE LOW AND COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY EARLY NEXT WEEK.  DSB  MARINE...  RELATIVELY QUIET CONDITIONS IN PLACE ACROSS THE MARINE AREAS THIS AFTERNOON... WITH A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS DEVELOPING OVER THE EASTERN WATERS. COULD SEE ADDITIONAL SHOWERS OR STORMS OVER THE COASTAL WATERS TONIGHT AS AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MOVES OUT OF LOUISIANA AND INTO THE GULF AS WELL AS OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES TRACK NEAR THE REGION... BUT CHANCES LOOK TO DIMINISH BY THE END OF THE WEEK AS AN UPPER RIDGE NOSES INTO THE REGION. A FRONTAL BOUNDARY SAGS TOWARDS SOUTHEAST TEXAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY... BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW THAT THIS FEATURE WILL REACH THE COASTAL WATERS WITH SURFACE PRESSURE RISES DECREASING BEHIND THE FRONT AS IT APPROACHES. CAN/T RULE OUT A MORE EASTERLY FETCH DEVELOPING IN RESPONSE WITH SOME SLIGHTLY ELEVATED TIDES DURING THIS TIME HOWEVER. LOOKING AHEAD TO THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND... ONSHORE FLOW INCREASES IN RESPONSE TO A DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW OVER THE HIGH PLAINS SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY. THIS WILL CONTINUE CONCERNS FOR RIP CURRENT RISKS ALONG THE COAST.  OTHERWISE...

ISOLATED TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE AGAIN DURING THE AFTERNOON FOR THE TERMINALS... WITH THE BEST CHANCES FOR TERMINALS ALONG AND SOUTH OF INTERSTATE 10 /KIAH...KSGR...KHOU...KLBX...AND KGLS/ AS THE ATMOSPHERE FARTHER NORTH HAS STABILIZED SOMEWHAT IN THE WAKE OF THIS MORNING/S ACTIVITY.

PLEASE CONTINUE TO STRESS THE TURN AROUND DOWN DROWN SLOGAN AS WE CONTINUE THE ABOVE NORMAL RAINFALL.  
EXPECTED TO SPREAD NORTH AND WEST THROUGH THE EVENING. THE THREE TERMINALS SHOULD SEE BKN-OVC MVFR CIGS BETWEEN 15-25K FEET BETWEEN 3-6Z AND PERSIST UNTIL 12-14Z. LOW LEVEL INVERSION TO BREAK AND DAY TIME HEATING TO HELP MIX OUT THE LOW LAYER MOISTURE WITH SCT- BKN VFR CONDITOINS REDEVELOPING AFTER 14Z TUESDAY. LIGHT TO MODERATE SOUTHEAST WINDS THIS EVENING BECOME GUSTY TUESDAY WITH GUSTS AROUND 25 KNOTS.  
SHORT TERM /NOW THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...A MODEST SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST H5 FLOW WILL LIE OVER MUCH OF TEXAS IN THE SHORT TERM... DOWNSTREAM OF MID LEVEL TROUGHING EDGING EAST FROM CALIFORNIA TOWARD THE GREAT BASIN AND FOUR CORNERS. WEAK H5 RIDGING WILL OCCUR OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE ANCHORED OVER THE NORTH AND WEST GULF. THE RESULT WILL BE A DRY FORECAST WITH WARM... SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES...THAT IS MID TO UPPER 70S AT NIGHT AND UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S DURING THE DAY. LIGHT TO MODERATE SOUTHEAST WINDS WILL CONTINUE...WITH A MIX OF CLOUDS AND SUN DURING THE DAY AND MARINE INVERSION LOW CLOUDS NEAR THE COAST AT NIGHT.  SOME CONVECTION WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE OVER THE SIERRA MADRES TONIGHT...AND TUESDAY NIGHT...WITH ISOLATED RADAR RETURNS NOW NEAR THE BIG BEND AND ALONG THE RANGE FARTHER SOUTH...BUT IN GENERAL WOULD EXPECT ANY CONVECTION TO MIND ITS MANNERS AND NOT GET TOO CLOSE. SURFACE DEW POINTS ARE STILL ELEVATED IN THE MID 70S...BUT DEEPER MOISTURE APPEARS MORE LIMITED THAN PREVIOUSLY WITH PWAT CLOSER TO 1.5 INCHES.  TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...AS THE MID LEVEL LOW PRESSURE MOVES NORTHEAST...A BACK DOOR FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTH OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. THE FRONT WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THE AREA...MAINLY HELPING TO TRIGGER CONVECTION OVER EAST TEXAS AND THE GULF COAST.  LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...BRIEF H5 RIDGE EXPECTED TO KEEP CONDITIONS CALM FOR ONE MORE DAY ON WEDNESDAY AS THE NEXT H5 TROUGH LINES UP ON TEXAS FOR THE WEEKEND. CONSISTENT TEMPERATURE REGIME REMAINS ON WEDNESDAY WITH HIGHS AGAIN REACHING AROUND 90. MODELS BECOMING MORE CONSISTENT ON CONVECTIVE FORMATION ON THURSDAY ON THE MOUNTAINS IN MEXICO MOVING NEWD INTO THE WESTERN CWA. POP CHANCES AGAIN FOCUSED ON AREAS WEST OF US281...WITH THE LOWER VALLEY IN THE MORE STABLE REGIME. THE MAIN CRUX OF THE WAVE WRAPPING AROUND THE H5 TROUGH MOVES THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING...WITH CONTINUED SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY FOR THE NORTHERN COUNTIES. SATURDAY WILL BE BETWEEN TWO LOBES...WITH WEAK AND BRIEF RIDGING CAPPING OFF THE VALLEY. THE NEXT SHORTWAVE LOBE WRAPS AROUND THE ADVANCING TROUGH LATE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING...WITH ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. MODELS KEEP THE RAIN CHANCES GOING THROUGH SUNDAY AND INTO THE FIRST OF NEXT WEEK AS THE H5 TROUGH OPENS UP AND SWEEPS ACROSS TEXAS.  MARINE... NOW THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS ANCHORED OVER THE CENTRAL GULF WITH LOWER PRESSURE INLAND. EXPECT MODERATE SOUTHEAST WINDS AND MODERATE SEAS THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. SMALL CRAFT SHOULD EXERCISE CAUTION CONDITIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE AT TIMES.  WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY....SOUTHEAST FLOW DOMINATES THE COASTAL WATERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED...REACHING AROUND 15 KNOTS EACH AFTERNOON. THIS WILL KEEP SEAS GENERALLY 3 TO 4 FEET THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK. WEEKEND FORECAST NOTES LOW PRESSURE DEEPENING IN COLORADO...WHICH WILL INCREASE WINDS AND SEAS...ESPECIALLY SUNDAY. CURRENT SEAS FORECAST REACH 6 TO 8 FEET ON SUNDAY...WHICH WOULD NECESSITATE ADVISORIES.  
CONVECTION CONTINUES IN THE REGION BUT SO FAR TAF SITES HAVE ESCAPED ANY ACTIVITY ON STATION AND WILL KEEP MENTION OUT OF TAFS. WACO AND ARLINGTON WOULD BE THE SITES WITH THE MOST POTENTIAL FOR CONVECTION DURING THE NEXT 2 HOURS AND WILL MONITOR RADAR TRENDS FOR UPDATES. CONVECTION SHOULD DIMINISH AFTER SUNSET...BUT HI-RES NAM IS INDICATING POTENTIAL FOR CONVECTION LATE TONIGHT WHICH IS TREATED AS AN OUTLIER FOR NOW.  WILL BRING MVFR/IFR STRATUS IN LATE TONIGHT...ALTHOUGH CONFIDENCE IN IFR IS NOT OVERLY HIGH GIVEN LOW SREF PROBABILITIES. HOWEVER WITH THE EASTERLY FLOW IN THE LOW LEVELS AND EXPECTED NEAR SURFACE SATURATION...FELT IT WAS BEST TO SHOW A TEMPO FOR IFR FROM 11-15Z. CIGS WILL LIFT DURING THE LATE MORNING HOURS WITH VFR EXPECTED BY EARLY AFTERNOON.  AN UNSTABLE AND UNCAPPED AIRMASS WILL EXIST OVER THE REGION TUESDAY. THE CONVECTIVE FORECAST BECOMES PROBLEMATIC AS MODEL GUIDANCE IS WILDLY VARYING ON TIMING AND COVERAGE. AM UNABLE TO PICK A MOST LIKELY WINDOW AT THIS TIME AND TO AVOID A LOW CONFIDENCE LENGTHY MENTION OF VCTS WILL OMIT IT FROM THE TAF AT THIS TIME...BUT IT MAY BE ADDED LATER.  TR.92    
THE ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN WILL CONTINUE ACROSS NORTH TEXAS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WITH SEVERAL ADDITIONAL CHANCES FOR RAIN AND THUNDERSTORMS AND CONTINUED FLOODING. THE UPPER LEVEL PATTERN CONTINUES TO FAVOR TROUGHING OVER THE WESTERN U.S. AND RIDGING TO THE EAST OF TEXAS. THIS WILL KEEP THE REGION IN AN ACTIVE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK.  ACROSS NORTH TEXAS THIS AFTERNOON...SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S AND DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 70S. THIS YIELDS SURFACE BASED CAPE OF AROUND 2500 J/KG WITH LITTLE INHIBITION. A LACK OF A STRONG FORCING MECHANISM SUGGESTS THAT CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING SHOULD BE PRIMARILY DIURNALLY DRIVEN AND WEAKEN AFTER SUNSET. DEEP LAYER SHEAR IS AROUND 35KTS BUT MOST OF THIS IS IN THE FORM OF STRONGER WINDS ABOVE 700MB. THE FLOW FROM THE SURFACE TO 700MB IS QUITE WEAK AND SURFACE WINDS ARE EAST-SOUTHEAST IN MANY AREAS. THESE OPPOSING WINDS FROM THE SURFACE THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE ATMOSPHERE SHOULD RESULT IN VERY SLOW MOVING CONVECTION WHICH COULD PRODUCE VERY LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINFALL THROUGH THE EVENING. THERE IS A LOW SEVERE WEATHER THREAT MAINLY IN THE FORM OF DAMAGING WINDS FROM COLLAPSING THUNDERSTORMS.  ONE SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL EJECT NORTHEAST THROUGH THE 4-CORNERS REGION OVERNIGHT. THIS WILL ALLOW CONVECTION ACROSS WEST TEXAS TO BECOME MORE ORGANIZED AND MOVE EAST. THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD WEAKEN AS IT CONTINUES EAST...ALTHOUGH THE LATEST GFS SEEMS TO BE SUFFERING FROM SOME SERIOUS CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK AND HANGS ON TO DEEP CONVECTION THROUGH TOMORROW MORNING ACROSS NORTH TEXAS. THE CURRENT FORECAST WONT BE QUITE SO BULLISH ON POPS OVERNIGHT INTO TUESDAY...HOWEVER...IF THE GFS HAS LATCHED ON TO MORE ROBUST FORCING FOR ASCENT...WE MAY HAVE TO RAISE POPS OVERNIGHT.  ON TUESDAY...RAIN CHANCES SHOULD INCREASE AS ANOTHER DISTURBANCE IN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT MOVES ACROSS THE AREA. THIS COINCIDES WITH A SURGE OF MID LEVEL MOISTURE WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BY LATE AFTERNOON...PRIMARILY WEST OF INTERSTATE 35.  ON WEDNESDAY AND WED NIGHT...A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTHWARD AND RAIN/STORM CHANCES SHOULD INCREASE. SOME SEVERE WEATHER WILL BE POSSIBLE DURING THIS TIME BUT THE MAIN THREAT WILL BE FLOODING FROM ADDITIONAL RAINFALL ON SATURATED SOILS. CONTINUED TROUGHING WILL PERSIST OVER THE SOUTHWEST U.S. THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK WITH ADDITIONAL RAIN CHANCES EACH DAY.  NOTE ABOUT FORECAST RAINFALL AMOUNTS AND RAINFALL GRAPHICS...  WITH THE HEAVY RAINFALL OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AND CONTINUED ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN...FORECAST RAINFALL AMOUNTS HAVE BECOME QUITE POPULAR FOR PLANNING PURPOSES. KEEP IN MIND THAT FORECAST RAINFALL AMOUNTS CAN VARY GREATLY OVER SHORT DISTANCES AND HAVE A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS BUILT IN. THESE PRECIPITATION FORECASTS ASSUME THAT THE OVERALL CONVECTIVE FORECAST IS CORRECT ALONG WITH THE LOCATION AND DURATION OF PRECIPITATION. MULTIPLE DAY PRECIPITATION FORECASTS ARE LIKELY TO INCLUDE MORE THAN ONE ROUND OF PRECIPITATION...AND IT SHOULD NOT BE ASSUMED THAT ALL OF THE PRECIPITATION WILL OCCUR AT ONCE.  OUR CURRENT FORECAST PRECIPITATION OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS HAS ANYWHERE FROM AROUND 1 INCH IN OUR SOUTHEAST TO OVER 2 INCHES IN OUR NORTHWEST COUNTIES THROUGH MID WEEK. ANY OF THESE SCATTERED DIURNAL SHOWERS AND STORMS CAN PUT DOWN CONSIDERABLY MORE PRECIPITATION OVER A SHORT DURATION.  DUNN  
MVFR CIGS TO DEVELOP IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS. WILL KEEP A MAINLY MVFR CIG OVERNIGHT...BUT COULD OCCASIONALLY DROP TO JUST INTO IFR RANGE. MAY SEE SHOWERS/STORMS FOR LRD FOR A TIME OVERNIGHT...BUT NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO INCLUDE IN TAF YET. MAY NEED TO UPDATE IF CONVECTION OVER MEXICO APPROACHES. CIGS IMPROVE TOMORROW WITH A MODERATE SOUTHEAST WIND CONTINUING.  
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...SHORT TERM FORECAST FEATURES MOSTLY A BRIEF AND NEEDED BREAK FROM PRECIPITATION AS SOUTH TEXAS SEES WEAK RIDGING AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT. ONLY EXCEPTION HERE IS THAT CONVECTION MAY FIRE OFF THE SIERRA MADRES TO OUR WEST. SHOULD THAT OCCUR...THERE IS A SMALL CHANCE THAT A FEW OF THOSE MAY MEANDER ACROSS THE RIVER INTO OUR FAR WESTERN COUNTIES. OTHER THAN THE ABOVE...EXPECT WARM AND HUMID CONDITIONS WITH BREEZY AFTERNOONS.  LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...SHORTWAVE RIDGING WILL BE OVER SOUTH TEXAS TO BEGIN THE EXTENDED PART OF THE FORECAST. THIS WILL RESULT IN KEEPING MUCH OF THE AREA DRY WEDNESDAY...BUT LOW POPS WERE RETAINED OVER THE NORTHWEST AREAS. MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE A FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE CENTRAL OR NORTH CENTRAL PART OF THE STATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR AN MCS TO DEVELOP WEDNESDAY NIGHT TO THE NORTHWEST...WITH CONVECTION APPROACHING THE NORTHWEST AND WESTERN AREAS IF COMPLEX HOLDS TOGETHER. REMNANT BOUNDARIES AND APPROACHING SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL LEAD TO DECENT CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND STORMS ON THURSDAY AND WILL KEEP POPS IN THE 40 TO 50 PERCENT RANGE. SHORTWAVE TROUGH PASSES TO THE EAST ON FRIDAY WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO SLIGHTLY LOWER CHANCES OF RAIN. AN ACTIVE PATTERN PERSIST INTO THE WEEKEND AS NEXT LONGWAVE TROUGH ORGANIZES OVER THE WESTERN CONUS THEN SLOWLY SHIFTS TO THE EAST. SEVERAL DISTURBANCES EMBEDDED IN SW FLOW ALOFT WILL TRAVERSE THE AREA AND INTERACT WITH SUFFICIENT MOISTURE. SEVERAL ROUNDS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE DURING THIS TIME. SUNDAY LOOKS TO BE THE MOST FAVORABLE TIME FOR RAINFALL AND WILL HAVE TO MONITOR FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN. TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE EXTENDED WONT VARY TOO MUCH...WITH LOWER 90S OUT WEST WITH 80S ACROSS THE REST OF THE AREA.  
00Z TAF DISCUSSION IN AVIATION SECTION...  
VIS SATELLITE AND RADAR SHOW OUTFLOW BOUNDARY PUSHING INTO THE HOUSTON AREA FROM THE EAST. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME NEW STORMS TO DEVELOP BUT LOOKS LIKE MOISTURE/INSTABILITY MAY HAVE BEEN WORKED OVER JUST ENOUGH THAT THE STORMS ARE NOT AS STRONG AS THEY COULD BE OTHERWISE. STORMS ARE MAINLY IMPACTING KCXO BUT COULD SEE A FEW CONVECTIVE CELLS DEVELOP THROUGH THE EVENING AROUND KIAH/KUTS. MENTION VCTS FOR MOST TAF SITES UNTIL 02Z BUT AT LEAST TEMPO TSRA FOR CXO AND UTS.  TONIGHT EXPECT MAINLY MVFR CIGS TO DEVELOP AS HAS BEEN THE CASE THE LAST FEW NIGHTS. REMNANT OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MAY SET UP EAST/WEST ACROSS THE AREA. THINK LATEST RAP/HRRR SEEM TO HAVE A HANDLE ON THIS EVOLUTION. RAP ALSO DEVELOPS CONVECTION ALONG THIS BOUNDARY IN THE MORNING. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS SHORT WAVE TROUGH OVER MEXICO/W TX/BIG BEND AREA THAT COULD IMPACT THE AREA BY LATE MORNING. WITH DAYTIME HEATING DECIDED TO PUT VCTS IN TAFS STARTING 16Z WITH VCSH PRIOR TO THAT.  39  
DISCUSSION... SCATTERED SHRA/TSRA HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE EXTREME EASTERN AND NORTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. THESE STORMS HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF PRODUCING LOCALIZED FLOODING, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WITH AN ALREADY SATURATED GROUND. THE STORMS IN DEEP SE TEXAS ARE BEING ENHANCED BY A REMNANT OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MOVING W-SW. INTO THE EVENING, THE LOSS OF HEATING WILL DROP THE PRECIP CHANCES TO 20% OVERNIGHT. SUSTAINED ONSHORE FLOW OVER NEXT SEVERAL DAYS WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR SCATTERED SHRA/TSRA TO DEVELOP IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS WITH THE PASSAGE OF ANY SHORTWAVE TROUGH OR IN AREAS OF ENHANCED SURFACE CONVERGENCE.  EARLY WED MORNING...A SURFACE LOW WILL DEVELOP AS A MID LEVEL LOW EJECTS OUT OF THE ROCKIES. THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL PROGRESS INTO THE AREA WED NIGHT-THURS, INCREASING THE RAIN CHANCES THURSDAY.  THE EXTENDED FORECAST...FRIDAY, THE BOUNDARY WILL WEAKEN/MOVE NORTH, ALLOWING FOR SUSTAINED SE FLOW TO PROVIDE A MOISTURE SOURCE FOR SCATTERED SHRA/TSRA DEVELOPMENT OVER THE WEEKEND. TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEKEND, ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL EJECT OUT OF THE ROCKIES DEVELOPING ANOTHER SURFACE LOW AND COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY EARLY NEXT WEEK.  DSB  MARINE...  RELATIVELY QUIET CONDITIONS IN PLACE ACROSS THE MARINE AREAS THIS AFTERNOON... WITH A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS DEVELOPING OVER THE EASTERN WATERS. COULD SEE ADDITIONAL SHOWERS OR STORMS OVER THE COASTAL WATERS TONIGHT AS AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MOVES OUT OF LOUISIANA AND INTO THE GULF AS WELL AS OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES TRACK NEAR THE REGION... BUT CHANCES LOOK TO DIMINISH BY THE END OF THE WEEK AS AN UPPER RIDGE NOSES INTO THE REGION. A FRONTAL BOUNDARY SAGS TOWARDS SOUTHEAST TEXAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY... BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW THAT THIS FEATURE WILL REACH THE COASTAL WATERS WITH SURFACE PRESSURE RISES DECREASING BEHIND THE FRONT AS IT APPROACHES. CAN/T RULE OUT A MORE EASTERLY FETCH DEVELOPING IN RESPONSE WITH SOME SLIGHTLY ELEVATED TIDES DURING THIS TIME HOWEVER. LOOKING AHEAD TO THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND... ONSHORE FLOW INCREASES IN RESPONSE TO A DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW OVER THE HIGH PLAINS SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY. THIS WILL CONTINUE CONCERNS FOR RIP CURRENT RISKS ALONG THE COAST.  OTHERWISE... LIGHT TO OCCASIONALLY MODERATE ONSHORE FLOW EXPECTED TO PERSIST OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS... WITH SEAS GENERALLY 2 TO 4 FEET.  HUFFMAN  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1256 PM CDT MON MAY 18 2015/  AVIATION... FOR THE 18Z TAFS... MORNING STORMS HAVE CLEARED THE TERMINALS BUT REMNANT CLOUD DEBRIS IS DOING LITTLE TO SUPPRESS HEATING WITH MANY SITES APPROACHING CONVECTIVE TEMPERATURES. ISOLATED TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE AGAIN DURING THE AFTERNOON FOR THE TERMINALS... WITH THE BEST CHANCES FOR TERMINALS ALONG AND SOUTH OF INTERSTATE 10 /KIAH...KSGR...KHOU...KLBX...AND KGLS/ AS THE ATMOSPHERE FARTHER NORTH HAS STABILIZED SOMEWHAT IN THE WAKE OF THIS MORNING/S ACTIVITY. OTHERWISE... VFR CONDITIONS THIS AFTERNOON EXPECTED TO DETERIORATE TO MVFR TONIGHT AS CEILINGS LOWER WITH SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS BECOMING LIGHT AND VARIABLE. COULD SEE SOME PATCHY OVERNIGHT FOG AS WELL... BUT ONLY HIGHLIGHTING CATEGORY CHANGES FOR VISIBILITIES AT KCXO AND KUTS FOR NOW.  HUFFMAN  
ONSET OF CONVECTION AT TERMINALS WILL BE MAIN UNCERTAINTY THIS TAF CYCLE. ISOLD STORMS SW OF KLBB WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE NE IMPACTING TERMINAL BY 02Z ON CURRENT TRACK. INCREASED COVERAGE EXPECTED FROM SW THIS EVENING BEFORE MORE WIDESPREAD ACTIVITY DEVELOPS OVERNIGHT AS LARGE SCALE TROUGH ENTERS THE PICTURE. SOLID...DEEP MOISTURE TRANSPORT INTO THE AREA WITH UPSLOPE FLOW WILL BREED IFR CIGS ALL SITES AFT 06Z. LIFR VSBY/CIGS POSSIBLE WITH CONVECTIVE BANDS THROUGH 15Z BEFORE LIFT BEGINS TO DEPART WITH SLOWLY IMPROVING FLIGHT CONDITIONS AFT 18Z TUE.  
SHORT TERM...  
FLOOD WATCH FROM MIDNIGHT CDT TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON FOR TXZ033>044.  
MODERATE TO STRONG EASTERLY UPSLOPE FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO DRAW LOW- LEVEL MOISTURE INTO THE FORECAST AREA.  BY 05Z TUESDAY...EXPECT MVFR CEILINGS TO DEVELOP.  RAPID DETERIORATION OF FLIGHT CATEGORIES EXPECTED TO FOLLOW WITH WITH ALL TERMINALS LOWERING TO IFR CEILINGS BY 09Z TUESDAY.  THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED AT ALL TERMINALS AFTER 07Z TUESDAY WITH OCCASIONAL LIFR CONDITIONS LIKELY.  THESE POOR FLYING CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO PERSIST THROUGH THE DAY ON TUESDAY.  COCKRELL  
DISCUSSION...  AN ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD WITH SEVERAL CHANCES FOR RAIN. CHALLENGES FOR THIS FORECAST INCLUDE HEAVY RAIN/FLOODING POTENTIAL...FRONTAL POSITION...TEMPERATURES...AND POSSIBILE WINDOW FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPEMENT. THESE UNCERTAINTIES ARE LARGELY A RESULT OF SUBTLE DIFFERENCES WITH FLOW PATTERN ALOFT AND REFLECTION AT THE SURFACE. IN THE NEAR TERM...CONFIDENCE IS HIGH ON YET ANOTHER WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION EVENT TONIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST EARLY TOMORROW. THIS EVENT SHOULD BE FAIRLY LOW IMPACT IN THE ABSCENCE OF SIGNIFICANT INSTABILITY ALTHOUGH SATURATED SOILS PARTICULARLY IN THE EAST RAISES SOME CONCERN FOR MINOR FLOODING. EVEN AN INCH OR TWO IN A 36 HOUR PERIOD MAY BE ENOUGH FOR SOME FLOOD CONCERNS.  PRESSURE ADVECTION AND SATURATION ON ISENTROPIC SURFACES MAXIMIZE FOR A PERIOD BEGINNING EARLY TONIGHT IN THE WEST AND SPREADING EAST THROUGH THE NIGHT. THE BULK OF THIS SHOULD MOVE EAST OF THE AREA BY LATE MORNING OR EARLY AFTERNOON. PWAT VALUES OF AROUND THE 99TH PERCENTILE SUGGEST POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAINFALL BUT PROGRESSIVE NATURE SHOULD LIMIT A MORE SIGNIFICANT FLOOD CONCERN. THE PLAN IS TO HOLD OFF ON A FLOOD WATCH AND HANDLE THIS EVENT WITH FLOOD ADVISORIES WHERE NECESSARY AS THE EVENT UNFOLDS THROUGH THE NIGHT AND INTO TOMORROW MORNING.  MEANWHILE THE SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL DEAMPLIFY/WEAKEN WITH RESIDUAL 50-60 KNOT 500 MB SPEED MAX OVERSPREADING THE AREA BY AFTERNOON. THIS IS WHEN SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES EMERGE. MODELS HAVE STRUGGLED WITH MESOSCALE DETAILS AS OF LATE WHEN OVERNIGHT CONVECTION IS EXTENSIVE THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND TOMORROW WILL PROBABLY BE NO EXCEPTION. MEAN FLOW ORIENTATION AND MAGNITUDE WOULD GENERALLY FAVOR AN EASTWARD MIXING DRYLINE ALTHOUGH WITH DOWNWARD TRENDS IN MOMENTUM BY PEAK MIXING AND FAIRLY DEEP LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THE DRYLINE TO SHARPEN SIGNIFICANTLY AND MIX TOO FAR EAST. THERE IS SOME QUESTION ON THE LEVEL OF DESTABILIZIATION THAT CAN OCCUR DURING THE AFTERNOON. CURRENT THINKING IS THAT IN THE WAKE OF WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION SOME DIABATIC HEATING AND POCKETS OF AT LEAST MODEST INSTABILITY SHOULD FORM BY MID AFTERNOON. SCATTERED CONVECTION SHOULD GRADUALLY INCREASE IN INTENSITY AND POSE A MARGINAL SEVERE WEATHER THREAT DURING THE AFTERNOON GIVEN SUFFICIENT DEEP LAYER SHEAR AND BACKED LOW LEVEL WINDS. MOST MODELS SHOW A LOW LEVEL THETA-E AXIS EXTENDING NORTHWESTWARD ACROSS ROUGHLY THE SOUTHWESTERN HALF OF THE TEXAS PANHANDLE AND THIS MAY BE COINCIDENT WITH THE MOST INTENSE CONVECTION DURING THE AFTERNOON. ALL OF THIS WILL DEPEND ON DIFFICULT TO RESOLVE MESOSCALE FEATURES/BOUNDARIES THAT WILL STRONGLY BE TIED TO OVERNIGHT/EARLY MORNING CONVECTION. A MORE CONFIDENT FORECAST WILL REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF OBSERVATIONAL TRENDS LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY TOMORROW MORNING.  SOME OF THE GUIDANCE IS SLIGHTLY MORE PERTURBED WITH MEAN SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW INTO WEDNESDAY AND THEREBY MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH A SOUTHWARD INTRUSION OF COOL/DRY AIR MASS INTO AT LEAST THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE AREA. GFS IS THE OUTLIER AND LESS AGRESSIVE WITH SOUTHWARD MOVEMENT OF THE COLD FRONT. HAVE SIDED WITH THE HIGHER RESOLUTION NAM AND WRF AND THE SREF AND ECMWF FOR FRONTAL TIMING...WINDS AND TEMPERATURES. WE HAVE CONSIERABLY COOLER TEMPERATURES THAN MOST STATISTICAL GUIDANCE FOR WEDNESDAY. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW DRY SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT ABOVE MOIST NORTHEASTERLY/EASTERLY LOW LEVELS. GIVEN STEADY HEIGHT RISES AND SIGNS OF CAPPING INVERSION AT THE TOP OF THE MOIST LOW LEVELS IN FORECAST SOUNDINGS BELIEVE PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION IS QUITE LOW. DEPENDING ON HOW THIS EVOLVES THERE IS SOME POTENTIAL FOR MOIST UPSLOPE AND COOLER AIR MASS TO RESULT IN PERSISTIENT LOW CLOUDS AND FOG THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY ON WEDESDAY.  BY THURSDAY EVENING A LEAD SHORTWAVE APPROACHES AND HEIGHT FALLS OCCUR SO RETAINED LOW PRECIPITATION PROBABITLIES. THE MAGNITUDE OF ASCENT AND PRESENCE OF ANOMALOUS MOISTURE JUSTIFIES RELATIVELY HIGH PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES FOR THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING. AS THE MAIN UPPER LOW EJECTS NORTHEASTWARD FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY THERE WILL LIKELY BE ANOTHER PERIOD OF PRECIPITATION. CONTINUED MOIST SOUTHEASTERLY LOW LEVEL TRAJECTORIES AND PWAT VALUES OVER ONE INCH (POSSIBLY AGAIN REACHING OR EXCEEDING THE 75TH PERCENTILE) RAISES CONCERN FOR FLOODING. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR TWO SUCCESSIVE WAVES OF PRECIPITATION (POTENTIALLY HEAVY) IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME...ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND AGAIN FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY. TIMING/PLACEMENT OF EACH ROUND OF PRECIPITATION IN THE EXTENDED REMAINS UNCERTAIN GIVEN TYPICAL INCREASED SPREAD IN THE ENSEMBLES AND UNRESOLVED SMALLER SCALE DETAILS.  BRB  
/00Z TAFS/ Mainly VFR conditions are expected through much of this evening. Widespread stratus will spread north across West Central Texas late tonight through much of Tuesday, with MVFR/IFR ceilings at the terminals. Also, a few storms are possible this evening along the I-10 corridor, and will add a VCTS to the KSOA terminal. Also, a complex of storms will probably move across the Big Country Tuesday morning and early afternoon and gone with 5SM -TSRA and the KABI terminal between 12Z and 15Z.  
SHORT TERM... (Tonight and Tuesday)  
FLASH FLOOD WATCH from Midnight CDT tonight through Tuesday evening FOR THE FOLLOWING ZONES: Callahan...Coke...Fisher... Haskell...Jones...Nolan...Runnels...Shackelford...Sterling... Taylor...Throckmorton.  
See 00Z Aviation Discussion below.  
Satellite imagery shows a very unstable AMS in place, w/strong return flow advecting moisture into the region. Area radars show convection going up along the Pecos River, producing mainly large hail/+SHRA. This activity is expected to develop east over the next few hrs, w/all terminals exposed. Forecast soundings develop a few hrs of LIFR cigs KMAF/KCNM/KHOB/KINK, and MVFR KFST/KPEQ, near sunrise.  
DISCUSSION... AN ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND AS A SERIES OF UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES MOVE ACROSS THE AREA.  IN THE SHORT TERM, OF PRIMARY CONCERN WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR EXCESSIVE RAINFALL AND SEVERE WEATHER ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO AND SOUTHWEST TEXAS.  THIS AFTERNOON, A GENERALLY SOUTHEAST FLOW WAS INCREASING MOISTURE EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS WITH DEWPOINTS EXCEEDING 60 DEGREES PUSHING THROUGH THE PECOS RIVER VALLEY AND INTO THE SOUTHERN PERMIAN BASIN. COMBINED WITH ABUNDANT INSOLATION AND COOLING ALOFT, CAPE VALUES ARE EXCEEDING 3000 THIS AFTERNOON. DAYTIME HEATING AND UPSLOPE FLOW WILL BRING INITIAL CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT PRIMARILY IN THE DAVIS MOUNTAINS AREA THIS AFTERNOON. WITH MODERATE SHEAR OF 40 KNOTS, DEVELOPMENT OF SUPERCELLS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WIND IS POSSIBLE. LFC LEVELS LESS THAN 2000M SUGGEST THAT ISOLATED TORNADIC DEVELOPMENT ALSO POSSIBLE LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING MAINLY WEST OF THE PECOS RIVER.  AS STORMS MOVE OFF THE HIGHER TERRAIN TOWARD THE NORTHEAST, LOOKING FOR MERGING OF CELLS INTO A LARGER-SCALE COMPLEX AIDED BY DEVELOPMENT OF A SOUTHEASTERLY LOW LEVEL JET THIS EVENING WHICH WILL SUSTAIN INSTABILITY ACROSS THE AREA. HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS WILL REMAIN POSSIBLE AS THE SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE PERMIAN BASIN. A SECONDARY WAVE OF THUNDERSTORMS IS EXPECTED AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES THE AREA LATE TONIGHT. WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER PROGGED OVER 1.5 INCHES ACROSS MUCH OF THE PERMIAN BASIN, HEAVY AND POTENTIALLY EXCESSIVE RAINFALL IS POSSIBLE MAINLY OVER THE CENTRAL TO NORTHERN PERMIAN BASIN. PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED EXIT EASTERN PARTS OF THE PERMIAN BASIN BY MID-DAY TUESDAY. A FLASH FLOOD WATCH WILL BE ISSUED FOR SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO, THE UPPER TRANS-PECOS AND THE PERMIAN BASIN FOR THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH MID-DAY TUESDAY.  AS DRIER AIR MIXES EAST TUESDAY, THE DRYLINE IS EXPECTED TO SET UP NEAR THE TEXAS/NEW MEXICO BORDER TUESDAY AFTERNOON. UNSTABLE CONDITIONS AND MODERATE SHEAR SUGGEST THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE WEATHER ALONG AND EAST OF THE DRYLINE, THOUGH DEVELOPMENT MAY BE INHIBITED IN THE WAKE OF DEPARTING SHORTWAVE AND MCS.  A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH INTO THE AREA WEDNESDAY, BRINGING CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS AGAIN MOSTLY TO EASTERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA, WHERE INSTABILITY WILL BE GREATEST. A MOIST RETURN FLOW AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM WILL FUEL DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY.  
LONG TERM FORECAST REMAINS ON TRACK FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF CLOUDY SKIES...COOLER THAN NORMAL TEMPS AND SEVERAL ROUNDS OF STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WITH PERIODS OF HEAVY RAINFALL THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  TUESDAY OVERNIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY WILL FEATURE WIDESPREAD RAINFALL FROM EARLIER IN THE DAY TUESDAY BEGINNING TO TAPER OFF AS THE FIRST WAVE EXITS NORTHEAST WHILE SWEEPING A COLD FRONT SOUTH THROUGH THE TEXAS PANHANDLE THROUGH EARLY MORNING HOURS AND THE SOUTH/ROLLING PLAINS BY EARLY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. COOLER AIR BEHIND THE FRONT WILL HELP LIMIT INSTABILITY SOMEWHAT LESSENING THE POTENTIAL FOR THUNDERSTORMS LATER IN THE AFTERNOON/EVENING REACHING SEVERE LEVELS...BUT GIVEN PWATS STEADILY REMAINING BETWEEN 1.0 AND 1.5 INCHES WITH STEEP LAPSE RATES AND DECENT ELEVATED CAPE CANNOT RULE OUT SOME MARGINALLY SEVERE HAIL OR WIND GUSTS WITH STRONGEST STORMS ESPECIALLY ALONG THE RETREATING DRYLINE.  SOUTHEAST UPSLOPE SURFACE FLOW RETURNS OVERNIGHT WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY AS THE UPPER LEVEL LOW APPROACHES FROM THE WEST. DEEP BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE WILL BACK THE DRYLINE UP AGAINST THE MOUNTAINS IN NEW MEXICO AS BAROCLINIC INSTABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH STRONG WAVE LEADS TO ENHANCED ISENTROPIC LIFT ACROSS EASTERN NEW MEXICO. WIDE SPREAD RAIN WITH EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS WILL PROGRESSIVELY MIGRATE OUT OF NEW MEXICO INTO WEST TEXAS THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND NIGHT ON THURSDAY.  AS THE UA LOW MARCHES NORTHEAST FOR FRIDAY WE WILL SEE MORE CLASSIC DRYLINE CONVECTION AND A TRIPLE POINT ALIGNED ACROSS THE SOUTH PLAINS AND TEXAS/NEW MEXICO BORDER. THIS WOULD ENHANCE SEVERE POTENTIAL ESPECIALLY IF MORE HEATING IS ALLOWED THAN CURRENTLY PROGGED. FOCUS FOR THE WEEKEND SHIFTS EAST SLIGHTLY TO THE ROLLING PLAINS AS THE SYSTEM SLOWLY PROGRESSES NORTHEAST. STRONG TO SEVERE TSTORMS WITH MORE HEAVY RAIN CANT BE RULED OUT IN OUR AREA OVER THE WEEKEND BUT SHOULD BE MORE FOCUSED ON THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA.  WORTH NOTING THAT WPC GUIDANCE HAS A LARGE SWATH OF 5 INCHES TO 7 INCHES OF RAIN BY THIS TIME NEXT WEEK WHICH WOULD BREAK THE ALL TIME RECORD FOR MAY RAINFALL SET IN 1941 WITH MORE THAN A WEEK LEFT IN MAY 2015. WITH MODELS HINTING TOWARD ANOTHER LARGE TROUGH/UA FOR NEXT WEEK...PUTTING THE ALL TIME RAINFALL RECORD FOR ANY GIVEN MONTH 
AN ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD WITH SEVERAL CHANCES FOR RAIN. CHALLENGES FOR THIS FORECAST INCLUDE HEAVY RAIN/FLOODING POTENTIAL...FRONTAL POSITION...TEMPERATURES...AND POSSIBILE WINDOW FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPEMENT.

SCATTERED SHRA/TSRA HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE EXTREME EASTERN AND NORTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. THESE STORMS HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF PRODUCING LOCALIZED FLOODING, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WITH AN ALREADY SATURATED GROUND. THE STORMS IN DEEP SE TEXAS ARE BEING ENHANCED BY A REMNANT OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MOVING W-SW. INTO THE EVENING, THE LOSS OF HEATING WILL DROP THE PRECIP CHANCES TO 20% OVERNIGHT.

(Tonight and Tuesday)  
(Tuesday night through Monday)  The forecast in a nutshell: It`s not going to rain every day at any particular location, but we are looking at several rounds of potentially heavy rainfall over the next week. Localized rainfall amounts exceeding 5 inches are not out of the question. However, where the heaviest rainfall occurs will be dependent on the location of certain mesoscale features. Numerical guidance will likely have a poor handle on the mesoscale features further out in time, so there will be plenty of forecast fine-tuning that needs to be done over the coming days. Overall, the severe weather threat is relatively low, but flash flooding will be a significant concern. Now let`s drill down for some details.  Southwest flow aloft will be the theme this week, as has been the case for most of the month of May. As we begin the long-term portion of the forecast (Tuesday night), a potent shortwave trough will be lifting northeast across the southern Plains. Convection will be possible overnight, especially across the Big Country/Heartland counties, but the strongest lift will be moving east and should limit the amount of precipitation.  A cold front is forecast to dip south into West Central TX on Wednesday into Wednesday evening. There remains some disagreement within the 12z model suite regarding how quickly this boundary moves south into the area. The GFS is notably slower, bringing the front south of I-20 by midday Thursday, a good 12-18 hours slower than the NAM, GEM, and ECMWF. The thinking is that with convection along/north of the boundary, the front will move south more quickly, more in line with the faster solutions. This presence of this front will be a player in the potential for heavy rainfall again on Wednesday afternoon and evening. Precipitable water values are progged to be in the 1.3 to 1.6" range by this time, providing ample moisture for convective development. Winds at 850 mb are forecast to remain from the south at near 15 mph, maintaining the fetch of moisture from the Gulf.  Additional model differences arise on Thursday. The NAM and ECMWF dry out the boundary layer quite a bit more than the GFS, which maintains dewpoints in the mid/upper 60s. Regardless, Thursday is likely to be a relative lull in precipitation as short-wave ridging aloft traverses the area. By Thursday night and Friday, however, the models are indicating another shortwave trough lifting northeast across Far West TX, providing additional synoptic scale ascent over the region. This lift, combined with the presence of the decaying frontal boundary, will likely aid in additional rainfall.  This pattern will persist through the weekend, keeping at least chance PoPs in the forecast areawide. A strong shortwave trough is forecast to lift northeast across West TX over the weekend. This will provide another shot at heavy rainfall and stronger thunderstorms. Temperatures will run near to slightly below normal for much of the period with highs in the mid 70s to lower 80s and overnight lows generally in the 60s.  Johnson  
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP MAINLY EAST OF THE RIO GRANDE LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND ESPECIALLY EARLY THIS EVENING...AS A WEAK UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE MOVES THROUGH THE REGION.  DRY...SEASONABLY WARM AND BREEZY WEATHER WILL OTHERWISE CONTINUE FOR THE WORK WEEK...WHILE ANOTHER TROUGH SWINGS NORTHEAST THROUGH THE REGION LATER IN THE WEEK. THIS MAY RETURN STORM CHANCES BACK EAST OF THE RIO GRANDE THURSDAY AND POSSIBLY FRIDAY.  
SFC WINDS ACROSS OUR CWFA SHIFTED SOUTHEAST THIS MORNING...AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING UPPER LEVEL WAVE INTO THE REGION. MOISTURE IS MAINLY IN THE MID LEVELS...AS DEW POINTS HAVE REMAINED DRY AND RELATIVELY UNCHANGED.  THE WAVE IS ONE OF TWO SHORTWAVE FEATURES ROTATING AROUND A LARGE UPPER LEVEL LOW NOW MOVING INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...AS EVIDENCED BY THE LATEST WATER VAPOR IMAGERY. A NICE SPLIT FLOW IN ITS SUPPORTIVE JET REMAINS EVIDENT OVER NORTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA. WITH AN ACTIVE ST JET MAKING UP THE SOUTHERN BRANCH...PAIR CONTINUES TO SUPPORT HEALTHY AREA OF DIFFLUENCE IMMEDIATELY DOWNSTREAM OVER NM AND MUCH OF THE FOUR CORNERS.  GFS AND ECMWF MOVE ATTENDANT S/WV TO THE LOW QUICKLY NE THROUGH OUR AREA OVERNIGHT...WHILE LIFTING PARENT LOW NE OVER 4-CORNERS AND WEAKENING IT OVER THE SOUTHERN ROCKIES / WYOMING BY LATER TUESDAY. LARGE AND COMPLEX UPPER LEVEL TROUGHING PATTERN WILL REMAIN UPSTREAM JUST OFF THE WEST COAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WITH ANOTHER LARGE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM EXPECTED OVER SO CAL LATER IN THE WEEK. REINFORCED PAC JET ENERGY WILL DEVELOP A SHORT WAVE ON THIS FEATURE...WHICH WILL QUICKLY EJECT AGAIN NE OVER NM AND W TX THURSDAY. APPROACH OF THE WAVE UNDER OTHERWISE SUSTAINED MODERATE SW FLOW ALOFT...WILL ENHANCE SFC TROUGHING IN LEE OF SIERRA MADRES...WHICH WILL HELP DRAW GULF MOISTURE BACK CLOSER TO OUR AREA THU AFTERNOON. MEANWHILE...STRONG BACK DOOR COOL FRONT REMAINS FORECAST INTO EASTERN NM AT THAT TIME.  LOW LATER IN WEEK IS EXPECTED TO MOVE INTO THE FOUR CORNERS BY THE WEEKEND...SUSTAINING SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AND SOUTHWEST WINDS FOR US.  WHILE SEASONABLY WARM WEATHER WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE WEEK...A PACIFIC COOL FRONT REMAINS FORECAST THROUGH OUR AREA LATER IN THE WEEKEND FROM THE LOW. THUS WE MAY SEE HIGHS FALL A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL SUNDAY FOR THE BORDERLAND.   IMPACTS LATER THIS AFTERNOON/EARLY TONIGHT: ISOLATED WIND GUSTS TO 50-60 MPH...LARGE HAIL AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN EAST OF THE RIO GRANDE. APPCH OF MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE NOW OVER WESTERN SONORA MX... WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE ROBUST DIFFLUENCE ALOFT OVER OUR AREA. MEANWHILE ATTENDANT SFC TROUGHING IN LEE OF SIERRA MADRES WILL HELP BRING MORE GULF MOISTURE OUR WAY...MAXIMIZED NEAR 600-650 MB. SE COMPONENT CONTRIBUTION TO OVERALL DIRECTIONAL SHEAR IS DIMINISHING THIS EVENING...AS FCST SOUNDINGS SUGGEST LL WINDS TO VEER SLY AFT MIDNIGHT. NEG LI`S AND CAPES ROUGHLY 300-800 J/KG REMAIN CONFINED TO EASTERN OTERO AND HUDSPETH COUNTIES. 0-6KM SHEAR 50-60 KTS ALSO NOTED IN THIS AREA. WHILE LARGER DYNAMICS ARE IN PLACE..THERMODYNAMIC PARMS ARE WEAK. THUS IT WILL TAKE THE NORMAL NIGHT TIME DRYLINE SURGE WITH OUTFLOWS...TO START CONVECTION FURTHER WEST INTO CENTRAL OTERO AND WESTERN HUDSPETH COUNTIES. LARGER UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS WILL TAKE CARE OF THE REST TO SUSTAIN ANY STRONGER STORMS. SINCE MOISTURE LEVELS ARE STARTING HIGH...STRONGER DOWNDRAFTS WILL BE FAVORED.  IMPACTS THURSDAY/THU NIGHT AND POSSIBLY FRIDAY: ISOLATED WIND GUSTS TO 50-60 MPH...LARGE HAIL AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN MAINLY EAST OF THE RIO GRANDE. SIMILAR SCENARIO AND MECHANISMS WITH THE SECOND SHORT WAVE...FOLLOWING A SIMILAR PATH NE OVER OUR AREA. MARGINAL INSTABILITY PARAMETERS LOOK TO BE THE CAST RIGHT NOW...THUS HAVE MAINTAINED WITH PREVIOUS FCST IN KEEPING SLT STORM CHANCES EASTERN AREAS. EXTENT OF BACK DOOR COOL FRONTAL PROPAGATION WILL NEED TO BE WATCHED...AS EFFECTS COULD COMBINE WITH DRYLINE FOR ENHANCED LL LIFT AND MOVEMENT FURTHER WESTWARD INTO OUR AREA THURS NIGHT.  IMPACTS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY: WINDY CONDITIONS POSSIBLE EACH AFTERNOON. WITH EFFECTS OF THE SHORT WAVE AND ANCHOR LOW TO FOLLOW AT THAT TIME...STRENGTHENED WINDS ALOFT AND RESULTANT ENHANCEMENT OF LEE TROUGH OVER NM/W TX MAY RESULT DEVELOPMENT STRONG SOUTHWEST WINDS FOR MOST AREAS. STRENGTH FROM MOMENTUM MIX DOWN WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON HIGH CLOUD COVER.   
P6SM SKC-SCT090-120 THRU PD. ISOLD 3-5SM TSRA BKN050-070 OVR SAC MTS AFT 18Z. LT WINDS UNDER 10KTS THRU 18Z BECOMING S TO SW 10-15G25KTS.   
A COUPLE MORE UPPER LOWS WILL BE MOVING THROUGH SOUTHERN CA AND INTO CENTRAL ROCKIES OVER THE NEXT WEEK. EACH SYSTEM WILL TRY TO BRING DRYLINE INTO EASTERN ZONES VERY BRIEFLY WITH THE FIRST ONE LATE MONDAY AND ANOTHER SURGE LATE THURSDAY INTO EARLY FRIDAY. MOISTURE IS NOT EXPECTED TO MAKE IT WEST OF THE RIO GRANDE AND MAY REMAIN OVER HUDSPETH AND OTERO COUNTIES. TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE WEEK WILL WARM TO NEAR NORMAL WITH HIGHS IN THE 80S TO NEAR 90. MINIMUM RELATIVE HUMIDITIES WILL BE FALLING INTO THE 5 TO 15 PERCENT RANGE FOR MOST OF THE WEEK WITH HIGHEST VALUES EAST. OCCASIONAL BREEZY WINDS MAY CREATE NEAR CRITICAL CONDITIONS A COUPLE OF DAYS THIS WEEK WITH FRIDAY HAVING BEST CHANCE FOR WIDESPREAD CRITICAL DEVELOPING.  
THE ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN WILL CONTINUE ACROSS NORTH TEXAS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WITH SEVERAL ADDITIONAL CHANCES FOR RAIN AND THUNDERSTORMS AND CONTINUED FLOODING. THE UPPER LEVEL PATTERN CONTINUES TO FAVOR TROUGHING OVER THE WESTERN U.S. AND RIDGING TO THE EAST OF TEXAS. THIS WILL KEEP THE REGION IN AN ACTIVE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK.  ACROSS NORTH TEXAS THIS AFTERNOON...SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S AND DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 70S. THIS YIELDS SURFACE BASED CAPE OF AROUND 2500 J/KG WITH LITTLE INHIBITION. A LACK OF A STRONG FORCING MECHANISM SUGGESTS THAT CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING SHOULD BE PRIMARILY DIURNALLY DRIVEN AND WEAKEN AFTER SUNSET. DEEP LAYER SHEAR IS AROUND 35KTS BUT MOST OF THIS IS IN THE FORM OF STRONGER WINDS ABOVE 700MB. THE FLOW FROM THE SURFACE TO 700MB IS QUITE WEAK AND SURFACE WINDS ARE EAST-SOUTHEAST IN MANY AREAS. THESE OPPOSING WINDS FROM THE SURFACE THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE ATMOSPHERE SHOULD RESULT IN VERY SLOW MOVING CONVECTION WHICH COULD PRODUCE VERY LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINFALL THROUGH THE EVENING. THERE IS A LOW SEVERE WEATHER THREAT MAINLY IN THE FORM OF DAMAGING WINDS FROM COLLAPSING THUNDERSTORMS.  ONE SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL EJECT NORTHEAST THROUGH THE 4-CORNERS REGION OVERNIGHT. THIS WILL ALLOW CONVECTION ACROSS WEST TEXAS TO BECOME MORE ORGANIZED AND MOVE EAST. THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD WEAKEN AS IT CONTINUES EAST...ALTHOUGH THE LATEST GFS SEEMS TO BE SUFFERING FROM SOME SERIOUS CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK AND HANGS ON TO DEEP CONVECTION THROUGH TOMORROW MORNING ACROSS NORTH TEXAS. THE CURRENT FORECAST WONT BE QUITE SO BULLISH ON POPS OVERNIGHT INTO TUESDAY...HOWEVER...IF THE GFS HAS LATCHED ON TO MORE ROBUST FORCING FOR ASCENT...WE MAY HAVE TO RAISE POPS OVERNIGHT.  ON TUESDAY...RAIN CHANCES SHOULD INCREASE AS ANOTHER DISTURBANCE IN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT MOVES ACROSS THE AREA. THIS COINCIDES WITH A SURGE OF MID LEVEL MOISTURE WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BY LATE AFTERNOON...PRIMARILY WEST OF INTERSTATE 35.  ON WEDNESDAY AND WED NIGHT...A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTHWARD AND RAIN/STORM CHANCES SHOULD INCREASE. SOME SEVERE WEATHER WILL BE POSSIBLE DURING THIS TIME BUT THE MAIN THREAT WILL BE FLOODING FROM ADDITIONAL RAINFALL ON SATURATED SOILS. CONTINUED TROUGHING WILL PERSIST OVER THE SOUTHWEST U.S. THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK WITH ADDITIONAL RAIN CHANCES EACH DAY.   NOTE ABOUT FORECAST RAINFALL AMOUNTS AND RAINFALL GRAPHICS...  WITH THE HEAVY RAINFALL OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AND CONTINUED ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN...FORECAST RAINFALL AMOUNTS HAVE BECOME QUITE POPULAR FOR PLANNING PURPOSES. KEEP IN MIND THAT FORECAST RAINFALL AMOUNTS CAN VARY GREATLY OVER SHORT DISTANCES AND HAVE A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS BUILT IN. THESE PRECIPITATION FORECASTS ASSUME THAT THE OVERALL CONVECTIVE FORECAST IS CORRECT ALONG WITH THE LOCATION AND DURATION OF PRECIPITATION. MULTIPLE DAY PRECIPITATION FORECASTS ARE LIKELY TO INCLUDE MORE THAN ONE ROUND OF PRECIPITATION...AND IT SHOULD NOT BE ASSUMED THAT ALL OF THE PRECIPITATION WILL OCCUR AT ONCE.  OUR CURRENT FORECAST PRECIPITATION OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS HAS ANYWHERE FROM AROUND 1 INCH IN OUR SOUTHEAST TO OVER 2 INCHES IN OUR NORTHWEST COUNTIES THROUGH MID WEEK. ANY OF THESE SCATTERED DIURNAL SHOWERS AND STORMS CAN PUT DOWN CONSIDERABLY MORE PRECIPITATION OVER A SHORT DURATION.  DUNN  
/ISSUED 640 AM CDT MON MAY 18 2015/ THE PRIMARY AVIATION WEATHER CONCERN WITH THIS TAF PACKAGE WILL BE MORNING LOW CLOUDS AND FOG.  A LIGHT SOUTH WIND...MOSTLY CLEAR SKY AND VERY MOIST GROUND HAS RESULTED IN SOME PATCHY DENSE FOG ACROSS NORTH TEXAS EARLY THIS MORNING. THE DENSE FOG IS VERY SHALLOW AND SHOULD AFFECT LOCATIONS PRIMARILY WEST OF THE TAF SITES. HOWEVER...SOME TEMPORARY MVFR CEILINGS AND VISIBILITIES ARE POSSIBLE THROUGH 10 AM...ESPECIALLY IN WACO. ALL CONDITIONS SHOULD IMPROVE TO VFR BY MIDDAY AND REMAIN VFR THROUGH THE NIGHT. BRIEF MVFR CEILINGS MAY RETURN TO ALL TAF SITES AROUND SUNRISE TUESDAY.  IT APPEARS THAT THE BEST THUNDERSTORM CHANCES TODAY WILL BE WELL TO THE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST OF THE TAF SITES IN THE VICINITY OF A WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY AND A LIFTING SHORTWAVE. THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD DEVELOP ACROSS WEST TEXAS OVERNIGHT AND MOVE EASTWARD... BUT THESE SHOULD REMAIN WELL WEST OF THE NORTH TEXAS TERMINALS UNTIL TUESDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING.  A SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST WIND WILL PREVAIL THROUGH TONIGHT AT SPEEDS GENERALLY LESS THAN 12 KNOTS.  79  
FEATURES MOSTLY A BRIEF AND NEEDED BREAK FROM PRECIPITATION AS SOUTH TEXAS SEES WEAK RIDGING AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT. ONLY EXCEPTION HERE IS THAT CONVECTION MAY FIRE OFF THE SIERRA MADRES TO OUR WEST. SHOULD THAT OCCUR...THERE IS A SMALL CHANCE THAT A FEW OF THOSE MAY MEANDER ACROSS THE RIVER INTO OUR FAR WESTERN COUNTIES. OTHER THAN THE ABOVE...EXPECT WARM AND HUMID CONDITIONS WITH BREEZY AFTERNOONS.  
OVER SOUTH TEXAS TO BEGIN THE EXTENDED PART OF THE FORECAST. THIS WILL RESULT IN KEEPING MUCH OF THE AREA DRY WEDNESDAY...BUT LOW POPS WERE RETAINED OVER THE NORTHWEST AREAS. MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE A FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE CENTRAL OR NORTH CENTRAL PART OF THE STATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR AN MCS TO DEVELOP WEDNESDAY NIGHT TO THE NORTHWEST...WITH CONVECTION APPROACHING THE NORTHWEST AND WESTERN AREAS IF COMPLEX HOLDS TOGETHER. REMNANT BOUNDARIES AND APPROACHING SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL LEAD TO DECENT CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND STORMS ON THURSDAY AND WILL KEEP POPS IN THE 40 TO 50 PERCENT RANGE. SHORTWAVE TROUGH PASSES TO THE EAST ON FRIDAY WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO SLIGHTLY LOWER CHANCES OF RAIN. AN ACTIVE PATTERN PERSIST INTO THE WEEKEND AS NEXT LONGWAVE TROUGH ORGANIZES OVER THE WESTERN CONUS THEN SLOWLY SHIFTS TO THE EAST. SEVERAL DISTURBANCES EMBEDDED IN SW FLOW ALOFT WILL TRAVERSE THE AREA AND INTERACT WITH SUFFICIENT MOISTURE. SEVERAL ROUNDS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE DURING THIS TIME. SUNDAY LOOKS TO BE THE MOST FAVORABLE TIME FOR RAINFALL AND WILL HAVE TO MONITOR FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN. TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE EXTENDED WONT VARY TOO MUCH...WITH LOWER 90S OUT WEST WITH 80S ACROSS THE REST OF THE AREA.  
ALL IS QUIET THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BUT THINGS SHOULD START TO PICK UP LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING MAINLY ALONG THE WESTERN CWA. 12Z UPPER ANALYSIS SHOWED THIS AREA UNDER SOUTHWEST FLOW WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN 500 HEIGHT BUT STEEP MID- LEVEL LAPSE RATES. 850 MB ANALYSIS SHOWS THE 850 DEWPOINT AT KDRT TO BE 14C WHICH SIGNIFIES VERY RICH LOW-LEVEL AIRMASS. LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS HAS THE DRYLINE PRETTY FAR TO THE WEST...BUT HI-RES MODEL GUIDANCE IS PERSISTENT WITH INITIATING CONVECTION WEST OF THE RIO GRANDE LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS APPEARS TO BE BEGINNING AT THE PRESENT TIME. THE BIG QUESTION WILL BE HOW MUCH ACTIVITY THERE WILL BE AND WHETHER OR NOT IF FORMS INTO A CONVECTIVE COMPLEX. ANY COMPLEX WOULD HAVE A STORM MOTION THAT WOULD BRING IT INTO OUR WESTERN/SOUTHWESTERN COUNTIES AFTER 00Z. WILL CARRY THE HIGHEST POPS FOR THIS LOCATION AND ALSO MENTION LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL IN THE FORECAST GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE IN PLACE. PW VALUES ARE GREATER THAN 2 STANDARD DEVIATIONS ABOVE NORMAL. SEVERE PARAMETERS WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE POSSIBILITY OF SEVERE WEATHER AND SPC HAS PLACED VAL VERDE COUNTY AND SOME OF MAVERICK AND KINNEY COUNTY IN A SLIGHT RISK WITH A MARGINAL RISK A BIT FARTHER EAST. THE MAIN CONCERN WILL BE HEAVY RAIN ACROSS AREAS WHICH HAS ALREADY SEEN HEAVY RAINFALL...AND THIS IS PRIMARILY THE SOUTHEASTERN COUNTIES. WILL FORGO A FLASH FLOOD WATCH NOW AS THE CONFIDENCE IN THERE BEING ENOUGH ACTIVITY TO BRING A MCS INTO OUR CWA IS LOW...BUT THIS IS POSSIBLE AND SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE WATCHED THIS EVENING. THE OTHER CONCERN THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT IS ANY OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES THAT ARE AROUND THE AREA. THIS MORNING ON VISIBLE SATELLITE WE COULD SEE AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MOVING WEST FROM THE EARLY MORNING ACTIVITY. CANT FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF THE BOUNDARY ANY MORE ON SATELLITE OR ON A SURFACE ANALYSIS BUT THIS DOESNT MEAN IT IS NOT THERE. THE LLJ WILL BE QUITE STRONG AGAIN TONIGHT AND THERE COULD BE REGENERATION OF ACTIVITY ON ANY OLD OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES IN PLACE ACROSS THE CWA.  FOR TOMORROW...THE BEST LOW-LEVEL LIFT SEEN ON 850 THETA-E ADVECTION CHARTS WILL BE ACROSS THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN ZONES AND WILL CARRY THE BEST POPS FOR THESE LOCATIONS. ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE SCATTERED BUT THE STRONGER ACTIVITY WILL BE CAPABLE OF BRIEF HEAVY RAIN. ANY SEVERE CONVECTION SHOULD BE LIMITED TO AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM IN OUR WESTERN COUNTIES...CLOSER TO THE DRYLINE.  FOR TUESDAY NIGHT...THE UPPER LOW CURRENTLY OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL BE MOVING EAST AND AS IT DOES SO CONVECTION SHOULD INCREASE NEAR THE LUBBOCK AREA. THIS CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO GROW INTO A CONVECTIVE COMPLEX AND MCS PROPAGATION VECTORS WILL BRING ANY SYSTEM NEAR OUR NORTHERN ZONES. THINK THE BULK OF THE ACTIVITY WILL REMAIN TO THE NORTH AND WILL CARRY 20 POPS FOR NOW.  
SHOULD SEE A BRIEF LULL IN ACTIVITY ON WEDNESDAY AS SHORTWAVE RIDGING MOVES ACROSS THE AREA. THE FORECAST THEN RETURNS WET WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THERE REMAINS DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE GFS AND OTHER MODEL GUIDANCE ON THE HANDLING OF A COLD FRONT WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. AS HAS BEEN THE NORM FOR THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS...ANOTHER UPPER LOW WILL PUSH INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AT THE SAME TIME THE PREVIOUS UPPER LOW TRACKS THROUGH THE NORTHERN PLAINS. THE LATTER WILL SEND A COLD FRONT SOUTH...BUT IT SHOULD HAVE A HARD TIME MOVING SOUTH AT SOME POINT GIVEN THE SW WINDS ALOFT. THE MAIN DRIVING FOR THE SOUTHWARD PROPAGATION OF THE FRONT SHOULD BE DUE TO CONVECTION/COLD POOLS. WILL CONTINUE TO GO WITH THE CONSENSUS AND HAVE HIGHER POPS DURING THIS TIME FRAME. ADDITIONAL HEAVY RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE.  FOR THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND...THE UPPER LOW WILL DEPART THE SW CONUS AND WILL PASS CLOSER TO OUR AREA THAN THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD KEEP THE HIGHER RAIN CHANCES ONGOING. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF HAVE STRONG SIGNALS FOR HEAVY RAIN SATURDAY NIGHT OR SUNDAY. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS FOR ANY CHANGES. WE MUST CONTINUE TO STRESS...WITH RECENT HEAVY RAINFALL AND POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY LATER THIS WEEK AND AGAIN THIS WEEKEND...WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE POSSIBLE FLASH FLOODING. PLEASE CONTINUE TO STRESS THE TURN AROUND DOWN DROWN SLOGAN AS WE CONTINUE THE ABOVE NORMAL RAINFALL.  
AN ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND AS A SERIES OF UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES MOVE ACROSS THE AREA.  IN THE SHORT TERM, OF PRIMARY CONCERN WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR EXCESSIVE RAINFALL AND SEVERE WEATHER ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO AND SOUTHWEST TEXAS.  THIS AFTERNOON, A GENERALLY SOUTHEAST FLOW WAS INCREASING MOISTURE EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS WITH DEWPOINTS EXCEEDING 60 DEGREES PUSHING THROUGH THE PECOS RIVER VALLEY AND INTO THE SOUTHERN PERMIAN BASIN. COMBINED WITH ABUNDANT INSOLATION AND COOLING ALOFT, CAPE VALUES ARE EXCEEDING 3000 THIS AFTERNOON. DAYTIME HEATING AND UPSLOPE FLOW WILL BRING INITIAL CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT PRIMARILY IN THE DAVIS MOUNTAINS AREA THIS AFTERNOON. WITH MODERATE SHEAR OF 40 KNOTS, DEVELOPMENT OF SUPERCELLS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WIND IS POSSIBLE. LFC LEVELS LESS THAN 2000M SUGGEST THAT ISOLATED TORNADIC DEVELOPMENT ALSO POSSIBLE LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING MAINLY WEST OF THE PECOS RIVER.  AS STORMS MOVE OFF THE HIGHER TERRAIN TOWARD THE NORTHEAST, LOOKING FOR MERGING OF CELLS INTO A LARGER-SCALE COMPLEX AIDED BY DEVELOPMENT OF A SOUTHEASTERLY LOW LEVEL JET THIS EVENING WHICH WILL SUSTAIN INSTABILITY ACROSS THE AREA. HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS WILL REMAIN POSSIBLE AS THE SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE PERMIAN BASIN. A SECONDARY WAVE OF THUNDERSTORMS IS EXPECTED AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES THE AREA LATE TONIGHT. WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER PROGGED OVER 1.5 INCHES ACROSS MUCH OF THE PERMIAN BASIN, HEAVY AND POTENTIALLY EXCESSIVE RAINFALL IS POSSIBLE MAINLY OVER THE CENTRAL TO NORTHERN PERMIAN BASIN. PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED EXIT EASTERN PARTS OF THE PERMIAN BASIN BY MID-DAY TUESDAY. A FLASH FLOOD WATCH WILL BE ISSUED FOR SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO, THE UPPER TRANS-PECOS AND THE PERMIAN BASIN FOR THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH MID-DAY TUESDAY.  AS DRIER AIR MIXES EAST TUESDAY, THE DRYLINE IS EXPECTED TO SET UP NEAR THE TEXAS/NEW MEXICO BORDER TUESDAY AFTERNOON. UNSTABLE CONDITIONS AND MODERATE SHEAR SUGGEST THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE WEATHER ALONG AND EAST OF THE DRYLINE, THOUGH DEVELOPMENT MAY BE INHIBITED IN THE WAKE OF DEPARTING SHORTWAVE AND MCS.  A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH INTO THE AREA WEDNESDAY, BRINGING CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS AGAIN MOSTLY TO EASTERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA, WHERE INSTABILITY WILL BE GREATEST. A MOIST RETURN FLOW AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM WILL FUEL DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY.  
NM...FLASH FLOOD WATCH THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING FOR THE FOLLOWING      ZONES... CENTRAL LEA COUNTY...EDDY COUNTY PLAINS...NORTHERN      LEA COUNTY...SOUTHERN LEA COUNTY.

An active weather pattern is expected to continue through the Memorial Day weekend as a series of upper level disturbances move across the area.  In the short term, of primary concern will be the potential for excessive rainfall and severe weather across parts of southeast New Mexico and southwest Texas.  This afternoon, a generally southeast flow was increasing moisture east of the mountains with dewpoints exceeding 60 degrees pushing through the Pecos River valley and into the southern Permian Basin. Combined with abundant insolation and cooling aloft, CAPE values are exceeding 3000 this afternoon. Daytime heating and upslope flow will bring initial convective development primarily in the Davis Mountains area this afternoon. With moderate shear of 40 knots, development of supercells capable of producing large hail and damaging wind is possible. LFC levels less than 2000m suggest that isolated tornadic development also possible late this afternoon and early evening mainly west of the Pecos River.  As storms move off the higher terrain toward the northeast, looking for merging of cells into a larger-scale complex aided by development of a southeasterly low level jet this evening which will sustain instability across the area. Hail and damaging winds will remain possible as the system moves into the Permian Basin. A secondary wave of thunderstorms is expected as a shortwave trough approaches the area late tonight. With precipitable water progged over 1.5 inches across much of the Permian Basin, heavy and potentially excessive rainfall is possible mainly over the central to northern Permian Basin. Precipitation is expected exit eastern parts of the Permian Basin by mid-day Tuesday. A flash flood watch will be issued for southeast New Mexico, the upper trans-Pecos and the Permian Basin for this afternoon through mid-day Tuesday.  As drier air mixes east Tuesday, the dryline is expected to set up near the Texas/New Mexico border Tuesday afternoon. Unstable conditions and moderate shear suggest the potential for severe weather along and east of the dryline, though development may be inhibited in the wake of departing shortwave and MCS.  A cold front will push into the area Wednesday, bringing chances for thunderstorms again mostly to eastern parts of the forecast area, where instability will be greatest. A moist return flow ahead of the next system will fuel development of showers and thunderstorms Friday into Saturday.  
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
NOW THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS ANCHORED OVER THE CENTRAL GULF WITH LOWER PRESSURE INLAND. EXPECT MODERATE SOUTHEAST WINDS AND MODERATE SEAS THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. SMALL CRAFT SHOULD EXERCISE CAUTION CONDITIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE AT TIMES.  WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY....SOUTHEAST FLOW DOMINATES THE COASTAL WATERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED...REACHING AROUND 15 KNOTS EACH AFTERNOON. THIS WILL KEEP SEAS GENERALLY 3 TO 4 FEET THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK. WEEKEND FORECAST NOTES LOW PRESSURE DEEPENING IN COLORADO...WHICH WILL INCREASE WINDS AND SEAS...ESPECIALLY SUNDAY. CURRENT SEAS FORECAST REACH 6 TO 8 FEET ON SUNDAY...WHICH WOULD NECESSITATE ADVISORIES.   
18Z TAF issuance... The main aviation concern for the next 24 hours is TSRA affecting all terminals at some point this afternoon and/or tonight. Currently have SE winds becoming more established and expect gusts to increase over the next couple of hours. Difficult aviation forecast today, particularly with trying to pinpoint timing and location of TSRA development. Think convection will be more scattered in nature through late evening then become more numerous overnight. As a result, will continue TEMPO TSRA through this evening then prevailing TSRA at most sites through early Tuesday morning. Could see some brief periods of MVFR cigs/vis and gusts up to 40kt with any thunderstorm. Otherwise, will continue to monitor trends and make amendments if/when needed. Have MVFR cigs at MAF and HOB Tuesday morning but conditions should improve by late morning.  
FOR THE 18Z TAFS... MORNING STORMS HAVE CLEARED THE TERMINALS BUT REMNANT CLOUD DEBRIS IS DOING LITTLE TO SUPPRESS HEATING WITH MANY SITES APPROACHING CONVECTIVE TEMPERATURES. ISOLATED TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE AGAIN DURING THE AFTERNOON FOR THE TERMINALS... WITH THE BEST CHANCES FOR TERMINALS ALONG AND SOUTH OF INTERSTATE 10 /KIAH...KSGR...KHOU...KLBX...AND KGLS/ AS THE ATMOSPHERE FARTHER NORTH HAS STABILIZED SOMEWHAT IN THE WAKE OF THIS MORNING/S ACTIVITY. OTHERWISE... VFR CONDITIONS THIS AFTERNOON EXPECTED TO DETERIORATE TO MVFR TONIGHT AS CEILINGS LOWER WITH SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS BECOMING LIGHT AND VARIABLE. COULD SEE SOME PATCHY OVERNIGHT FOG AS WELL... BUT ONLY HIGHLIGHTING CATEGORY CHANGES FOR VISIBILITIES AT KCXO AND KUTS FOR NOW.  HUFFMAN  
DISCUSSION... LATEST IR SATELLITE IMAGERY IS SHOWING STEADY CLOUD TOP WARMING OF THIS MORNING`S SOUTHEAST TEXAS MCS. ESTIMATED RAINFALL RATES HAVE BEEN TRENDING DOWNWARD TOO...AND IT LOOKS LIKE A NEW MCS IN SHREVEPORT`S CWA WILL BE THE FOCUS FOR A MAJORITY OF THE HEAVIEST RAINFALL FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS. BACK IN OUR AREA...RADAR HAS ESTIMATED OVERNIGHT THROUGH EARLY MORNING RAINFALL TOTALS OF 5 TO 10 INCHES FROM SOUTHERN GRIMES COUNTY TO NORTHWEST AUSTIN COUNTY TO NORTHERN COLORADO COUNTY... OR ROUGHLY FROM NAVASOTA TO JUST WEST OF BELLVILLE TO NORTH OF COLUMBUS. LATEST FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE HAS COME IN WITH EXTREMELY LOW ONE HOUR RAINFALL RATES OF 1 INCH IN WASHINGTON COUNTY...1.6 INCHES IN GRIMES COUNTY...AND 1.7 INCHES IN AUSTIN COUNTY. SOME OF OUR HEAVIER RECENT RAIN EVENTS HAVE GIVEN US THESE AMOUNTS IN 30 MINUTES OR LESS! WILL THEREFORE CONTINUE THE FLASH FLOOD WATCH FOR AREAS GENERALLY ALONG AND NORTH OF A LINE FROM COLUMBUS TO KATY TO LIVINGSTON WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ANY DAYTIME HEATING THAT DEVELOPS THIS AFTERNOON COULD SET OFF ANOTHER ROUND OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON ALREADY SATURATED GROUNDS. 42  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 548 AM CDT MON MAY 18 2015/  DISCUSSION... NOW GETTING RATES >2"/HR. THIS WILL LIKELY CAUSE SOME FF ISSUES AND ISSUED A FLASH FLOOD WATCH GENERALLY NORTH OF A COLUMBUS-LIVINGSTON LINE. HARRIS IS NOT INCLUDED ATTM BUT WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE TRENDS. 47  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 426 AM CDT MON MAY 18 2015/ SFC ANALYSIS STILL SHOWS A REMNANT BOUNDARY SITUATED FROM ROUGHLY LIVINGSTON TO COLUMBUS. HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN PRECIP COVERAGE ALONG THIS FEATURE IN THE PAST HOUR AS SLY LLVL FLOW FROM THE GULF FEEDS INTO IT. PW`S AROUND 2" ARE IN THE REGION AND UPPER FLOW IS NOTICEABLY DIFFLUENT OVER SAME BOUNDARY. W/V IMAGERY ALSO SHOWS SOME WEAK IMPULSES EMBEDDED IN THE FLOW ALOFT APPROACHING FROM S TX. ANTICIPATE CONTINUED INCREASE IN PRECIP COVERAGE THRU THE MORNING WITH A FAVORABLE PATTERN FOR REGENERATING/TRAINING LOCALIZED CLUSTERS OF RAINFALL - SOME LOCALLY HEAVY. STILL CONTEMPLATING A FFA AND MIGHT PULL THE TRIGGER LATER THIS MORNING AFTER KEEPING EYE ON TRENDS FOR A WHILE. GUIDANCE SUGGEST 2-2.5" COULD CAUSE PROBLEMS IF IT WERE TO FALL IN AN HOUR, 2.8-3.3 IN 3 HOURS. THINK WE`LL NEED TO WATCH FOR COVERAGE TO FILL IN SOUTH OF THE SFC BOUNDARY THIS MORNING AND AFTERNOON WITH DAYTIME HEATING. PRECIP SHOULD TAPER OFF W/ LOSS OF HEATING TONIGHT.  TROF CURRENTLY OVER CA WILL KICK OUT AND INTO NCNTL PLAINS ON TUE AND ITS REPLACEMENT WILL DROP BACK INTO PLACE MID/LATE WEEK. ALTHOUGH SLIGHT H5 RIDGING IS EXPECTED TO NOSE INTO THE AREA FROM MEXICO & GULF AS THIS OCCURS...STILL ANTICIPATE DAILY SCT SHRA/TSTMS WITH HEATING.  THINGS GET INTERESTING AGAIN BY THURS AS MOST MODELS (W/ EXCEPTION OF GFS) BRING A FRONT INTO THE REGION & PROVIDE ANOTHER BOUNDARY TO WORK WITH. UNSETTLED WX WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE INTO MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND (ESP SUN/MON) AS WESTERN TROF APPROACHES. 47  MARINE... ONSHORE WINDS HAVE WEAKENED A BIT THIS MORNING BUT EXPECTING THEM TO PICK UP AGAIN LATER THIS MORNING AS PCPN OVER INLAND SE TX BEGINS TO FILL IN. WILL BE KEEPING THE SCEC UP FOR THE OFFSHORE WATERS FOR TO- DAY. OTHERWISE NO REAL CHANGE WITH THE FCST OF MOSTLY LIGHT/MODERATE WINDS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDING OVER THE SRN ROCKIES WILL HELP TO PUSH A WEAK COLD FRONT INTO SE TX EARLY THU. AT THIS TIME...NOT EXPECTING A WIND SHIFT FOR THE BAYS/NEARSHORE WATERS BUT WE COULD SEE A MORE ELY COMPONENT TO THE WINDS DURING THIS TIME- FRAME. 41  AVIATION... A STRONGLY DIFFLUENT PATTERN ALOFT COMBINED WITH DISTURBANCES MOVING IN FROM THE WEST AND A LINGERING OUTFLOW BOUNDARY SHOULD ALLOW FOR A GRADUAL INCREASE OF ACTIVITY ON THE RADAR ACROSS SE TX THRU THE REST OF THIS MORNING. WILL LIKELY BE ADDING THE MENTION OF VCTS/TEMPOS TO SITES NORTH OF I-10 WITH AMDS SHORTLY. OTHERWISE WILL KEEP WITH MVFR CIGS THIS AFTN...POSSIBLY IFR CIGS TONIGHT. 41   
VFR DETERIORATING TO IFR TONIGHT AT ALL SITES. SURGE OF MOISTURE INTO THE REGION WILL BREED SCT TSRA SW OF LBB LATER THIS AFTN BEFORE REACHING LBB AND PVW THIS EVENING. MUCH BETTER CHANCE FOR WIDESPREAD TSRA DEVELOPMENT SHOULD OCCUR EARLY TUE MORNING FROM W-E AS AN UPPER TROUGH REACHES THE AREA. IFR CIGS ARE LIKELY TO PERSIST THRU 18Z TUE AS MOIST E-SE UPSLOPE WINDS PERSIST.  
PERIOD...PROVIDING BASIS FOR VFR CIGS THIS AFTERNOON...LOWERING TO MVFR OVERNIGHT. MODERATE SOUTHEAST WINDS WILL DIMINISH OVERNIGHT BEFORE RESUMING TOWARD THE END OF THE PERIOD.  
DISCUSSION...UPDATED FOR THE 12Z AVIATION DISCUSSION.  AVIATION...CIGS AND VSBYS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE THROUGH THE MORNING. CONVECTION NORTH OF VCT SHOULD CONTINUE AN EAST-NORTHEAST MOVEMENT AWAY FROM VCT...HOWEVER ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL STILL REMAIN POSSIBLE AROUND VCT. WILL CONTINUE TO EXPECTED ISOLATED CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON BUT NOT ENOUGH TO MENTION IN TAFS. BREEZY CONDITIONS WILL DEVELOP WITH GUSTS OF 20-25KTS FROM CRP- ALI-VCT. A RETURN OF MVFR CIGS IS EXPECTED LATE THIS EVENING.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 500 AM CDT MON MAY 18 2015/  SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...CONVECTION DEVELOPING ALONG THETA-E RIDGE AND LEFT OVER BOUNDARIES NORTH OF THE CWA. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE PUMPED INTO THE REGION WITH EXTRA CONVERGENCE ACROSS THE NORTHERN AND NORTHEASTERN AREAS VIA AN INVERTED TROUGH/LOW TO THE SOUTH. INSTABILITY IS AVAILABLE PER THE LAPS ANALYSIS AND IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN THROUGH THE REST OF TODAY. DESPITE A BROAD WEAK UPPER RIDGE IN PLACE EXTENDING FROM THE WESTERN GULF...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL REMAIN POSSIBLE TODAY. HOWEVER...THE BEST DYNAMICS REMAIN WELL TO THE NORTH OF THE CWA AS THE UPPER JET SPLITS CREATING A BETTER DIFLUENT FLOW ALOFT. H85 TEMPS CONTINUE TO RUN 16C-18C ACROSS THE AREA...WHICH IS WARM BUT NOT TOO STRONG TO HINDER ANY DEVELOPMENT FROM BACKBUILDING INTO THE NORTHERN ZONES. WITH THE BETTER DYNAMICS LIFTING NORTH THROUGH THE DAY...ISOLATED CONVECTION REMAINS POSSIBLE INTO THE AFTERNOON ACROSS THE INLAND AND WESTERN AREAS WITH DAYTIME HEATING. FOCUS SHIFTS WEST THIS EVENING AS A MIDLEVEL SHORTWAVE HELPS INITIATE ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE SIERRA MADRE WHICH MAY NEAR THE WESTERN ZONES. TUESDAY SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY QUIETER WITH MORNING STREAMER SHOWERS TRANSITIONING TO ISOLATED INLAND DEVELOPMENT DUE TO DAYTIME HEATING.  LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SOUTH TEXAS WILL BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE RIDGE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...KEEPING MOST OF THE AREA DRY. THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT CHANCE STORMS WILL AFFECT THE NORTHWESTERN BRUSH COUNTRY TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. 00Z ECMWF CONTINUES TO DEPICT A COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH NORTH TEXAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND STALLING OVER SOUTH-CENTRAL TEXAS THURSDAY EVENING. POTENTIAL FOR MCS TO FORM OVER THE BIG COUNTRY AND BACKBUILD TO SOUTHWEST INTO THE WESTERN HILL COUNTRY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS REGION OF LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE WITH THE FRONT IS IN PROXIMITY WITH DIFLUENT FLOW ALOFT DOWNSTREAM FROM THE NEXT UPPER LOW MOVING INTO CALIFORNIA. EXPECT A GOOD CHANCE THE MCS WILL MOVE TOWARD REGION ON THURSDAY AS THE FRONT STALLS NORTH OF THE AREA. WILL CONTINUE TO SHOW GOOD CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY. A STRONG SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE NORTHEAST FROM NORTHEAST MEXICO TO CENTRAL TEXAS THURSDAY NIGHT. WILL SHOW GOOD CHANCE POPS OVER THE BRUSH COUNTRY FOR THURSDAY NIGHT. THE FRONT WILL LIFT NORTH BY FRIDAY WITH A LITTLE LOWER CHANCE FOR RAIN FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. ACTIVE PATTERN OF STORM SYSTEMS MOVING OUT OF THE DESERT SOUTHWEST THROUGH THE ROCKIES REPEATS AGAIN LATE WEEK. THE NEXT UPPER LOW WILL BE OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FRIDAY MORNING AND MOVE ACROSS THE FOUR CORNERS REGION SATURDAY AND INTO THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS SUNDAY. ECMWF SHOWS THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS EXTENDING SOUTHWEST INTO NORTHWEST MEXICO FOR SATURDAY AND MOVING TOWARD SOUTH TEXAS ON SUNDAY. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES MAY BE UP AROUND 2 INCHES AGAIN BY THE WEEKEND LEADING TO ANOTHER POTENTIAL ROUND OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.  
/18Z TAFS/  IFR/MVFR stratus returns late evening and overnight. Have VCTS for scattered thunderstorms around KSJT and KSOA this evening. Thunderstorms likely toward and after 12Z at KABI as storm complex moves east. Most areas should rise to MVFR mid morning, except KABI due to rain cooled stratus around showers and thunderstorms.   
AVIATION... /12Z TAFS/  MVFR/IFR ceilings will continue at all sites, then become VFR by late morning or early afternoon. Isolated to scattered showers and thunderstorms will be possible this afternoon. A VCTS group was included at all sites, except KABI. Showers and thunderstorms across West Texas may affect the terminals late this evening or early Tuesday morning, but confidence is not high enough to include in the current TAF package. A return of MVFR ceilings is forecast by late this evening or early Tuesday morning.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 338 AM CDT Mon May 18 2015/  SHORT TERM... (Today and Tonight)  Near normal temperatures can be expected this afternoon with highs mainly in the upper 80s. Abundant low level moisture will be present today, with dewpoint temperatures in the mid to upper 60s. As we heat up this afternoon, high resolution models are hinting that we should break the cap to allow for at least isolated to scattered showers and thunderstorms this afternoon, mainly across the southern two thirds of the region. At the same time, an upper level disturbance will approach from northern Mexico, resulting in showers and thunderstorms over West Texas/Big Bend Region. Some of this activity may move into at least the western counties of West Central Texas tonight, and this is where the highest PoPs were placed. Some of these storms may be strong to severe, although the severe threat will wane as we head into the late evening/early morning hours. Overnight lows will generally be in the mid 60s to near 70.  LONG TERM... (Tuesday through Monday)  Little change to the ongoing forecast, with rain chances persisting through much of the week. The overall upper level pattern of a trough over the western US and a ridge over the central or eastern US will continue, with southwest flow aloft across West Central Texas. Plenty of low level moisture in place with dewpoints in the 60s. Series of shortwaves will rotate through the main trough, creating the lift needed for convection. Always hard to pin down these waves much more than 48 hours in advance, so best rain chances will be Tuesday with models now consistent in forecasting one of these shortwave to pass just west of the area. As this wave passes, models push a cold front into the area for Wednesday Night and Thursday. Cooler air mass behind it, with highs as cool as the upper 60s for areas north and west of Abilene. This front will settle into the I-10 corridor and then begin to shift back northward as a warm front. Between the shortwaves rotating through aloft and the frontal boundary at the surface, have to continue at least scattered showers and thunderstorms every period through the end of the week and into the weekend.  
LOW CLOUDS IN THE MVFR RANGE AT DHT AND GUY SHOULD DISSIPATE AS THIS FORECAST IS ISSUED. LOW CLOUDS AND RAIN ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN COVERAGE LATER THIS EVENING AS SOUTHEAST WINDS RAMP UP. A WIDESPREAD AREA OF SHOWERS AND SOME THUNDERSTORMS IS EXPECTED TO SWING FROM WEST TO EAST ACROSS THE TAF SITES AFTER MIDNIGHT THROUGH THE END OF THIS FORECAST. HAVE GONE AHEAD AND PUT IN SHOWERS AND IFR CONDITIONS IN THE PREVAILING GROUP AT ALL TAF SITES. TSRA WILL BE POSSIBLE AT EACH TAF SITE...BUT AM NOT CONFIDENT ON THE TIMING...SO HAVE GONE WITH THE MOST LIKELY WEATHER TYPE FOR NOW.  
AVIATION... 12Z TAFS...VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON. A COLD FRONT CURRENTLY DRAPED OVER THE OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE WILL DRIFT SOUTHWARD AND WILL CONTINUE TURNING WINDS NORTH THIS MORNING...THEN SOUTHEASTERLY BEHIND IT THIS AFTERNOON. MVFR TO LOW-VFR CEILINGS WILL DEVELOP AFTER 00Z...AND SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OVER THE WESTERN PANHANDLES TONIGHT AND SPREAD NORTHEASTWARD DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. IFR CONDITIONS WILL BE LIKELY DURING PERIODS OF HEAVIER RAIN AND POSSIBLY PREDOMINANT BY THE END OF THIS TAF CYCLE.  ELSENHEIMER  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 433 AM CDT MON MAY 18 2015/  DISCUSSION... THE VERY WET PATTERN WILL CONTINUE THIS WEEK BEFORE POSSIBLY SHOWING SOME SIGNS OF BREAKING DOWN NEXT WEEK. A SPLIT FLOW UPPER LEVEL PATTERN WILL PERSIST THIS WEEK WITH A STRONGER THAN NORMAL SRN STREAM FEATURING EMBEDDED SHORTWAVE TROFS OR CLOSED LOWS.  THE NEXT CLOSED LOW IN THE SEEMINGLY ENDLESS SERIES WAS SITUATED NEAR THE CNTRL CA COAST EARLY THIS MORNING. THIS STORM SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO ROTATE NEWD TOWARDS WY BY LATE TUESDAY AFTERNOON...THEN OVER THE NRN PLAINS BY WED MORNING AND WEAKEN FURTHER. A SFC COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE MOVG SLOWLY ACROSS THE TX AND OK PNHDLS TODAY AND SETTLE SOUTH OF THE FCST AREA. BEHIND THIS BOUNDARY...EAST TO SE LOW LEVEL MOIST UPSLOPE FLOW WILL COMMENCE TODAY ACROSS THE REGION. AS THE UPPER LEVEL STORM SYSTEM BEGINS MOVG ENE THROUGH TONIGHT AND TUE...THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL BECOME MORE DIFFLUENT ACROSS THE SRN HIGH PLAINS DURG THIS PERIOD. ALL THIS...COUPLED WITH INCREASING LIFT FROM THE UPPER LEVEL STORM SYSTEM AND DEEP MOISTURE SUGGESTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND TSTMS TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY. HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE ACROSS THE FCST AREA TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. DECIDED TO MENTION THIS POTENTIAL IN THE WEATHER GRIDS AND PUBLIC PRODUCTS. CONTEMPLATED A FLOOD WATCH BUT WILL LET NEXT SHIFT EVALUATE FURTHER TODAY...AND ONE MAY BECOME NECESSARY FOR TONIGHT AND TUESDAY ACROSS PARTS IF NOT ALL THE FCST AREA. INCREASED POPS MORE TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...THEN TAPERED VALUES FROM WEST TO EAST TUE NIGHT AS THE STORM SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE NRN PLAINS AND WEAKENS. A REINFORCING SURGE OF COOLER AIR LOOKS PLAUSIBLE LATE TUE NIGHT AND WED. MODELS ARE DIVIDED ON HOW MUCH DRY AIR FILTERS IN FOR WED AND THURSDAY. HAVE COMPROMISED AND RESTRICTED POPS TO JUST SLGT CHC VALUES FOR PARTS OF THE AREA WED THRU THURSDAY.  FOR THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...THE NEXT CLOSED UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO DIG DOWN TO NEAR THE SRN CA COAST THURSDAY NIGHT...THEN HEAD TOWARDS THE FOUR CORNERS REGION BY SAT MORNING... AND FINALLY INTO THE CNTRL PLAINS BY SUNDAY MORNING. MOISTURE WILL RAPIDLY RETURN THURSDAY NIGHT FOR THIS STORM SYSTEM TO UTILIZE...AND HAVE RAISED POPS SOME FOR THU NIGHT THRU FRI NIGHT. AS THIS UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVES CLOSER SATURDAY...POPS WERE FASHIONED IN A GRADIENT WITH SLGT CHC VALUES WRN ZONES...INCREASING TO HIGH CHC ERN ZONES. POPS WERE THEN RESTRICTED TO JUST THE ERN ZONES SATURDAY NIGHT. DRY WEATHER THEN RETURNS FOR NEXT SUNDAY AND MONDAY AT THIS TIME.  ANDRADE  
EXPECTING A LOW VFR SCT/BKN DECK THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE DAY TODAY ACROSS THE REGION. OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES ARE RESULTING IN AN EAST WIND AT KAUS AND KSAT/KSSF. TS POTENTIAL WILL BE VERY ISOLATED ALONG THE I35 CORRIDOR IF AT ALL TODAY. BETTER SHOT AT TS WILL BE AT KDRT THIS EVENING AND THUS INCLUDED VCTS THERE AFTER BEGINNING AT 00Z. EXPECTING ALL TERMINALS TO SEE IFR CIGS DEVELOP OVERNIGHT TONIGHT MUCH LIKE THE PREVIOUS NIGHT.  
UPDATE... SIGNIFICANT CONVECTION HAS MOVED EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA AND CURRENTLY...ONLY ISOLATED SHOWER ACTIVITY REMAINS ALONG THE I-35 CORRIDOR. VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A BOUNDARY FROM THE MORNING ACTIVITY MOVING WEST AND IS CURRENTLY NEAR THE I-35 CORRIDOR AND THIS IS WHAT IS MOST LIKELY SERVING AS A FOCUS FOR THE CURRENT ISOLATED ACTIVITY. WILL RECONFIGURE POPS TO HAVE THE HIGHEST POPS NEAR THIS BOUNDARY FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS. THE ATMOSPHERE REMAINS QUITE MOIST WITH SURFACE DEWPOINTS GREATER THAN 75F ACROSS THE EASTERN COUNTIES. ANY ACTIVITY THAT DOES DEVELOP COULD PRODUCE HEAVY RAINFALL AND COULD LEAD TO ADDITIONAL FLOODING CONCERNS. LATER TODAY...SHOULD SEE ACTIVITY ALONG THE DRYLINE JUST WEST OF THE CWA. MOTION VECTORS AND THE ENVIRONMENT SHOULD SUPPORT STORMS MOVING INTO OUR WESTERN COUNTIES. WILL REASSESS THE POTENTIAL FOR HOW MUCH ACTIVITY WILL MAKE IT AND IF WE NEED ANY HIGHLIGHTS TONIGHT FOR POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL FLOODING.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 550 AM CDT MON MAY 18 2015/  AVIATION... SHRA/TSRA ALL AREAS TODAY WILL SHIFT TO THE RIO GRANDE PLAINS AND EDWARDS TONIGHT...THEN EDWARDS PLATEAU...HILL COUNTRY AND AUSTIN AREA TUESDAY. ISOLD SHRA/TSRA ARE EXPECTED ELSEWHERE. FOR NOW... HAVE LEFT MENTION OUT OF TAFS AS PROBS ARE TOO LOW TO MENTION. IFR/MVFR CIGS LIFT TO VFR MIDDAY INTO AFTERNOON. MVFR CIGS RETURN THIS EVENING...THEN IFR OVERNIGHT AND BACK TO MVFR TUESDAY. PATCHY IFR/MVFR VSBYS IN BR ARE EXPECTED EARLY THIS MORNING AND OVERNIGHT TONIGHT AS WELL IN SHRA/TSRA. S TO SE WINDS 5 TO 15 KTS PREVAIL WITH GUSTS TO 25 KTS POSSIBLE.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 353 AM CDT MON MAY 18 2015/  SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...WEAK MID LEVEL FORCING AND STRENGTHENING LOW LEVEL JET ARE CONTRIBUTING TO SCATTERED SHOWER AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT EARLY THIS MORNING. COVERAGE SHOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE THROUGH THE EARLY TO MID MORNING HOURS...EVENTUALLY FOCUSING MORE TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST CWA...NORTHEAST OF A SAN MARCOS TO HALLETTSVILLE LINE...AS MID LEVEL FLOW VEERS MORE SOUTHWEST AND SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR WORKS INTO THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES.  CONVECTION SHOULD ALSO FIRE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF MEXICO AND ACROSS THE BIG BEND AND WEST TEXAS NEAR THE DRY LINE. A FEW OF THESE STORMS COULD REACH WESTERN AREAS OF THE EDWARDS PLATEAU AND RIO GRANDE PLAINS THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. A STRONGER STORM OR TWO WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THIS REGION.  TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT THE UPPER LEVEL LOW CURRENTLY OVER CALIFORNIA WILL SHEAR NORTHEAST THROUGH THE ROCKIES. A LEAD MID AND UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE WILL PASS THROUGH WEST TEXAS AND THE PANHANDLE...AND INTO NORTH TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA. THE MAIN FORCING WILL PASS PRIMARILY NORTH OF THE CWA...BUT CLOSE ENOUGH FOR SCATTERED POPS NORTH OF A DEL RIO TO AUSTIN LINE ON TUESDAY.  LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL DEVELOP OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. INITIALLY SHOULD SEE A REDUCTION IN POPS ON WEDNESDAY WITH SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR IN PLACE...STRENGTHENING CAP...AND LACK OF FORCING.  FORECAST CONFIDENCE DECREASES WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY... DEPENDENT ON SOUTHWARD PROGRESSION OF A COLD FRONT. BOTH THE NAM12 AND ECMWF ARE STRONGER AND FARTHER SOUTH THAN THE GFS WITH A COLD FRONT THAT DROPS SOUTH BEHIND THE AFOREMENTIONED DEPARTING SHORTWAVE THROUGH THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TUESDAY NIGHT. BOTH HAVE THE FRONT ENTERING THE HILL COUNTRY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND BISECTING THE CWA BY 12Z THURSDAY. ORGANIZED CONVECTION AND ASSOCIATED OUTFLOW TO THE NORTH ON WEDNESDAY WILL LIKELY PLAY A ROLE ON HOW FAR SOUTH FRONT MAKES IT WEDNESDAY NIGHT. FOR NOW HAVE FOLLOWED SLIGHTLY CLOSER TO THE NAM12/ECMWF SOLUTIONS OVER THE GFS...SHOWING THE FRONT WILL BE CLOSE OR INTO THE CWA WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. BACKED FLOW...MOISTURE POOLING...WEAKENING CAP AND THE FRONT SHOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN POPS...ESPECIALLY NORTHERN AND WESTERN AREAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND SOUTHERN AND WESTERN AREAS THURSDAY.  CONFIDENCE IS EVEN LOWER THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY ON WHERE FRONT STALLS AND WHEN IT EVENTUALLY LIFTS BACK NORTH. AGAIN...CONVECTIVE OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WILL LIKELY PLAY A ROLE IN THIS. TIMING OF ANY DISTURBANCES ALSO IN THE APPROACHING ACTIVE SUB-TROPICAL BRANCH OF THE JET STREAM ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PINPOINT THIS FAR OUT. BUT GENERALLY CONTINUED SCATTERED POPS IN THE FORECAST THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. TEMPERATURES ALSO TRICKY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY... AND MAY HAVE TO BE LOWERED IN FUTURE PACKAGES ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS FOR THURSDAY IF FRONT IS FARTHER SOUTH.  EVENTUALLY THE SECOND UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER CALIFORNIA OPENS AND MOVES EAST FRIDAY AND INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND TEXAS OVER THE WEEKEND. BOTH THE ECMWF AND GFS ARE INDICATE ANOTHER GOOD SHOT OF PRECIP SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.  
DEVELOPING OVER THE LOWER VALLEY AS MDT TO BREEZY SOUTHEAST WINDS PREVAIL. THE MORNING SOUNDING SHOWS THAT AN OVERNIGHT INVERSION FORMED...AND A FEW LOW CLOUDS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED BELOW 3 KFT... BUT WITH MIXING...ANY AFTN CIGS WILL LIKELY BE ABOVE 3 KFT. HOW EVER...AS WINDS DIMINISH THIS EVENING CIGS WILL LOWER TO MVFR FOR THE NIGHT. IN GENERAL...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GULF INTERACTING WITH LOWER PRESSURE INLAND WILL MAINTAIN SOUTHEAST WINDS OVER THE AREA. WINDS WILL BE LIGHT AT NIGHT AND MDT TO BREEZY DURING THE DAY. BKN VFR CONDITIONS WILL LIKELY DROP TO BKN TO OVC MVFR AT NIGHT.  
DISCUSSION...UPDATED FOR LATEST AVIATION DISCUSSION BELOW.  AVIATION...SCATTERED TO BROKEN CLOUD DECK AROUND 1800 FEET WITH HAZE IS CURRENTLY ACROSS THE AREA. THE HAZE WILL REMAIN THROUGH THE DAY DUE TO AGRICULTURAL BURNING IN MEXICO BUT VIS WILL BE LOWER EARLY THIS MORNING DUE LIGHT WIND AND LOW MIXING. EXPECT VFR CONDITIONS THROUGH THE DAY WITH MIX OF CU CLOUDS AND SUN. DRY AIR COMING FROM THE GULF WILL STABILIZE THE ATMOSPHERE ENOUGH TO LIMIT CONVECTION TODAY. THE WINDS WILL PICK UP WITH DAYTIME MIXING WITH GUSTS UP 20 TO 25 KNOTS BUT WILL DECOUPLE THIS EVENING. CLOUDS RETURN OVERNIGHT WITH INVERSION DEVELOPING AND CEILINGS AROUND 2000 FEET.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 401 AM CDT MON MAY 18 2015/  SHORT TERM /NOW THROUGH TUESDAY/...UPPER LEVEL LOW ENTERING NORTHERN CA WILL CONTINUE ITS TRACK EAST/NORTHEAST OVER THE GREAT BASIN MONDAY WHILE WEAK RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS. THIS WILL PROVIDE A MORE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT ACROSS SOUTH TX WHILE SOME PERTURBATIONS MOVE ACROSS THE MEAN FLOW. THE SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW IN THE LOWER LEVELS WILL BRING SLIGHT DRIER AIR INTO THE AREA WHILE THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAIN NEAR THE SIERRA MADRE WHERE THE CONVECTION WILL BE CONCENTRATED DURING THE DAY. THE ACTIVITY SHOULD REMAIN WEST OF THE CWA NOT IMPACTING THE WESTERN COUNTIES BY THE AFTERNOON HOURS. THERE WILL BE A MIX OF SUN AND CLOUDS AS THE DRY AIR MIXES NOT ALLOWING FOR MUCH CONVECTION OVER THE RGV. TEMPERATURES WILL RISE TO NEAR 90S ACROSS THE CWA AND MID 80S NEAR THE COASTAL AREAS.  TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...AS THE LOW PRESSURE MOVES NORTHEAST...A FRONT MOVES SOUTH OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. THE FRONT REMAINS NORTH OF THE AREA WHILE SE FLOW BRINGS DEEP MOISTURE AHEAD OF IT. CLOUD COVER WILL INCREASE TONIGHT WITH BKN TO OVERCAST CEILINGS WHILE WINDS DECOUPLED. LOW TEMPERATURES WILL RANGE BETWEEN THE MID TO UPPER 70S WITH HUMID CONDITIONS. INTO TUESDAY... GRADIENT WILL STRENGTHEN INCREASING SE WINDS TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING AS HIGH PRESSURE INTERACTS WITH LEE TROUGH ALONG THE SIERRA MADRE. CONVECTION WILL HAVE A SIMILAR TREND AS MONDAY WITH MOST OF THE ACTIVITY REMAINING TO THE WEST NEAR THE SIERRA MADRE WITH NO MUCH ACTIVITY EXPECTED OVER THE CWA.  LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...DEEP SOUTH TEXAS AND THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY ON THE NORTHERN FRINGE OF 500 MB HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER CENTRAL MEXICO WILL PRODUCE DRY WEATHER FOR TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM NEIGHBORING MEXICO MAY AFFECT THE WESTERN AND/OR NORTHERN HALF OF THE BRO CWFA WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY AS THE HIGH DAMPENS AND THE MID-LEVEL FLOW OVERHEAD BECOMES ORIENTED MORE OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST. DRY WEATHER MAY BRIEFLY RETURN FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY AS PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES DROP SLIGHTLY AND THE ATMOSPHERE BECOME MORE DRY. HOWEVER...CONVECTION IS FORECAST TO INCREASE IN COVERAGE SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY AS THE ATMOSPHERE MOISTENS AGAIN AND MORE SIGNIFICANT 500 MB DISTURBANCES PASS OVERHEAD. WITH NO SIGNIFICANT WEATHER SYSTEMS LIKELY TO AFFECT THE BRO CWFA...DAYTIME AND OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY PREVAIL AT ABOVE NORMAL LEVELS.  MARINE...NOW THROUGH TUESDAY...PRESSURE GRADIENT STRENGTHENING ACROSS THE GULF COAST WILL INCREASE SE WINDS THIS AFTERNOON BECOMING EASTERLY TONIGHT. SEAS WILL INCREASE CLOSE TO 6 FEET AND REMAIN BELOW SCEC LEVEL THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. DRY AIR IN THE AREA WILL LIMIT THE POTENTIAL FOR CONVECTION IN THE SHORT TERM.  TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...GENERALLY MODERATE WINDS AND SEAS...WITH POSSIBLE PERIODIC SMALL CRAFT EXERCISE CAUTION...ARE EXPECTED TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO INTERACTING WITH WEAK LOW PRESSURE INLAND. WINDS AND SEAS MAY APPROACH SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CRITERIA SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY AS THE HIGH/LOW PRESSURE INTERACTION INTENSIFIES.  
SIGNIFICANT CONVECTION HAS MOVED EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA AND CURRENTLY...ONLY ISOLATED SHOWER ACTIVITY REMAINS ALONG THE I-35 CORRIDOR. VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A BOUNDARY FROM THE MORNING ACTIVITY MOVING WEST AND IS CURRENTLY NEAR THE I-35 CORRIDOR AND THIS IS WHAT IS MOST LIKELY SERVING AS A FOCUS FOR THE CURRENT ISOLATED ACTIVITY. WILL RECONFIGURE POPS TO HAVE THE HIGHEST POPS NEAR THIS BOUNDARY FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS. THE ATMOSPHERE REMAINS QUITE MOIST WITH SURFACE DEWPOINTS GREATER THAN 75F ACROSS THE EASTERN COUNTIES. ANY ACTIVITY THAT DOES DEVELOP COULD PRODUCE HEAVY RAINFALL AND COULD LEAD TO ADDITIONAL FLOODING CONCERNS. LATER TODAY...SHOULD SEE ACTIVITY ALONG THE DRYLINE JUST WEST OF THE CWA. MOTION VECTORS AND THE ENVIRONMENT SHOULD SUPPORT STORMS MOVING INTO OUR WESTERN COUNTIES. WILL REASSESS THE POTENTIAL FOR HOW MUCH ACTIVITY WILL MAKE IT AND IF WE NEED ANY HIGHLIGHTS TONIGHT FOR POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL FLOODING.  
AVIATION... SHRA/TSRA ALL AREAS TODAY WILL SHIFT TO THE RIO GRANDE PLAINS AND EDWARDS TONIGHT...THEN EDWARDS PLATEAU...HILL COUNTRY AND AUSTIN AREA TUESDAY. ISOLD SHRA/TSRA ARE EXPECTED ELSEWHERE. FOR NOW... HAVE LEFT MENTION OUT OF TAFS AS PROBS ARE TOO LOW TO MENTION. IFR/MVFR CIGS LIFT TO VFR MIDDAY INTO AFTERNOON. MVFR CIGS RETURN THIS EVENING...THEN IFR OVERNIGHT AND BACK TO MVFR TUESDAY. PATCHY IFR/MVFR VSBYS IN BR ARE EXPECTED EARLY THIS MORNING AND OVERNIGHT TONIGHT AS WELL IN SHRA/TSRA. S TO SE WINDS 5 TO 15 KTS PREVAIL WITH GUSTS TO 25 KTS POSSIBLE.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 353 AM CDT MON MAY 18 2015/  SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...WEAK MID LEVEL FORCING AND STRENGTHENING LOW LEVEL JET ARE CONTRIBUTING TO SCATTERED SHOWER AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT EARLY THIS MORNING. COVERAGE SHOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE THROUGH THE EARLY TO MID MORNING HOURS...EVENTUALLY FOCUSING MORE TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST CWA...NORTHEAST OF A SAN MARCOS TO HALLETTSVILLE LINE...AS MID LEVEL FLOW VEERS MORE SOUTHWEST AND SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR WORKS INTO THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES.  CONVECTION SHOULD ALSO FIRE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF MEXICO AND ACROSS THE BIG BEND AND WEST TEXAS NEAR THE DRY LINE. A FEW OF THESE STORMS COULD REACH WESTERN AREAS OF THE EDWARDS PLATEAU AND RIO GRANDE PLAINS THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. A STRONGER STORM OR TWO WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THIS REGION.  TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT THE UPPER LEVEL LOW CURRENTLY OVER CALIFORNIA WILL SHEAR NORTHEAST THROUGH THE ROCKIES. A LEAD MID AND UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE WILL PASS THROUGH WEST TEXAS AND THE PANHANDLE...AND INTO NORTH TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA. THE MAIN FORCING WILL PASS PRIMARILY NORTH OF THE CWA...BUT CLOSE ENOUGH FOR SCATTERED POPS NORTH OF A DEL RIO TO AUSTIN LINE ON TUESDAY.  LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL DEVELOP OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. INITIALLY SHOULD SEE A REDUCTION IN POPS ON WEDNESDAY WITH SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR IN PLACE...STRENGTHENING CAP...AND LACK OF FORCING.  FORECAST CONFIDENCE DECREASES WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY... DEPENDENT ON SOUTHWARD PROGRESSION OF A COLD FRONT. BOTH THE NAM12 AND ECMWF ARE STRONGER AND FARTHER SOUTH THAN THE GFS WITH A COLD FRONT THAT DROPS SOUTH BEHIND THE AFOREMENTIONED DEPARTING SHORTWAVE THROUGH THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TUESDAY NIGHT. BOTH HAVE THE FRONT ENTERING THE HILL COUNTRY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND BISECTING THE CWA BY 12Z THURSDAY. ORGANIZED CONVECTION AND ASSOCIATED OUTFLOW TO THE NORTH ON WEDNESDAY WILL LIKELY PLAY A ROLE ON HOW FAR SOUTH FRONT MAKES IT WEDNESDAY NIGHT. FOR NOW HAVE FOLLOWED SLIGHTLY CLOSER TO THE NAM12/ECMWF SOLUTIONS OVER THE GFS...SHOWING THE FRONT WILL BE CLOSE OR INTO THE CWA WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. BACKED FLOW...MOISTURE POOLING...WEAKENING CAP AND THE FRONT SHOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN POPS...ESPECIALLY NORTHERN AND WESTERN AREAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND SOUTHERN AND WESTERN AREAS THURSDAY.  CONFIDENCE IS EVEN LOWER THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY ON WHERE FRONT STALLS AND WHEN IT EVENTUALLY LIFTS BACK NORTH. AGAIN...CONVECTIVE OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WILL LIKELY PLAY A ROLE IN THIS. TIMING OF ANY DISTURBANCES ALSO IN THE APPROACHING ACTIVE SUB-TROPICAL BRANCH OF THE JET STREAM ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PINPOINT THIS FAR OUT. BUT GENERALLY CONTINUED SCATTERED POPS IN THE FORECAST THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. TEMPERATURES ALSO TRICKY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY... AND MAY HAVE TO BE LOWERED IN FUTURE PACKAGES ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS FOR THURSDAY IF FRONT IS FARTHER SOUTH.  EVENTUALLY THE SECOND UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER CALIFORNIA OPENS AND MOVES EAST FRIDAY AND INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND TEXAS OVER THE WEEKEND. BOTH THE ECMWF AND GFS ARE INDICATE ANOTHER GOOD SHOT OF PRECIP SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.  
CLUSTER OF THUNDERSTORMS THIS MORNING CONTINUES TO MOVE NORTH AND EAST AWAY FROM THE AREA. IT DID SEND A RATHER SUBSTANTIAL OUTFLOW BOUNDARY NORTHWARD AND WE WILL HAVE TO SEE IF THAT COMES IN TO PLAY THIS AFTERNOON FOR ADDITIONAL CONVECTIVE CHANCES. FOR NOW...HAVE NUDGED POPS NORTHWARD THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON WITH MAINLY DIURNAL ACTIVITY EXPECTED. BEST CHANCES WILL STILL BE OVER THE EAST AND SOUTHEAST COUNTIES.  DUNN  
/ISSUED 640 AM CDT MON MAY 18 2015/ THE PRIMARY AVIATION WEATHER CONCERN WITH THIS TAF PACKAGE WILL BE MORNING LOW CLOUDS AND FOG.  A LIGHT SOUTH WIND...MOSTLY CLEAR SKY AND VERY MOIST GROUND HAS RESULTED IN SOME PATCHY DENSE FOG ACROSS NORTH TEXAS EARLY THIS MORNING. THE DENSE FOG IS VERY SHALLOW AND SHOULD AFFECT LOCATIONS PRIMARILY WEST OF THE TAF SITES. HOWEVER...SOME TEMPORARY MVFR CEILINGS AND VISIBILITIES ARE POSSIBLE THROUGH 10 AM...ESPECIALLY IN WACO. ALL CONDITIONS SHOULD IMPROVE TO VFR BY MIDDAY AND REMAIN VFR THROUGH THE NIGHT. BRIEF MVFR CEILINGS MAY RETURN TO ALL TAF SITES AROUND SUNRISE TUESDAY.  IT APPEARS THAT THE BEST THUNDERSTORM CHANCES TODAY WILL BE WELL TO THE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST OF THE TAF SITES IN THE VICINITY OF A WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY AND A LIFTING SHORTWAVE. THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD DEVELOP ACROSS WEST TEXAS OVERNIGHT AND MOVE EASTWARD... BUT THESE SHOULD REMAIN WELL WEST OF THE NORTH TEXAS TERMINALS UNTIL TUESDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING.  A SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST WIND WILL PREVAIL THROUGH TONIGHT AT SPEEDS GENERALLY LESS THAN 12 KNOTS.  79   
ADDED PATCHY FOG ACROSS THE CWA THROUGH 9 AM. 75  
LATEST IR SATELLITE IMAGERY IS SHOWING STEADY CLOUD TOP WARMING OF THIS MORNING`S SOUTHEAST TEXAS MCS. ESTIMATED RAINFALL RATES HAVE BEEN TRENDING DOWNWARD TOO...AND IT LOOKS LIKE A NEW MCS IN SHREVEPORT`S CWA WILL BE THE FOCUS FOR A MAJORITY OF THE HEAVIEST RAINFALL FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS. BACK IN OUR AREA...RADAR HAS ESTIMATED OVERNIGHT THROUGH EARLY MORNING RAINFALL TOTALS OF 5 TO 10 INCHES FROM SOUTHERN GRIMES COUNTY TO NORTHWEST AUSTIN COUNTY TO NORTHERN COLORADO COUNTY... OR ROUGHLY FROM NAVASOTA TO JUST WEST OF BELLVILLE TO NORTH OF COLUMBUS. LATEST FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE HAS COME IN WITH EXTREMELY LOW ONE HOUR RAINFALL RATES OF 1 INCH IN WASHINGTON COUNTY...1.6 INCHES IN GRIMES COUNTY...AND 1.7 INCHES IN AUSTIN COUNTY. SOME OF OUR HEAVIER RECENT RAIN EVENTS HAVE GIVEN US THESE AMOUNTS IN 30 MINUTES OR LESS! WILL THEREFORE CONTINUE THE FLASH FLOOD WATCH FOR AREAS GENERALLY ALONG AND NORTH OF A LINE FROM COLUMBUS TO KATY TO LIVINGSTON WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ANY DAYTIME HEATING THAT DEVELOPS THIS AFTERNOON COULD SET OFF ANOTHER ROUND OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON ALREADY SATURATED GROUNDS. 42 
DISCUSSION... NOW GETTING RATES >2"/HR. THIS WILL LIKELY CAUSE SOME FF ISSUES AND ISSUED A FLASH FLOOD WATCH GENERALLY NORTH OF A COLUMBUS-LIVINGSTON LINE. HARRIS IS NOT INCLUDED ATTM BUT WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE TRENDS. 47  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 426 AM CDT MON MAY 18 2015/ SFC ANALYSIS STILL SHOWS A REMNANT BOUNDARY SITUATED FROM ROUGHLY LIVINGSTON TO COLUMBUS. HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN PRECIP COVERAGE ALONG THIS FEATURE IN THE PAST HOUR AS SLY LLVL FLOW FROM THE GULF FEEDS INTO IT. PW`S AROUND 2" ARE IN THE REGION AND UPPER FLOW IS NOTICEABLY DIFFLUENT OVER SAME BOUNDARY. W/V IMAGERY ALSO SHOWS SOME WEAK IMPULSES EMBEDDED IN THE FLOW ALOFT APPROACHING FROM S TX. ANTICIPATE CONTINUED INCREASE IN PRECIP COVERAGE THRU THE MORNING WITH A FAVORABLE PATTERN FOR REGENERATING/TRAINING LOCALIZED CLUSTERS OF RAINFALL - SOME LOCALLY HEAVY. STILL CONTEMPLATING A FFA AND MIGHT PULL THE TRIGGER LATER THIS MORNING AFTER KEEPING EYE ON TRENDS FOR A WHILE. GUIDANCE SUGGEST 2-2.5" COULD CAUSE PROBLEMS IF IT WERE TO FALL IN AN HOUR, 2.8-3.3 IN 3 HOURS. THINK WE`LL NEED TO WATCH FOR COVERAGE TO FILL IN SOUTH OF THE SFC BOUNDARY THIS MORNING AND AFTERNOON WITH DAYTIME HEATING. PRECIP SHOULD TAPER OFF W/ LOSS OF HEATING TONIGHT.  TROF CURRENTLY OVER CA WILL KICK OUT AND INTO NCNTL PLAINS ON TUE AND ITS REPLACEMENT WILL DROP BACK INTO PLACE MID/LATE WEEK. ALTHOUGH SLIGHT H5 RIDGING IS EXPECTED TO NOSE INTO THE AREA FROM MEXICO & GULF AS THIS OCCURS...STILL ANTICIPATE DAILY SCT SHRA/TSTMS WITH HEATING.  THINGS GET INTERESTING AGAIN BY THURS AS MOST MODELS (W/ EXCEPTION OF GFS) BRING A FRONT INTO THE REGION & PROVIDE ANOTHER BOUNDARY TO WORK WITH. UNSETTLED WX WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE INTO MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND (ESP SUN/MON) AS WESTERN TROF APPROACHES. 47  MARINE... ONSHORE WINDS HAVE WEAKENED A BIT THIS MORNING BUT EXPECTING THEM TO PICK UP AGAIN LATER THIS MORNING AS PCPN OVER INLAND SE TX BEGINS TO FILL IN. WILL BE KEEPING THE SCEC UP FOR THE OFFSHORE WATERS FOR TO- DAY. OTHERWISE NO REAL CHANGE WITH THE FCST OF MOSTLY LIGHT/MODERATE WINDS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDING OVER THE SRN ROCKIES WILL HELP TO PUSH A WEAK COLD FRONT INTO SE TX EARLY THU. AT THIS TIME...NOT EXPECTING A WIND SHIFT FOR THE BAYS/NEARSHORE WATERS BUT WE COULD SEE A MORE ELY COMPONENT TO THE WINDS DURING THIS TIME- FRAME. 41  AVIATION... A STRONGLY DIFFLUENT PATTERN ALOFT COMBINED WITH DISTURBANCES MOVING IN FROM THE WEST AND A LINGERING OUTFLOW BOUNDARY SHOULD ALLOW FOR A GRADUAL INCREASE OF ACTIVITY ON THE RADAR ACROSS SE TX THRU THE REST OF THIS MORNING. WILL LIKELY BE ADDING THE MENTION OF VCTS/TEMPOS TO SITES NORTH OF I-10 WITH AMDS SHORTLY. OTHERWISE WILL KEEP WITH MVFR CIGS THIS AFTN...POSSIBLY IFR CIGS TONIGHT. 41   
TX...FLASH FLOOD WATCH UNTIL 4 PM CDT THIS AFTERNOON FOR THE      FOLLOWING ZONES: AUSTIN...BRAZOS...BURLESON...COLORADO...      GRIMES...HARRIS...HOUSTON...MADISON...MONTGOMERY...POLK...      SAN JACINTO...TRINITY...WALKER...WALLER...WASHINGTON.  GM...SMALL CRAFT SHOULD EXERCISE CAUTION UNTIL 4 PM CDT THIS      AFTERNOON FOR THE FOLLOWING ZONES: WATERS FROM FREEPORT TO      THE MATAGORDA SHIP CHANNEL 20 NM TO 60 NM...WATERS FROM      HIGH ISLAND TO FREEPORT 20 TO 60 NM.  
THE PRIMARY AVIATION WEATHER CONCERN WITH THIS TAF PACKAGE WILL BE MORNING LOW CLOUDS AND FOG.  A LIGHT SOUTH WIND...MOSTLY CLEAR SKY AND VERY MOIST GROUND HAS RESULTED IN SOME PATCHY DENSE FOG ACROSS NORTH TEXAS EARLY THIS MORNING. THE DENSE FOG IS VERY SHALLOW AND SHOULD AFFECT LOCATIONS PRIMARILY WEST OF THE TAF SITES. HOWEVER...SOME TEMPORARY MVFR CEILINGS AND VISIBILITIES ARE POSSIBLE THROUGH 10 AM...ESPECIALLY IN WACO. ALL CONDITIONS SHOULD IMPROVE TO VFR BY MIDDAY AND REMAIN VFR THROUGH THE NIGHT. BRIEF MVFR CEILINGS MAY RETURN TO ALL TAF SITES AROUND SUNRISE TUESDAY.  IT APPEARS THAT THE BEST THUNDERSTORM CHANCES TODAY WILL BE WELL TO THE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST OF THE TAF SITES IN THE VICINITY OF A WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY AND A LIFTING SHORTWAVE. THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD DEVELOP ACROSS WEST TEXAS OVERNIGHT AND MOVE EASTWARD... BUT THESE SHOULD REMAIN WELL WEST OF THE NORTH TEXAS TERMINALS UNTIL TUESDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING.  A SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST WIND WILL PREVAIL THROUGH TONIGHT AT SPEEDS GENERALLY LESS THAN 12 KNOTS.  79  
MORNING. CONVECTION NORTH OF VCT SHOULD CONTINUE AN EAST-NORTHEAST MOVEMENT AWAY FROM VCT...HOWEVER ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL STILL REMAIN POSSIBLE AROUND VCT. WILL CONTINUE TO EXPECTED ISOLATED CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON BUT NOT ENOUGH TO MENTION IN TAFS. BREEZY CONDITIONS WILL DEVELOP WITH GUSTS OF 20-25KTS FROM CRP- ALI-VCT. A RETURN OF MVFR CIGS IS EXPECTED LATE THIS EVENING.  
SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...CONVECTION DEVELOPING ALONG THETA-E RIDGE AND LEFT OVER BOUNDARIES NORTH OF THE CWA. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE PUMPED INTO THE REGION WITH EXTRA CONVERGENCE ACROSS THE NORTHERN AND NORTHEASTERN AREAS VIA AN INVERTED TROUGH/LOW TO THE SOUTH. INSTABILITY IS AVAILABLE PER THE LAPS ANALYSIS AND IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN THROUGH THE REST OF TODAY. DESPITE A BROAD WEAK UPPER RIDGE IN PLACE EXTENDING FROM THE WESTERN GULF...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL REMAIN POSSIBLE TODAY. HOWEVER...THE BEST DYNAMICS REMAIN WELL TO THE NORTH OF THE CWA AS THE UPPER JET SPLITS CREATING A BETTER DIFLUENT FLOW ALOFT. H85 TEMPS CONTINUE TO RUN 16C-18C ACROSS THE AREA...WHICH IS WARM BUT NOT TOO STRONG TO HINDER ANY DEVELOPMENT FROM BACKBUILDING INTO THE NORTHERN ZONES. WITH THE BETTER DYNAMICS LIFTING NORTH THROUGH THE DAY...ISOLATED CONVECTION REMAINS POSSIBLE INTO THE AFTERNOON ACROSS THE INLAND AND WESTERN AREAS WITH DAYTIME HEATING. FOCUS SHIFTS WEST THIS EVENING AS A MIDLEVEL SHORTWAVE HELPS INITIATE ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE SIERRA MADRE WHICH MAY NEAR THE WESTERN ZONES. TUESDAY SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY QUIETER WITH MORNING STREAMER SHOWERS TRANSITIONING TO ISOLATED INLAND DEVELOPMENT DUE TO DAYTIME HEATING.  LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SOUTH TEXAS WILL BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE RIDGE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...KEEPING MOST OF THE AREA DRY. THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT CHANCE STORMS WILL AFFECT THE NORTHWESTERN BRUSH COUNTRY TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. 00Z ECMWF CONTINUES TO DEPICT A COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH NORTH TEXAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND STALLING OVER SOUTH-CENTRAL TEXAS THURSDAY EVENING. POTENTIAL FOR MCS TO FORM OVER THE BIG COUNTRY AND BACKBUILD TO SOUTHWEST INTO THE WESTERN HILL COUNTRY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS REGION OF LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE WITH THE FRONT IS IN PROXIMITY WITH DIFLUENT FLOW ALOFT DOWNSTREAM FROM THE NEXT UPPER LOW MOVING INTO CALIFORNIA. EXPECT A GOOD CHANCE THE MCS WILL MOVE TOWARD REGION ON THURSDAY AS THE FRONT STALLS NORTH OF THE AREA. WILL CONTINUE TO SHOW GOOD CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY. A STRONG SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE NORTHEAST FROM NORTHEAST MEXICO TO CENTRAL TEXAS THURSDAY NIGHT. WILL SHOW GOOD CHANCE POPS OVER THE BRUSH COUNTRY FOR THURSDAY NIGHT. THE FRONT WILL LIFT NORTH BY FRIDAY WITH A LITTLE LOWER CHANCE FOR RAIN FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. ACTIVE PATTERN OF STORM SYSTEMS MOVING OUT OF THE DESERT SOUTHWEST THROUGH THE ROCKIES REPEATS AGAIN LATE WEEK. THE NEXT UPPER LOW WILL BE OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FRIDAY MORNING AND MOVE ACROSS THE FOUR CORNERS REGION SATURDAY AND INTO THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS SUNDAY. ECMWF SHOWS THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS EXTENDING SOUTHWEST INTO NORTHWEST MEXICO FOR SATURDAY AND MOVING TOWARD SOUTH TEXAS ON SUNDAY. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES MAY BE UP AROUND 2 INCHES AGAIN BY THE WEEKEND LEADING TO ANOTHER POTENTIAL ROUND OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.  
HAVE INCREASE CLOUDS ACROSS THE CWA FOR TODAY. LOW CLOUDS HAVE ALREADY SPREAD OVER PARTS OF THE WESTERN COUNTIES AND WILL MOVE OF MUCH OF THE CWA THIS MORNING. 75  
12Z TAFS...VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON. A COLD FRONT CURRENTLY DRAPED OVER THE OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE WILL DRIFT SOUTHWARD AND WILL CONTINUE TURNING WINDS NORTH THIS MORNING...THEN SOUTHEASTERLY BEHIND IT THIS AFTERNOON. MVFR TO LOW-VFR CEILINGS WILL DEVELOP AFTER 00Z...AND SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OVER THE WESTERN PANHANDLES TONIGHT AND SPREAD NORTHEASTWARD DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. IFR CONDITIONS WILL BE LIKELY DURING PERIODS OF HEAVIER RAIN AND POSSIBLY PREDOMINANT BY THE END OF THIS TAF CYCLE.  ELSENHEIMER  
DISCUSSION... THE VERY WET PATTERN WILL CONTINUE THIS WEEK BEFORE POSSIBLY SHOWING SOME SIGNS OF BREAKING DOWN NEXT WEEK. A SPLIT FLOW UPPER LEVEL PATTERN WILL PERSIST THIS WEEK WITH A STRONGER THAN NORMAL SRN STREAM FEATURING EMBEDDED SHORTWAVE TROFS OR CLOSED LOWS.  THE NEXT CLOSED LOW IN THE SEEMINGLY ENDLESS SERIES WAS SITUATED NEAR THE CNTRL CA COAST EARLY THIS MORNING. THIS STORM SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO ROTATE NEWD TOWARDS WY BY LATE TUESDAY AFTERNOON...THEN OVER THE NRN PLAINS BY WED MORNING AND WEAKEN FURTHER. A SFC COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE MOVG SLOWLY ACROSS THE TX AND OK PNHDLS TODAY AND SETTLE SOUTH OF THE FCST AREA. BEHIND THIS BOUNDARY...EAST TO SE LOW LEVEL MOIST UPSLOPE FLOW WILL COMMENCE TODAY ACROSS THE REGION. AS THE UPPER LEVEL STORM SYSTEM BEGINS MOVG ENE THROUGH TONIGHT AND TUE...THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL BECOME MORE DIFFLUENT ACROSS THE SRN HIGH PLAINS DURG THIS PERIOD. ALL THIS...COUPLED WITH INCREASING LIFT FROM THE UPPER LEVEL STORM SYSTEM AND DEEP MOISTURE SUGGESTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND TSTMS TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY. HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE ACROSS THE FCST AREA TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. DECIDED TO MENTION THIS POTENTIAL IN THE WEATHER GRIDS AND PUBLIC PRODUCTS. CONTEMPLATED A FLOOD WATCH BUT WILL LET NEXT SHIFT EVALUATE FURTHER TODAY...AND ONE MAY BECOME NECESSARY FOR TONIGHT AND TUESDAY ACROSS PARTS IF NOT ALL THE FCST AREA. INCREASED POPS MORE TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...THEN TAPERED VALUES FROM WEST TO EAST TUE NIGHT AS THE STORM SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE NRN PLAINS AND WEAKENS. A REINFORCING SURGE OF COOLER AIR LOOKS PLAUSIBLE LATE TUE NIGHT AND WED. MODELS ARE DIVIDED ON HOW MUCH DRY AIR FILTERS IN FOR WED AND THURSDAY. HAVE COMPROMISED AND RESTRICTED POPS TO JUST SLGT CHC VALUES FOR PARTS OF THE AREA WED THRU THURSDAY.  FOR THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...THE NEXT CLOSED UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO DIG DOWN TO NEAR THE SRN CA COAST THURSDAY NIGHT...THEN HEAD TOWARDS THE FOUR CORNERS REGION BY SAT MORNING... AND FINALLY INTO THE CNTRL PLAINS BY SUNDAY MORNING. MOISTURE WILL RAPIDLY RETURN THURSDAY NIGHT FOR THIS STORM SYSTEM TO UTILIZE...AND HAVE RAISED POPS SOME FOR THU NIGHT THRU FRI NIGHT. AS THIS UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVES CLOSER SATURDAY...POPS WERE FASHIONED IN A GRADIENT WITH SLGT CHC VALUES WRN ZONES...INCREASING TO HIGH CHC ERN ZONES. POPS WERE THEN RESTRICTED TO JUST THE ERN ZONES SATURDAY NIGHT. DRY WEATHER THEN RETURNS FOR NEXT SUNDAY AND MONDAY AT THIS TIME.  ANDRADE  
VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED DURING THE DAY...BUT WILL DETERIORATE TO MVFR DECKS AND VIS COURTESY OF INCREASING CHANCES OF THUNDERSTORMS THIS EVENING THROUGH TONIGHT. HAVE INSERTING A PREVAILING TSRA AT ALL THREE TAF SITES...COMMENCING THIS EVENING AT KLBB AND KPVW...AND MORE SO BY TONIGHT AT KCDS. RAINFALL COULD BECOME HEAVY AT TIMES. OTHERWISE...LIGHT SOUTHWEST WINDS EARLY THIS MORNING WILL BACK TO THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST THIS AFTERNOON AT 10-15 KTS.  
SHORT TERM... THE SHORT TERM PERIOD WILL FOCUS ON THE RETURN OF SCATTERED TO WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...THAT COULD COMMENCE AS EARLY AS LATE THIS AFTN.  THE PACIFIC FRONT/DRYLINE THAT AFFECTED THE SOUTHERN PLAINS YESTERDAY WAS WELL SOUTH AND EAST OF THE CWA EARLY THIS MORNING...AS HINTED AT BY DEWPOINTS IN THE 60S AND 70S ACROSS THE CONCHO VALLEY...BIG COUNTRY AND EDWARDS PLATEAU AREAS. AS SUCH...SOME FOG AND/OR LOW CLOUDS HAVE DEVELOPED ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE SAID AREAS. COMPUTER MODELS HINT AT THE BOUNDARY RETREATING TO NEAR THE FAR SRN SOUTH PLAINS AND LOW ROLLING PLAINS BY AOA DAYBREAK...BRINGING WITH IT RICH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND A CHANCE FOR THE FOG AND/OR STRATUS DECK TO MAKE HEADWAY TOWARDS THE FA. HOWEVER...MODEL SOLUTIONS SUCH AS THE HRRR AND THE NAM EXHIBIT THE FOG AND LOW CLOUDS TO STOP JUST SHORT OF THE FA AND DISSIPATE...GIVEN SFC WINDS VEERING TO THE W-SW THROUGHOUT DAYBREAK AND THUS MITIGATING THE TRANSPORT OF THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND SEE IF THIS DOES INDEED OCCUR.  ATTENTION WILL TURN TO AN UA LOW THAT WAS IMPINGING ON CNTRL/SRN CALI PER 07Z SATELLITE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY...AND IS PROGGED TO TRANSLATE ENE TO NEAR THE FOUR-CORNERS REGION BY TONIGHT. AS SUCH...SW FLOW ALOFT WILL SHARPEN. EMBEDDED WITHIN THIS SW FLOW IS AN IMPULSE THAT MODEL SOLUTIONS SHOW EJECTING OUT AHEAD OF THE PARENT UA LOW...AND NEAR THE SWRN ZONES LATE THIS AFTN/EARLY EVENING AND PROGRESS TO THE NE TO ACROSS THE NERN ZONES BY TONIGHT. WITH SFC LEE TROUGHING DEEPENING DUE TO THE APPROACHING UA LOW...THIS WILL AID TO BACK SFC WINDS TO THE S-SE AND PWATS WILL SOAR INTO THE 1.00- 1.50 INCH RANGE BY TONIGHT...WHILST THE LLJ CRANKS UP TO 20-40 KTS. WITH ALL THAT SAID...CONVECTION IS STILL EXPECTED TO INITIATE ACROSS THE FAR SW SOUTH PLAINS AS EARLY AS LATE THIS AFTN/EARLY THIS EVENING...ESPECIALLY IF THE TIMING OF THE ANTICIPATED EMBEDDED IMPULSE STAYS TRUE. PRECIP WILL BECOME SCATTERED TO PERHAPS WIDESPREAD AS IT PROGRESSES NE TO ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF THE CWA THROUGH THE NIGHT. TO ADD FUEL TO THE PROVERBIAL FIRE...A COLD FRONT WILL BACKDOOR INTO THE REGION THIS EVENING/TONIGHT...WHICH COULD SERVE AS ANOTHER FOCUS FOR STORM DEVELOPMENT. WITH SUCH HIGH PWATS...MODERATE-HEAVY RAINFALL CAN NOT BE RULED OUT WHICH RAISES CONCERNS FOR LOCALIZED FLOODED. WE ALSO NEED TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR SOME STORMS BECOMING STRONG TO SEVERE...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SWRN ZONES LATE THIS AFTN AS PROGGED MUCAPE VALUES OF 2-3 KJ/KG...30-40 KTS OF 0-6 KM BULK SHEAR...STEEPENED LAPSE RATES AND VEERING WIND PROFILES SAYS AS MUCH /HAIL AND GUSTY WINDS WILL BE THE PRIMARY THREATS/.  A SEASONABLY WARM DAY WILL PREVAIL WITH HIGHS IN THE 70S AND 80S...FOLLOWED BY OVERNIGHT LOWS IN THE 50S AND 60S.  LONG TERM... THE WEATHER FOR THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS /MINUS THE WIND AND LACK OF 70+ DEGREE DEW POINTS/ HAVE MADE IT FEEL LIKE I AM BACK IN MY OLD STOMPING GROUNDS IN SOUTH MS...AND IT DOESN/T LOOK LIKE THE PATTERN WILL CHANGE ANY OVER THE NEXT 7 DAYS AND BEYOND. FOR STARTERS WPC QPF GUIDANCE PRE 00Z SHOWS UPWARDS OF 5 INCHES OF RAIN OVER THE NEXT 7 DAYS. TUESDAY MORNING WILL START VERY WET WITH AN UPPER LEVEL LOW WITH A SLIGHT NEG TILT MOVES OVER NV TOWARDS THE REGION. MODEL OMEGA FIELDS/SOUNDING PROFILES ALL SHOW LIFT AND NO SUBSIDENCE BY 7AM THOUGH THEY DO VARY ON THE AMOUNT OF LIFT. THE GFS HAS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF LIFT WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF QPF WHILE THE NAM/ECMWF ARE FAIRLY IN LINE WITH EACH OTHER. PWAT VALUES WILL BE RELATIVELY HIGH...1.25 TO 1.5 INCHES ON THE CAPROCK WHILE APPROACHING 2 INCHES ACROSS THE EASTER ROLLING PLAINS. THIS IS IN PART DUE TO MOIST SURFACE CONDITIONS AS WELL AS A 40KT LLJ PUMPING IN MOISTURE FROM THE GOMEX. ONE CONCERN WITH TUESDAY MORNING WILL BE FLOODING. WITH ALREADY SATURATED SOILS AND FULL PLAYA LAKES RUN OFF...MAINLY IN URBAN AREAS...WILL BE ALL BUT GUARANTEED WITH A QUICK 1 INCH RAINFALL CAUSING PROBLEMS. WHILE ACTUAL RAINFALL AMOUNTS AS WELL AS THE LOCATION OF THE HEAVIEST RAIN IS HARD TO PINPOINT NEARLY 24 HOURS OUT...THE EXPECTED WIDESPREAD DYNAMIC LIFT IN ADDITION TO THE RICH MOISTURE TRANSPORT VIA THE LLJ SHOWS THAT HEAVY RAIN MAY BE FAIRLY WIDESPREAD. GIVEN THAT THIS IS EXPECTED TO HAPPEN DURING THE MORNING TRAFFIC RUSH AN AREAL FLOOD WATCH MAY BE WARRANTED. FOR NOW WE WILL DEFER THE WATCH DECISION TO THE NEXT SHIFT FOR FURTHER EVALUATION OF MORE UP TO DATE INFO. THERE IS A POSSIBLE SEVERE THREAT LATER TOMORROW AFTERNOON/EVENING DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH SURFACE HEATING CAN BE ACHIEVED. THIS WILL BE DEPENDENT ON CLOUD COVER. AS OF NOW OUR WESTERN ZONES HAVE SOMEWHAT HIGHER CHANCES TO SEE SEVERE STORMS THAN THE REST OF THE FA AS CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO THIN FROM WEST TO EAST.  WE SHOULD SEE PRECIP MOVE OFF TO THE EAST BY WED MORNING AS A FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE NORTH. MODEL TIMING WITH THE FROPA DIFFERS WITH THE GFS /FRONT PUSHING INTO OUR NORTHERN ZONES BY 00Z THURS/ BEING SLOWER THAN THE ECMWF /FRONT THRU THE FA BY 00Z/. OTHER THAN A WIND SHIFT AND CLOUD COVER THIS SHOULDN/T CREATE MUCH OF A HEADACHE AS FAR AS THE FORECAST IS CONCERNED. THE FROPA WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A LOW STRATUS DECK THAT WILL STICK AROUND FOR MUCH OF WED NIGHT INTO THURS AFTERNOON. RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE MAINLY DUE TO ISENTROPIC LIFTING. THE BIGGEST CHANGE TO THE FORECAST DURING THIS PERIOD IS MAKING THE PRECIP MAINLY IN THE FORM OF RAIN WITH A MENTION OF ISO THUNDER AS THE CHANCE EXISTS FOR SOME ELEVATED CAPE. ANOTHER LOW IS PROGGED TO MOVE INLAND ACROSS SOCAL WHICH WILL RETURN SURFACE FLOW OUT OF THE SOUTH/SOUTHEAST AND SET UP A DRYLINE OVER CENTRAL NM. THIS WILL BE OUR NEXT BIG RAIN MAKER AS THE DRYLINE PUSHES EASTWARD AND THEN RETREATS FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.  TEMPS WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN BELOW SEASONAL AVERAGE AS CLOUD COVER WILL BE ABUNDANT THRU THE WEEK AND SURFACE MOISTURE WILL HELP MODERATE SURFACE TEMPS. THURS WILL BE PARTICULARLY CHILLY WITH TEMPS AVERAGING 20 DEGREES BELOW SEASONAL AVERAGE /MID 60S/ DUE TO SURFACE CAA ASSOCIATED WITH THE FROPA. ALDRICH  
See aviation discussion below.  
Gulf moisture will continue to push northwestward this morning on increasing southeast winds. Expecting TEMPO MVFR conditions at KMAF, KINK, and KHOB through 16z as occasional Gulf stratus tracks across those terminals. A strong upper level disturbance will bring a good chance of thunderstorms to a majority of the terminals by late this afternoon through tonight. Included a TEMPO group for MVFR/VFR conditions in thunderstorms at most terminals in the 20z- 24z timeframe this afternoon. Scattered to numerous thunderstorms are expected tonight at most terminals and have included a PREVAILING group for this activity beginning at 00z Tuesday at KMAF, KINK, and KHOB, with TEMPO groups at KCNM, KPEQ, and PROB30 groups at KFST. Expect southeast winds to increase to 15 to 25 mph and gusty by mid morning and continue through this afternoon and tonight.    
DISCUSSION... Satellite and observations are showing low clouds and dewpoints in the upper 60s in the lower Trans Pecos beginning to surge northwestward into the Permian Basin this morning. This moisture will push up against the Guadalupe and Davis Mountains this afternoon where daytime heating and an appropriately timed weak upper trough will initiate convection. CAPE and shear will be more than enough to support severe convection and SPC has almost the entire area outlooked in a slight risk for severe thunderstorms with large hail the main threat...but strong winds, and even isolated tornadoes will also be possible.  Tuesday will see another round of convection with increasing southwesterly flow ahead of an upper low over the Four Corners developing a dryline over the western Permian Basin. Instability will not be as high as today but again it should be enough to support severe thunderstorms and once again the Permian Basin is outlooked by SPC with a slight risk.  Things change a bit Wednesday with the approach of a weak cold front. How far south the front pushes during the day on Wednesday will affect thunderstorm potential...an earlier arrival will bring cooler air in quicker and limit instability while a later arrival will allow for better daytime heating and more instability. The NAM is fastest with the timing of the front...and is normally preferred in these situations due to its higher low level resolution with the other models having a slower passage after sunset. Despite this will go with model consensus and not bring the front through Midland before peak heating at this time but will have it entering the northeastern Basin with a good temperature gradient from northeast to southwest. The front will definitely be through by Thursday and cloudy skies and overrunning precipitation will combine with the weak cold air advection to drop temperatures well below normal.  Friday skies begin to clear out and afternoon heating will again cause instability and keep thunderstorm chances in the forecast through the weekend.  Hennig  
WITH HAZE IS CURRENTLY ACROSS THE AREA. THE HAZE WILL REMAIN THROUGH THE DAY DUE TO AGRICULTURAL BURNING IN MEXICO BUT VIS WILL BE LOWER EARLY THIS MORNING DUE LIGHT WIND AND LOW MIXING. EXPECT VFR CONDITIONS THROUGH THE DAY WITH MIX OF CU CLOUDS AND SUN. DRY AIR COMING FROM THE GULF WILL STABILIZE THE ATMOSPHERE ENOUGH TO LIMIT CONVECTION TODAY. THE WINDS WILL PICK UP WITH DAYTIME MIXING WITH GUSTS UP 20 TO 25 KNOTS BUT WILL DECOUPLE THIS EVENING. CLOUDS RETURN OVERNIGHT WITH INVERSION DEVELOPING AND CEILINGS AROUND 2000 FEET.  
SHORT TERM /NOW THROUGH TUESDAY/...UPPER LEVEL LOW ENTERING NORTHERN CA WILL CONTINUE ITS TRACK EAST/NORTHEAST OVER THE GREAT BASIN MONDAY WHILE WEAK RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS. THIS WILL PROVIDE A MORE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT ACROSS SOUTH TX WHILE SOME PERTURBATIONS MOVE ACROSS THE MEAN FLOW. THE SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW IN THE LOWER LEVELS WILL BRING SLIGHT DRIER AIR INTO THE AREA WHILE THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAIN NEAR THE SIERRA MADRE WHERE THE CONVECTION WILL BE CONCENTRATED DURING THE DAY. THE ACTIVITY SHOULD REMAIN WEST OF THE CWA NOT IMPACTING THE WESTERN COUNTIES BY THE AFTERNOON HOURS. THERE WILL BE A MIX OF SUN AND CLOUDS AS THE DRY AIR MIXES NOT ALLOWING FOR MUCH CONVECTION OVER THE RGV. TEMPERATURES WILL RISE TO NEAR 90S ACROSS THE CWA AND MID 80S NEAR THE COASTAL AREAS.  TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...AS THE LOW PRESSURE MOVES NORTHEAST...A FRONT MOVES SOUTH OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. THE FRONT REMAINS NORTH OF THE AREA WHILE SE FLOW BRINGS DEEP MOISTURE AHEAD OF IT. CLOUD COVER WILL INCREASE TONIGHT WITH BKN TO OVERCAST CEILINGS WHILE WINDS DECOUPLED. LOW TEMPERATURES WILL RANGE BETWEEN THE MID TO UPPER 70S WITH HUMID CONDITIONS. INTO TUESDAY... GRADIENT WILL STRENGTHEN INCREASING SE WINDS TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING AS HIGH PRESSURE INTERACTS WITH LEE TROUGH ALONG THE SIERRA MADRE. CONVECTION WILL HAVE A SIMILAR TREND AS MONDAY WITH MOST OF THE ACTIVITY REMAINING TO THE WEST NEAR THE SIERRA MADRE WITH NO MUCH ACTIVITY EXPECTED OVER THE CWA.  LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...DEEP SOUTH TEXAS AND THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY ON THE NORTHERN FRINGE OF 500 MB HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER CENTRAL MEXICO WILL PRODUCE DRY WEATHER FOR TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM NEIGHBORING MEXICO MAY AFFECT THE WESTERN AND/OR NORTHERN HALF OF THE BRO CWFA WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY AS THE HIGH DAMPENS AND THE MID-LEVEL FLOW OVERHEAD BECOMES ORIENTED MORE OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST. DRY WEATHER MAY BRIEFLY RETURN FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY AS PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES DROP SLIGHTLY AND THE ATMOSPHERE BECOME MORE DRY. HOWEVER...CONVECTION IS FORECAST TO INCREASE IN COVERAGE SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY AS THE ATMOSPHERE MOISTENS AGAIN AND MORE SIGNIFICANT 500 MB DISTURBANCES PASS OVERHEAD. WITH NO SIGNIFICANT WEATHER SYSTEMS LIKELY TO AFFECT THE BRO CWFA...DAYTIME AND OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY PREVAIL AT ABOVE NORMAL LEVELS.  MARINE...NOW THROUGH TUESDAY...PRESSURE GRADIENT STRENGTHENING ACROSS THE GULF COAST WILL INCREASE SE WINDS THIS AFTERNOON BECOMING EASTERLY TONIGHT. SEAS WILL INCREASE CLOSE TO 6 FEET AND REMAIN BELOW SCEC LEVEL THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. DRY AIR IN THE AREA WILL LIMIT THE POTENTIAL FOR CONVECTION IN THE SHORT TERM.  TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...GENERALLY MODERATE WINDS AND SEAS...WITH POSSIBLE PERIODIC SMALL CRAFT EXERCISE CAUTION...ARE EXPECTED TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO INTERACTING WITH WEAK LOW PRESSURE INLAND. WINDS AND SEAS MAY APPROACH SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CRITERIA SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY AS THE HIGH/LOW PRESSURE INTERACTION INTENSIFIES.  
/12Z TAFS/  MVFR/IFR ceilings will continue at all sites, then become VFR by late morning or early afternoon. Isolated to scattered showers and thunderstorms will be possible this afternoon. A VCTS group was included at all sites, except KABI. Showers and thunderstorms across West Texas may affect the terminals late this evening or early Tuesday morning, but confidence is not high enough to include in the current TAF package. A return of MVFR ceilings is forecast by late this evening or early Tuesday morning.  
SHORT TERM... (Today and Tonight)  Near normal temperatures can be expected this afternoon with highs mainly in the upper 80s. Abundant low level moisture will be present today, with dewpoint temperatures in the mid to upper 60s. As we heat up this afternoon, high resolution models are hinting that we should break the cap to allow for at least isolated to scattered showers and thunderstorms this afternoon, mainly across the southern two thirds of the region. At the same time, an upper level disturbance will approach from northern Mexico, resulting in showers and thunderstorms over West Texas/Big Bend Region. Some of this activity may move into at least the western counties of West Central Texas tonight, and this is where the highest PoPs were placed. Some of these storms may be strong to severe, although the severe threat will wane as we head into the late evening/early morning hours. Overnight lows will generally be in the mid 60s to near 70.  LONG TERM... (Tuesday through Monday)  Little change to the ongoing forecast, with rain chances persisting through much of the week. The overall upper level pattern of a trough over the western US and a ridge over the central or eastern US will continue, with southwest flow aloft across West Central Texas. Plenty of low level moisture in place with dewpoints in the 60s. Series of shortwaves will rotate through the main trough, creating the lift needed for convection. Always hard to pin down these waves much more than 48 hours in advance, so best rain chances will be Tuesday with models now consistent in forecasting one of these shortwave to pass just west of the area. As this wave passes, models push a cold front into the area for Wednesday Night and Thursday. Cooler air mass behind it, with highs as cool as the upper 60s for areas north and west of Abilene. This front will settle into the I-10 corridor and then begin to shift back northward as a warm front. Between the shortwaves rotating through aloft and the frontal boundary at the surface, have to continue at least scattered showers and thunderstorms every period through the end of the week and into the weekend.  
SHRA/TSRA ALL AREAS TODAY WILL SHIFT TO THE RIO GRANDE PLAINS AND EDWARDS TONIGHT...THEN EDWARDS PLATEAU...HILL COUNTRY AND AUSTIN AREA TUESDAY. ISOLD SHRA/TSRA ARE EXPECTED ELSEWHERE. FOR NOW... HAVE LEFT MENTION OUT OF TAFS AS PROBS ARE TOO LOW TO MENTION. IFR/MVFR CIGS LIFT TO VFR MIDDAY INTO AFTERNOON. MVFR CIGS RETURN THIS EVENING...THEN IFR OVERNIGHT AND BACK TO MVFR TUESDAY. PATCHY IFR/MVFR VSBYS IN BR ARE EXPECTED EARLY THIS MORNING AND OVERNIGHT TONIGHT AS WELL IN SHRA/TSRA. S TO SE WINDS 5 TO 15 KTS PREVAIL WITH GUSTS TO 25 KTS POSSIBLE.  
SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...WEAK MID LEVEL FORCING AND STRENGTHENING LOW LEVEL JET ARE CONTRIBUTING TO SCATTERED SHOWER AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT EARLY THIS MORNING. COVERAGE SHOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE THROUGH THE EARLY TO MID MORNING HOURS...EVENTUALLY FOCUSING MORE TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST CWA...NORTHEAST OF A SAN MARCOS TO HALLETTSVILLE LINE...AS MID LEVEL FLOW VEERS MORE SOUTHWEST AND SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR WORKS INTO THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES.  CONVECTION SHOULD ALSO FIRE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF MEXICO AND ACROSS THE BIG BEND AND WEST TEXAS NEAR THE DRY LINE. A FEW OF THESE STORMS COULD REACH WESTERN AREAS OF THE EDWARDS PLATEAU AND RIO GRANDE PLAINS THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. A STRONGER STORM OR TWO WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THIS REGION.  TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT THE UPPER LEVEL LOW CURRENTLY OVER CALIFORNIA WILL SHEAR NORTHEAST THROUGH THE ROCKIES. A LEAD MID AND UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE WILL PASS THROUGH WEST TEXAS AND THE PANHANDLE...AND INTO NORTH TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA. THE MAIN FORCING WILL PASS PRIMARILY NORTH OF THE CWA...BUT CLOSE ENOUGH FOR SCATTERED POPS NORTH OF A DEL RIO TO AUSTIN LINE ON TUESDAY.  LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL DEVELOP OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. INITIALLY SHOULD SEE A REDUCTION IN POPS ON WEDNESDAY WITH SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR IN PLACE...STRENGTHENING CAP...AND LACK OF FORCING.  FORECAST CONFIDENCE DECREASES WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY... DEPENDENT ON SOUTHWARD PROGRESSION OF A COLD FRONT. BOTH THE NAM12 AND ECMWF ARE STRONGER AND FARTHER SOUTH THAN THE GFS WITH A COLD FRONT THAT DROPS SOUTH BEHIND THE AFOREMENTIONED DEPARTING SHORTWAVE THROUGH THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TUESDAY NIGHT. BOTH HAVE THE FRONT ENTERING THE HILL COUNTRY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND BISECTING THE CWA BY 12Z THURSDAY. ORGANIZED CONVECTION AND ASSOCIATED OUTFLOW TO THE NORTH ON WEDNESDAY WILL LIKELY PLAY A ROLE ON HOW FAR SOUTH FRONT MAKES IT WEDNESDAY NIGHT. FOR NOW HAVE FOLLOWED SLIGHTLY CLOSER TO THE NAM12/ECMWF SOLUTIONS OVER THE GFS...SHOWING THE FRONT WILL BE CLOSE OR INTO THE CWA WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. BACKED FLOW...MOISTURE POOLING...WEAKENING CAP AND THE FRONT SHOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN POPS...ESPECIALLY NORTHERN AND WESTERN AREAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND SOUTHERN AND WESTERN AREAS THURSDAY.  CONFIDENCE IS EVEN LOWER THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY ON WHERE FRONT STALLS AND WHEN IT EVENTUALLY LIFTS BACK NORTH. AGAIN...CONVECTIVE OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WILL LIKELY PLAY A ROLE IN THIS. TIMING OF ANY DISTURBANCES ALSO IN THE APPROACHING ACTIVE SUB-TROPICAL BRANCH OF THE JET STREAM ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PINPOINT THIS FAR OUT. BUT GENERALLY CONTINUED SCATTERED POPS IN THE FORECAST THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. TEMPERATURES ALSO TRICKY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY... AND MAY HAVE TO BE LOWERED IN FUTURE PACKAGES ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS FOR THURSDAY IF FRONT IS FARTHER SOUTH.  EVENTUALLY THE SECOND UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER CALIFORNIA OPENS AND MOVES EAST FRIDAY AND INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND TEXAS OVER THE WEEKEND. BOTH THE ECMWF AND GFS ARE INDICATE ANOTHER GOOD SHOT OF PRECIP SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.  
NOW GETTING RATES >2"/HR. THIS WILL LIKELY CAUSE SOME FF ISSUES AND ISSUED A FLASH FLOOD WATCH GENERALLY NORTH OF A COLUMBUS-LIVINGSTON LINE. HARRIS IS NOT INCLUDED ATTM BUT WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE TRENDS. 47  
SFC ANALYSIS STILL SHOWS A REMNANT BOUNDARY SITUATED FROM ROUGHLY LIVINGSTON TO COLUMBUS. HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN PRECIP COVERAGE ALONG THIS FEATURE IN THE PAST HOUR AS SLY LLVL FLOW FROM THE GULF FEEDS INTO IT. PW`S AROUND 2" ARE IN THE REGION AND UPPER FLOW IS NOTICEABLY DIFFLUENT OVER SAME BOUNDARY. W/V IMAGERY ALSO SHOWS SOME WEAK IMPULSES EMBEDDED IN THE FLOW ALOFT APPROACHING FROM S TX. ANTICIPATE CONTINUED INCREASE IN PRECIP COVERAGE THRU THE MORNING WITH A FAVORABLE PATTERN FOR REGENERATING/TRAINING LOCALIZED CLUSTERS OF RAINFALL - SOME LOCALLY HEAVY. STILL CONTEMPLATING A FFA AND MIGHT PULL THE TRIGGER LATER THIS MORNING AFTER KEEPING EYE ON TRENDS FOR A WHILE. GUIDANCE SUGGEST 2-2.5" COULD CAUSE PROBLEMS IF IT WERE TO FALL IN AN HOUR, 2.8-3.3 IN 3 HOURS. THINK WE`LL NEED TO WATCH FOR COVERAGE TO FILL IN SOUTH OF THE SFC BOUNDARY THIS MORNING AND AFTERNOON WITH DAYTIME HEATING. PRECIP SHOULD TAPER OFF W/ LOSS OF HEATING TONIGHT.  TROF CURRENTLY OVER CA WILL KICK OUT AND INTO NCNTL PLAINS ON TUE AND ITS REPLACEMENT WILL DROP BACK INTO PLACE MID/LATE WEEK. ALTHOUGH SLIGHT H5 RIDGING IS EXPECTED TO NOSE INTO THE AREA FROM MEXICO & GULF AS THIS OCCURS...STILL ANTICIPATE DAILY SCT SHRA/TSTMS WITH HEATING.  THINGS GET INTERESTING AGAIN BY THURS AS MOST MODELS (W/ EXCEPTION OF GFS) BRING A FRONT INTO THE REGION & PROVIDE ANOTHER BOUNDARY TO WORK WITH. UNSETTLED WX WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE INTO MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND (ESP SUN/MON) AS WESTERN TROF APPROACHES. 47  MARINE... ONSHORE WINDS HAVE WEAKENED A BIT THIS MORNING BUT EXPECTING THEM TO PICK UP AGAIN LATER THIS MORNING AS PCPN OVER INLAND SE TX BEGINS TO FILL IN. WILL BE KEEPING THE SCEC UP FOR THE OFFSHORE WATERS FOR TO- DAY. OTHERWISE NO REAL CHANGE WITH THE FCST OF MOSTLY LIGHT/MODERATE WINDS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDING OVER THE SRN ROCKIES WILL HELP TO PUSH A WEAK COLD FRONT INTO SE TX EARLY THU. AT THIS TIME...NOT EXPECTING A WIND SHIFT FOR THE BAYS/NEARSHORE WATERS BUT WE COULD SEE A MORE ELY COMPONENT TO THE WINDS DURING THIS TIME- FRAME. 41  AVIATION... A STRONGLY DIFFLUENT PATTERN ALOFT COMBINED WITH DISTURBANCES MOVING IN FROM THE WEST AND A LINGERING OUTFLOW BOUNDARY SHOULD ALLOW FOR A GRADUAL INCREASE OF ACTIVITY ON THE RADAR ACROSS SE TX THRU THE REST OF THIS MORNING. WILL LIKELY BE ADDING THE MENTION OF VCTS/TEMPOS TO SITES NORTH OF I-10 WITH AMDS SHORTLY. OTHERWISE WILL KEEP WITH MVFR CIGS THIS AFTN...POSSIBLY IFR CIGS TONIGHT. 41   
TX...FLASH FLOOD WATCH UNTIL 4 PM CDT THIS AFTERNOON FOR THE      FOLLOWING ZONES: AUSTIN...BRAZOS...BURLESON...COLORADO...      GRIMES...HOUSTON...MADISON...MONTGOMERY...POLK...SAN      JACINTO...TRINITY...WALKER...WALLER...WASHINGTON.  GM...SMALL CRAFT SHOULD EXERCISE CAUTION UNTIL 4 PM CDT THIS      AFTERNOON FOR THE FOLLOWING ZONES: WATERS FROM FREEPORT TO      THE MATAGORDA SHIP CHANNEL 20 NM TO 60 NM...WATERS FROM      HIGH ISLAND TO FREEPORT 20 TO 60 NM.  
THETA-E RIDGE AND LEFT OVER BOUNDARIES NORTH OF THE CWA. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE PUMPED INTO THE REGION WITH EXTRA CONVERGENCE ACROSS THE NORTHERN AND NORTHEASTERN AREAS VIA AN INVERTED TROUGH/LOW TO THE SOUTH. INSTABILITY IS AVAILABLE PER THE LAPS ANALYSIS AND IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN THROUGH THE REST OF TODAY. DESPITE A BROAD WEAK UPPER RIDGE IN PLACE EXTENDING FROM THE WESTERN GULF...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL REMAIN POSSIBLE TODAY. HOWEVER...THE BEST DYNAMICS REMAIN WELL TO THE NORTH OF THE CWA AS THE UPPER JET SPLITS CREATING A BETTER DIFLUENT FLOW ALOFT. H85 TEMPS CONTINUE TO RUN 16C-18C ACROSS THE AREA...WHICH IS WARM BUT NOT TOO STRONG TO HINDER ANY DEVELOPMENT FROM BACKBUILDING INTO THE NORTHERN ZONES. WITH THE BETTER DYNAMICS LIFTING NORTH THROUGH THE DAY...ISOLATED CONVECTION REMAINS POSSIBLE INTO THE AFTERNOON ACROSS THE INLAND AND WESTERN AREAS WITH DAYTIME HEATING. FOCUS SHIFTS WEST THIS EVENING AS A MIDLEVEL SHORTWAVE HELPS INITIATE ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE SIERRA MADRE WHICH MAY NEAR THE WESTERN ZONES. TUESDAY SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY QUIETER WITH MORNING STREAMER SHOWERS TRANSITIONING TO ISOLATED INLAND DEVELOPMENT DUE TO DAYTIME HEATING.  
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE RIDGE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...KEEPING MOST OF THE AREA DRY. THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT CHANCE STORMS WILL AFFECT THE NORTHWESTERN BRUSH COUNTRY TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. 00Z ECMWF CONTINUES TO DEPICT A COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH NORTH TEXAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND STALLING OVER SOUTH-CENTRAL TEXAS THURSDAY EVENING. POTENTIAL FOR MCS TO FORM OVER THE BIG COUNTRY AND BACKBUILD TO SOUTHWEST INTO THE WESTERN HILL COUNTRY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS REGION OF LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE WITH THE FRONT IS IN PROXIMITY WITH DIFLUENT FLOW ALOFT DOWNSTREAM FROM THE NEXT UPPER LOW MOVING INTO CALIFORNIA. EXPECT A GOOD CHANCE THE MCS WILL MOVE TOWARD REGION ON THURSDAY AS THE FRONT STALLS NORTH OF THE AREA. WILL CONTINUE TO SHOW GOOD CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY. A STRONG SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE NORTHEAST FROM NORTHEAST MEXICO TO CENTRAL TEXAS THURSDAY NIGHT. WILL SHOW GOOD CHANCE POPS OVER THE BRUSH COUNTRY FOR THURSDAY NIGHT. THE FRONT WILL LIFT NORTH BY FRIDAY WITH A LITTLE LOWER CHANCE FOR RAIN FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. ACTIVE PATTERN OF STORM SYSTEMS MOVING OUT OF THE DESERT SOUTHWEST THROUGH THE ROCKIES REPEATS AGAIN LATE WEEK. THE NEXT UPPER LOW WILL BE OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FRIDAY MORNING AND MOVE ACROSS THE FOUR CORNERS REGION SATURDAY AND INTO THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS SUNDAY. ECMWF SHOWS THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS EXTENDING SOUTHWEST INTO NORTHWEST MEXICO FOR SATURDAY AND MOVING TOWARD SOUTH TEXAS ON SUNDAY. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES MAY BE UP AROUND 2 INCHES AGAIN BY THE WEEKEND LEADING TO ANOTHER POTENTIAL ROUND OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.  
THE VERY WET PATTERN WILL CONTINUE THIS WEEK BEFORE POSSIBLY SHOWING SOME SIGNS OF BREAKING DOWN NEXT WEEK. A SPLIT FLOW UPPER LEVEL PATTERN WILL PERSIST THIS WEEK WITH A STRONGER THAN NORMAL SRN STREAM FEATURING EMBEDDED SHORTWAVE TROFS OR CLOSED LOWS.  THE NEXT CLOSED LOW IN THE SEEMINGLY ENDLESS SERIES WAS SITUATED NEAR THE CNTRL CA COAST EARLY THIS MORNING. THIS STORM SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO ROTATE NEWD TOWARDS WY BY LATE TUESDAY AFTERNOON...THEN OVER THE NRN PLAINS BY WED MORNING AND WEAKEN FURTHER. A SFC COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE MOVG SLOWLY ACROSS THE TX AND OK PNHDLS TODAY AND SETTLE SOUTH OF THE FCST AREA. BEHIND THIS BOUNDARY...EAST TO SE LOW LEVEL MOIST UPSLOPE FLOW WILL COMMENCE TODAY ACROSS THE REGION. AS THE UPPER LEVEL STORM SYSTEM BEGINS MOVG ENE THROUGH TONIGHT AND TUE...THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL BECOME MORE DIFFLUENT ACROSS THE SRN HIGH PLAINS DURG THIS PERIOD. ALL THIS...COUPLED WITH INCREASING LIFT FROM THE UPPER LEVEL STORM SYSTEM AND DEEP MOISTURE SUGGESTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF WIDESRPEAD SHOWERS AND TSTMS TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY. HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE ACROSS THE FCST AREA TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. DECIDED TO MENTION THIS POTENTIAL IN THE WEATHER GRIDS AND PUBLIC PRODUCTS. CONTEMPLATED A FLOOD WATCH BUT WILL LET NEXT SHIFT EVALUATE FURTHER TODAY...AND ONE MAY BECOME NECESSARY FOR TONIGHT AND TUESDAY ACROSS PARTS IF NOT ALL THE FCST AREA. INCREASED POPS MORE TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...THEN TAPERED VALUES FROM WEST TO EAST TUE NIGHT AS THE STORM SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE NRN PLAINS AND WEAKENS. A REINFORCING SURGE OF COOLER AIR LOOKS PLAUSIBLE LATE TUE NIGHT AND WED. MODELS ARE DIVIDED ON HOW MUCH DRY AIR FILTERS IN FOR WED AND THURSDAY. HAVE COMPROMISED AND RESTRICTED POPS TO JUST SLGT CHC VALUES FOR PARTS OF THE AREA WED THRU THURSDAY.  FOR THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...THE NEXT CLOSED UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO DIG DOWN TO NEAR THE SRN CA COAST THURSDAY NIGHT...THEN HEAD TOWARDS THE FOUR CORNERS REGION BY SAT MORNING... AND FINALLY INTO THE CNTRL PLAINS BY SUNDAY MORNING. MOISTURE WILL RAPIDLY RETURN THURSDAY NIGHT FOR THIS STORM SYSTEM TO UTILIZE...AND HAVE RAISED POPS SOME FOR THU NIGHT THRU FRI NIGHT. AS THIS UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVES CLOSER SATURDAY...POPS WERE FASHIONED IN A GRADIENT WITH SLGT CHC VALUES WRN ZONES...INCREASING TO HIGH CHC ERN ZONES. POPS WERE THEN RESTRICTED TO JUST THE ERN ZONES SATURDAY NIGHT. DRY WEATHER THEN RETURNS FOR NEXT SUNDAY AND MONDAY AT THIS TIME.  ANDRADE

A PASSING UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE WILL BRING A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO AND WEST TEXAS THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT WITH MOST OF THE STORMS OCCURRING EAST OF THE RIO GRANDE. WESTERLY WINDS WILL RESULT SEASONABLY WARM DRY WEATHER TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY BEFORE ANOTHER TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE CAUSES A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EAST OF THE RIO GRANDE ON THURSDAY. WESTERLY WINDS WILL THEN BRING A RETURN OF WARM DRY WEATHER FRIDAY THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND.  
ACTIVE SOUTHERLY BRANCH OF SPLIT FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO STREAM ACROSS THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND. FOR TODAY THE NEXT IN AN ONGOING SERIES OF UPPER LOWS WILL BE MOVING ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BEFORE LIFTING TO THE NORTHEAST INTO THE GREAT BASIN TONIGHT. AN ASSOCIATED TRAILING TROUGH WILL CONCURRENTLY ROTATE AROUND ARIZONA TODAY BEFORE ENTERING NEW MEXICO LATER TONIGHT. BACKING FLOW AND FALLING PRESSURES IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE WILL INDUCE SURFACE SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS AS FAR WEST AS THE RIO GRANDE WITH DRY LINE ALSO PUSHING TO THE WEST. LATEST DATA INDICATE DEWPOINTS MAY INCREASE FROM THE LOWER 40S TO LOWER 50S FROM AN EL PASO TO ALAMOGORDO LINE EAST BY EARLY THIS EVENING WITH CORRESPONDING MUCAPES RANGING FROM AROUND 300 TO 700 J/KG INDICATING ONLY WEAK INSTABILITY. INCREASING DYNAMIC LIFT AHEAD OF UPPER SYSTEM SHOULD THEREFORE INITIATE A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MOSTLY THIS EVENING OVER MAINLY EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA. WIND SHEAR WILL BE SIGNIFICANT VIA 40 TO 50 KT FLOW AT 6 KM AGL BUT GIVEN THE LACK OF INSTABILITY SEVERE WEATHER THREAT MAY BE LIMITED TO EASTERN PORTIONS OF HUDSPETH AND OTERO COUNTIES.  FLOW ALOFT BECOMES MORE ZONAL ON TUESDAY WITH WEAK LEE TROUGH TO THE EAST. ASSOCIATED DEEP WEST TO SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL PRODUCE SEASONABLY WARM DRY WEATHER BOTH DAYS. YET ANOTHER DEEP UPPER TROUGH WILL BE SLOWLY ENTERING THE WEST COAST WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WITH CLOSED LOW MOVING INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FRIDAY. THIS PATTERN WILL CAUSE A BACKING MORE SOUTHERLY FLOW AT LOW LEVELS WITH MOISTURE ADVECTION INTO FAR EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA. WEAK UPPER WAVE EJECTING INTO THE REGION FROM THE SOUTHWEST SHOULD THEREFORE AGAIN GENERATE CONVECTION FAR EASTERN PORTIONS ON THURSDAY WITH WARM DRY WEATHER PERSISTING ELSEWHERE.  UPPER LOW WILL SUBSEQUENTLY ACCELERATE EASTWARD ACROSS THE GREAT BASING AND CENTRAL ROCKIES FRIDAY AND SATURDAY CAUSING LEE SURFACE TROUGHING TO DEEPEN TO THE EAST. INCREASING WEST TO SOUTHWEST LOW AND MID LEVEL WINDS WILL PUSH DRY LINE EAST AGAIN WITH SEASONABLY WARM DRY AND OCCASIONALLY BREEZY CONDITIONS OCCURRING ACROSS NEW MEXICO/WEST TEXAS FRIDAY THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND.  
A FEW AREAS OF MVFR CEILINGS AND VISIBILITIES IN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BETWEEN 21Z AND 08Z MAINLY FOR AREAS EAST OF THE RIO GRANDE. OTHERWISE VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED WITH AREAS OF CEILINGS ABOVE 10,000 FEET AGL. SURFACE WIND SPEEDS AROUND 15 TO 25 KT WITH GUSTS TO 40 KT POSSIBLE NEAR THUNDERSTORMS.  
A PASSING UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE WILL BRING A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO AND WEST TEXAS THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT WITH MOST OF THE STORMS OCCURRING EAST OF THE RIO GRANDE. WINDS SPEEDS WILL BE AROUND 15 TO 25 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 50 MPH NEAR THUNDERSTORMS. WESTERLY WINDS WILL RESULT SEASONABLY WARM DRY WEATHER TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY BEFORE ANOTHER TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE CAUSES A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EAST OF THE RIO GRANDE ON THURSDAY. LOWEST HUMIDITY WILL BE AROUND 5 TO 15 PERCENT LOWLANDS AND 20 TO 30 PERCENT MOUNTAINS TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY. WESTERLY WINDS WILL THEN BRING A RETURN OF WARM DRY WEATHER FRIDAY THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND WITH OCCASIONALLY BREEZY WINDS.  
Satellite and observations are showing low clouds and dewpoints in the upper 60s in the lower Trans Pecos beginning to surge northwestward into the Permian Basin this morning. This moisture will push up against the Guadalupe and Davis Mountains this afternoon where daytime heating and an appropriately timed weak upper trough will initiate convection. CAPE and shear will be more than enough to support severe convection and SPC has almost the entire area outlooked in a slight risk for severe thunderstorms with large hail the main threat...but strong winds, and even isolated tornadoes will also be possible.  Tuesday will see another round of convection with increasing southwesterly flow ahead of an upper low over the Four Corners developing a dryline over the western Permian Basin. Instability will not be as high as today but again it should be enough to support severe thunderstorms and once again the Permian Basin is outlooked by SPC with a slight risk.  Things change a bit Wednesday with the approach of a weak cold front. How far south the front pushes during the day on Wednesday will affect thunderstorm potential...an earlier arrival will bring cooler air in quicker and limit instability while a later arrival will allow for better daytime heating and more instability. The NAM is fastest with the timing of the front...and is normally preferred in these situations due to its higher low level resolution with the other models having a slower passage after sunset. Despite this will go with model consensus and not bring the front through Midland before peak heating at this time but will have it entering the northeastern Basin with a good temperature gradient from northeast to southwest. The front will definitely be through by Thursday and cloudy skies and overrunning precipitation will combine with the weak cold air advection to drop temperatures well below normal.  Friday skies begin to clear out and afternoon heating will again cause instability and keep thunderstorm chances in the forecast through the weekend.  Hennig  
NORTHERN CA WILL CONTINUE ITS TRACK EAST/NORTHEAST OVER THE GREAT BASIN MONDAY WHILE WEAK RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS. THIS WILL PROVIDE A MORE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT ACROSS SOUTH TX WHILE SOME PERTURBATIONS MOVE ACROSS THE MEAN FLOW. THE SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW IN THE LOWER LEVELS WILL BRING SLIGHT DRIER AIR INTO THE AREA WHILE THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAIN NEAR THE SIERRA MADRE WHERE THE CONVECTION WILL BE CONCENTRATED DURING THE DAY. THE ACTIVITY SHOULD REMAIN WEST OF THE CWA NOT IMPACTING THE WESTERN COUNTIES BY THE AFTERNOON HOURS. THERE WILL BE A MIX OF SUN AND CLOUDS AS THE DRY AIR MIXES NOT ALLOWING FOR MUCH CONVECTION OVER THE RGV. TEMPERATURES WILL RISE TO NEAR 90S ACROSS THE CWA AND MID 80S NEAR THE COASTAL AREAS.  TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...AS THE LOW PRESSURE MOVES NORTHEAST...A FRONT MOVES SOUTH OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. THE FRONT REMAINS NORTH OF THE AREA WHILE SE FLOW BRINGS DEEP MOISTURE AHEAD OF IT. CLOUD COVER WILL INCREASE TONIGHT WITH BKN TO OVERCAST CEILINGS WHILE WINDS DECOUPLED. LOW TEMPERATURES WILL RANGE BETWEEN THE MID TO UPPER 70S WITH HUMID CONDITIONS. INTO TUESDAY... GRADIENT WILL STRENGTHEN INCREASING SE WINDS TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING AS HIGH PRESSURE INTERACTS WITH LEE TROUGH ALONG THE SIERRA MADRE. CONVECTION WILL HAVE A SIMILAR TREND AS MONDAY WITH MOST OF THE ACTIVITY REMAINING TO THE WEST NEAR THE SIERRA MADRE WITH NO MUCH ACTIVITY EXPECTED OVER THE CWA.  
ACROSS THE GULF COAST WILL INCREASE SE WINDS THIS AFTERNOON BECOMING EASTERLY TONIGHT. SEAS WILL INCREASE CLOSE TO 6 FEET AND REMAIN BELOW SCEC LEVEL THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. DRY AIR IN THE AREA WILL LIMIT THE POTENTIAL FOR CONVECTION IN THE SHORT TERM.  TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...GENERALLY MODERATE WINDS AND SEAS...WITH POSSIBLE PERIODIC SMALL CRAFT EXERCISE CAUTION...ARE EXPECTED TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO INTERACTING WITH WEAK LOW PRESSURE INLAND. WINDS AND SEAS MAY APPROACH SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CRITERIA SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY AS THE HIGH/LOW PRESSURE INTERACTION INTENSIFIES. 
STRENGTHENING LOW LEVEL JET HAS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO SCATTERED SHOWER AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT EARLY THIS MORNING. COVERAGE SHOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE THROUGH THE EARLY TO MID MORNING HOURS...EVENTUALLY FOCUSING MORE TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST CWA...NORTHEAST OF A SAN MARCOS TO HALLETTSVILLE LINE...AS MID LEVEL FLOW VEERS MORE SOUTHWEST AND SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR WORKS INTO THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES.  CONVECTION SHOULD ALSO FIRE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF MEXICO AND ACROSS THE BIG BEND AND WEST TEXAS NEAR THE DRY LINE. A FEW OF THESE STORMS COULD REACH WESTERN AREAS OF THE EDWARDS PLATEAU AND RIO GRANDE PLAINS THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. A STRONGER STORM OR TWO WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THIS REGION.  TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT THE UPPER LEVEL LOW CURRENTLY OVER CALIFORNIA WILL SHEAR NORTHEAST THROUGH THE ROCKIES. A LEAD MID AND UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE WILL PASS THROUGH WEST TEXAS AND THE PANHANDLE...AND INTO NORTH TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA. THE MAIN FORCING WILL PASS PRIMARILY NORTH OF THE CWA...BUT CLOSE ENOUGH FOR SCATTERED POPS NORTH OF A DEL RIO TO AUSTIN LINE.  
LOW WILL DEVELOP OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. INITIALLY SHOULD SEE A REDUCTION IN POPS ON WEDNESDAY WITH SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR IN PLACE...STRENGTHENING CAP...AND LACK OF FORCING.  FORECAST CONFIDENCE DECREASES WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY... DEPENDENT ON SOUTHWARD PROGRESSION OF A COLD FRONT. BOTH THE NAM12 AND ECMWF ARE STRONGER AND FARTHER SOUTH THAN THE GFS WITH A COLD FRONT THAT DROPS SOUTH BEHIND THE AFOREMENTIONED DEPARTING SHORTWAVE THROUGH THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TUESDAY NIGHT. BOTH HAVE THE FRONT ENTERING THE HILL COUNTRY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND BISECTING THE CWA BY 12Z THURSDAY. ORGANIZED CONVECTION AND ASSOCIATED OUTLFOW TO THE NORTH ON WEDNESDAY WILL LIKELY PLAY A ROLE ON HOW FAR SOUTH FRONT MAKES IT WEDNESDAY NIGHT. FOR NOW HAVE FOLLOWED SLIGHTLY CLOSER TO THE NAM12/ECMWF SOLUTIONS OVER THE GFS...SHOWING THE FRONT WILL BE CLOSE OR INTO THE CWA WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. BACKED FLOW...MOISTURE POOLING...WEAKENING CAP AND THE FRONT SHOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN POPS...ESPECIALLY NORTHERN AND WESTERN AREAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND SOUTHERN AND WESTERN AREAS THURSDAY.  CONFIDENCE IS EVEN LOWER THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY ON WHERE FRONT STALLS AND WHEN IT EVENTUALLY LIFTS BACK NORTH. AGAIN...CONVECTIVE OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WILL LIKELY PLAY A ROLE IN THIS. TIMING OF ANY DISTURBANCES ALSO IN THE APPROACHING ACTIVE SUB-TROPICAL BRANCH OF THE JET STREAM ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PINPOINT THIS FAR OUT. BUT GENERALLY CONTINUED SCATTERED POPS IN THE FORECAST THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. TEMPERATURES ALSO TRICKY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY... AND MAY HAVE TO BE LOWERED IN FUTURE PACKAGES ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS FOR THURSDAY IF FRONT IS FARTHER SOUTH.  EVENTUALLY THE SECOND UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER CALIFORNIA OPENS AND MOVES EAST FRIDAY AND INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND TEXAS OVER THE WEEKEND. BOTH THE ECMWF AND GFS ARE INDICATE ANOTHER GOOD SHOT OF PRECIP SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.  
STRENGTHENING LOW LEVEL JET ARE CONTRIBUTING TO SCATTERED SHOWER AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT EARLY THIS MORNING. COVERAGE SHOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE THROUGH THE EARLY TO MID MORNING HOURS...EVENTUALLY FOCUSING MORE TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST CWA...NORTHEAST OF A SAN MARCOS TO HALLETTSVILLE LINE...AS MID LEVEL FLOW VEERS MORE SOUTHWEST AND SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR WORKS INTO THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES.  CONVECTION SHOULD ALSO FIRE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF MEXICO AND ACROSS THE BIG BEND AND WEST TEXAS NEAR THE DRY LINE. A FEW OF THESE STORMS COULD REACH WESTERN AREAS OF THE EDWARDS PLATEAU AND RIO GRANDE PLAINS THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. A STRONGER STORM OR TWO WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THIS REGION.  TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT THE UPPER LEVEL LOW CURRENTLY OVER CALIFORNIA WILL SHEAR NORTHEAST THROUGH THE ROCKIES. A LEAD MID AND UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE WILL PASS THROUGH WEST TEXAS AND THE PANHANDLE...AND INTO NORTH TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA. THE MAIN FORCING WILL PASS PRIMARILY NORTH OF THE CWA...BUT CLOSE ENOUGH FOR SCATTERED POPS NORTH OF A DEL RIO TO AUSTIN LINE ON TUESDAY.  
THE SHORT TERM PERIOD WILL FOCUS ON THE RETURN OF SCATTERED TO WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...THAT COULD COMMENCE AS EARLY AS LATE THIS AFTN.  THE PACIFIC FRONT/DRYLINE THAT AFFECTED THE SOUTHERN PLAINS YESTERDAY WAS WELL SOUTH AND EAST OF THE CWA EARLY THIS MORNING...AS HINTED AT BY DEWPOINTS IN THE 60S AND 70S ACROSS THE CONCHO VALLEY...BIG COUNTRY AND EDWARDS PLATEAU AREAS. AS SUCH...SOME FOG AND/OR LOW CLOUDS HAVE DEVELOPED ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE SAID AREAS. COMPUTER MODELS HINT AT THE BOUNDARY RETREATING TO NEAR THE FAR SRN SOUTH PLAINS AND LOW ROLLING PLAINS BY AOA DAYBREAK...BRINGING WITH IT RICH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND A CHANCE FOR THE FOG AND/OR STRATUS DECK TO MAKE HEADWAY TOWARDS THE FA. HOWEVER...MODEL SOLUTIONS SUCH AS THE HRRR AND THE NAM EXHIBIT THE FOG AND LOW CLOUDS TO STOP JUST SHORT OF THE FA AND DISSIPATE...GIVEN SFC WINDS VEERING TO THE W-SW THROUGHOUT DAYBREAK AND THUS MITIGATING THE TRANSPORT OF THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND SEE IF THIS DOES INDEED OCCUR.  ATTENTION WILL TURN TO AN UA LOW THAT WAS IMPINGING ON CNTRL/SRN CALI PER 07Z SATELLITE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY...AND IS PROGGED TO TRANSLATE ENE TO NEAR THE FOUR-CORNERS REGION BY TONIGHT. AS SUCH...SW FLOW ALOFT WILL SHARPEN. EMBEDDED WITHIN THIS SW FLOW IS AN IMPULSE THAT MODEL SOLUTIONS SHOW EJECTING OUT AHEAD OF THE PARENT UA LOW...AND NEAR THE SWRN ZONES LATE THIS AFTN/EARLY EVENING AND PROGRESS TO THE NE TO ACROSS THE NERN ZONES BY TONIGHT. WITH SFC LEE TROUGHING DEEPENING DUE TO THE APPROACHING UA LOW...THIS WILL AID TO BACK SFC WINDS TO THE S-SE AND PWATS WILL SOAR INTO THE 1.00- 1.50 INCH RANGE BY TONIGHT...WHILST THE LLJ CRANKS UP TO 20-40 KTS. WITH ALL THAT SAID...CONVECTION IS STILL EXPECTED TO INITIATE ACROSS THE FAR SW SOUTH PLAINS AS EARLY AS LATE THIS AFTN/EARLY THIS EVENING...ESPECIALLY IF THE TIMING OF THE ANTICIPATED EMBEDDED IMPULSE STAYS TRUE. PRECIP WILL BECOME SCATTERED TO PERHAPS WIDESPREAD AS IT PROGRESSES NE TO ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF THE CWA THROUGH THE NIGHT. TO ADD FUEL TO THE PROVERBIAL FIRE...A COLD FRONT WILL BACKDOOR INTO THE REGION THIS EVENING/TONIGHT...WHICH COULD SERVE AS ANOTHER FOCUS FOR STORM DEVELOPMENT. WITH SUCH HIGH PWATS...MODERATE-HEAVY RAINFALL CAN NOT BE RULED OUT WHICH RAISES CONCERNS FOR LOCALIZED FLOODED. WE ALSO NEED TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR SOME STORMS BECOMING STRONG TO SEVERE...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SWRN ZONES LATE THIS AFTN AS PROGGED MUCAPE VALUES OF 2-3 KJ/KG...30-40 KTS OF 0-6 KM BULK SHEAR...STEEPENED LAPSE RATES AND VEERING WIND PROFILES SAYS AS MUCH /HAIL AND GUSTY WINDS WILL BE THE PRIMARY THREATS/.  A SEASONABLY WARM DAY WILL PREVAIL WITH HIGHS IN THE 70S AND 80S...FOLLOWED BY OVERNIGHT LOWS IN THE 50S AND 60S.  
(Today and Tonight)  Near normal temperatures can be expected this afternoon with highs mainly in the upper 80s. Abundant low level moisture will be present today, with dewpoint temperatures in the mid to upper 60s. As we heat up this afternoon, high resolution models are hinting that we should break the cap to allow for at least isolated to scattered showers and thunderstorms this afternoon, mainly across the southern two thirds of the region. At the same time, an upper level disturbance will approach from northern Mexico, resulting in showers and thunderstorms over West Texas/Big Bend Region. Some of this activity may move into at least the western counties of West Central Texas tonight, and this is where the highest PoPs were placed. Some of these storms may be strong to severe, although the severe threat will wane as we head into the late evening/early morning hours. Overnight lows will generally be in the mid 60s to near 70.  
/ISSUED 1145 PM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015/ VFR CONDITIONS PREVAIL NOW...BUT AS MOISTURE MOVES BACK TO THE NORTH...MVFR CIGS WILL DEVELOP OVER THE METROPLEX BY 9-10Z. ENOUGH LOW LEVEL COOLING HAS OCCURRED THIS EVENING WITH THE LIGHT WINDS AND CLEAR SKIES THAT IT RAISES THE POTENTIAL FOR IFR CIGS AROUND SUNRISE...BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW SO WILL SHOW THIS IN A TEMPO FROM 11-14Z. CIGS WILL LIFT TO VFR AROUND MIDDAY WITH GENERALLY VFR EXPECTED THEREAFTER. SOUTH WINDS WILL CONTINUE AT 5-10KT THROUGH MORNING...BUT THEY BECOME MORE EASTERLY MONDAY AFTERNOON.  WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH FOR CONVECTION THAT MAY DEVELOP EAST AND SOUTHEAST OF THE TAF SITES LATE TONIGHT OR EARLY MONDAY MORNING...BUT THIS ACTIVITY WOULD PROBABLY BE TOO FAR EAST TO AFFECT TERMINALS. THE AIRMASS WILL ALSO BE UNCAPPED AND UNSTABLE MONDAY AFTERNOON FOR SOME CONVECTION TO DEVELOP BUT ORGANIZED FORCING LOOKS LIMITED AND THEREFORE THE PROBABILITY OF CONVECTION IMPACTING AIRPORTS LOOKS TOO LOW TO MENTION.    TR.92  
SENT QUICK UPDATE TO GRIDS. LLJ FEEDING INTO REMNANT BOUNDARY PARKED BETWEEN CNTL POLK COUNTY INTO NRN COLORADO COUNTY. PRONOUNCED DIFFLUENCE ALOFT SHOULD SUPPORT REDEVELOPMENT/TRAINING CELLS. ADDED MENTION OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN AND WILL NEED TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON NE ZONES IN SHORT TERM. MORE LATER... 47  
TX...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK UNTIL 7 AM CDT THIS MORNING FOR THE      FOLLOWING ZONES: BRAZORIA...CHAMBERS...GALVESTON...      MATAGORDA.  GM...SMALL CRAFT SHOULD EXERCISE CAUTION UNTIL 7 AM CDT THIS MORNING      FOR THE FOLLOWING ZONES: GALVESTON BAY...MATAGORDA BAY...

MVFR/IFR...WITH LIGHT FOG. LIGHT RAIN/SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE BUT SHOULD REMAIN ISOLATED ENOUGH TO LEAVE OUT OF THE TAFS THROUGH THE PERIOD...WITH THE EXCEPTION AT VCT WHERE SLIGHTLY BETTER CONVERGENCE SHOULD RESIDE LEADING TO VCSH. CIGS ARE EXPECTED TO LIFT THROUGH THE MID MORNING...WITH WINDS BECOMING BREEZY. INCREASED GUSTS TO 20-25 KTS FOR AT LEAST ACROSS THE COASTAL PLAINS FOR CRP AND ALI. A RETURN OF MVFR CIGS IS EXPECTED LATE IN THE CURRENT TAF PERIOD.  
ISOLD SHRA/TSRA ARE POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT. ALTHOUGH...MORE LIKELY TO BE PATCHY -RA. SHRA/TSRA WILL BECOME SCT ON MONDAY. FOR NOW...HAVE LEFT MENTION OUT OF TAFS AS PROBS ARE TOO LOW TO MENTION. AREAS OF MVFR CIGS LOWER TO IFR AND POSSIBLY LIFR OVERNIGHT INTO MORNING. CIGS LIFT TO VFR MIDDAY INTO AFTERNOON. MVFR CIGS RETURN MONDAY EVENING...THEN IFR MONDAY NIGHT. S TO SE WINDS 5 TO 15 KTS PREVAIL WITH GUSTS TO 25 KTS POSSIBLE.  
UPDATE...RECONFIGURED RAIN CHANCES OVERNIGHT FOR BEST AREAS IN THE RIO GRANDE PLAINS MAINLY NEAR THE US 83 CORRIDOR. STILL...FEEL RAIN AND THUNDERSTORM CHANCES ARE LOW WITH SOME CAVEATS. UPDATES ARE OUT AND FURTHER DETAILS CAN BE FOUND BELOW IN AN UPDATED DISCUSSION.  DISCUSSION...EXTRA CLOUDS THIS AFTERNOON AIDED IN KEEPING INSTABILITY DOWN AND THUS OVERALL RENEWED TSTORM ACTIVITY AT BAY. FOR TONIGHT...DEEP SOUTHERLY FLOW CONTINUES ACROSS THE REGION WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW 70S AS THE DRY LINE RETREATS WESTWARD. LOW CLOUDS ARE ONGOING AND WILL LOWER THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT AND MORNING...ALLOWING FOR DRIZZLE/MIST ACROSS GOOD PORTION OF THE AREA. FEEL THIS IS THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO OUTSIDE OF WHAT HI- RES MODELS HAVE BEEN INDICATING. HRRR/NAM AND OTHER HI-RES GUIDANCE SUGGEST ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT OVERNIGHT IN THIS WARM AIR ADVECTION REGIME. TWO ISSUES AT HAND APPEAR TO BE LACK OF ANY LOW-LVL TRIGGER OR BOUNDARY AND HOW A PARCEL WILL RISE OVER THE CAP. SOME MODELS LEAN TOWARDS THE CAP ERODING BUT NOT SURE SURFACE PARCELS WOULD READILY LIFT DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS WITH NO FOCUS AND WEAK ISENTROPIC ASCENT. NAM/GFS DO HINT AT A WEAK H7 S/WV MOVING OVER THE REGION MIDNIGHT TO 7AM THIS COULD BE ENOUGH TO HELP LIFT PARCELS. AS SUCH...DO NOT HAVE MUCH CONFIDENCE IN WIDER COVERAGE OF TSTORMS DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT BUT HAVE PLACED BEST CHANCES ALONG US 83 CORRIDOR WHERE THE WAVE WOULD BEST COINCIDE WITH UPSLOPE FLOW AROUND A WEAK SFC-H850 LOW ALONG THE RIO GRANDE RIVER. MONDAY WILL BE A TRICKY DAY AS WELL GIVEN SUBTLE WAVES MOVING OVER THE REGION BUT SOME NEGATIVE THETAE ADVECTION LOOKS TO INFILTRATE NORTH ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST PORTION OF THE REGION THAT SHOULD KEEP COVERAGE OF TSTORMS LOWER THERE. THERE IS SOME HINT IN THE EC THAT A POTENTIAL COMPLEX COULD CROSS THE RIO GRANDE LATE TOMORROW AND THAT WILL NEED TO BE MONITORED FOR ADDITIONAL FLASH FLOODING CONCERNS.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 715 PM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015/  AVIATION.../00Z TAFS/ SOUTHEAST FLOW AND WEAK ASCENT WILL CAUSE MVFR-VFR CIGS TO LOWER TO IFR BY 05Z AT SAT/SSF AND 09Z AT DRT...WHILE AUS FURTHER NORTH OF THE MAIN ASCENT WILL BE BORDERLINE IFR-MVFR. MODELS SUGGEST ISOLATED SHRA AND TSRA ARE POSSIBLE TONIGHT AT ALL SITES...BUT A WEAK DISTURBANCE MOVING THROUGH HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO OVERCOME AN ATMOSPHERE THAT IS WORKED OVER FROM THIS MORNINGS STORMS THUS FAR. LIFR CIGS MAY ALSO BRIEFLY OCCUR BETWEEN 10-14Z AT SAT/SSF AND DRT...BUT CONFIDENCE WAS TOO LOW TO INCLUDE AT THIS TIME. SEVERAL MODELS SUGGEST THAT ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHRA AND TSRA WILL DEVELOP OFF THE MEXICAN MOUNTAINS FOR DRT AND ALONG AN EAST-WEST ORIENTED REGION OF ASCENT FOR SAT/SSF/AUS TOMORROW...BUT WILL WAIT TO SEE IF THE UPCOMING MODEL CYCLE TRENDS WETTER OR DRIER.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 316 PM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015/  SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)... A MCS MODIFIED AIR MASS WILL LIMIT MUCH OF THE CONVECTION FOR TONIGHT...ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE MODEL DATA CONTINUES TO SUPPORT SCATTERED CONVECTION AND SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL AMOUNTS. WILL UNDERCUT POPS TO MAINLY SLIGHT CHANCES...WITH ONLY A SMALL REGION OF SLIGHTLY ENHANCED POPS OVER THE RIO GRANDE PLAINS. A SMALL OUTFLOW BOUNDARY LOCATED IN THIS AREA COULD TAP INTO DAYTIME HEATING THIS EVENING...WITH INCREASING STABILITY EXPECTED TONIGHT. IF A STRONG CELL DOES DEVELOP THIS EVENING...LIGHT WESTERLY STEERING FLOW SHOULD LEAD TO SHORT-LIVED CONVECTION. THE HRRR GENERATES OVERNIGHT CONVECTION OVER CENTRAL COUNTIES FROM THE LLJ ENHANCED RETURN FLOW OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...BUT EXPECT MORE IN THE LINE OF SPRINKLES OR DRIZZLE AFTER MIDNIGHT. RAIN CHANCES SHOULD PICK UP AGAIN MONDAY...BUT BOUNDARY INTERACTIONS SHOULD BE MORE FAVORABLE WELL TO THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST. THUS WILL KEEP LOW END CHANCE POPS WHICH IS STILL DOWN FROM THE SYNOPTIC MODELS THAT ARE ROUGHLY 20 PERCENT HIGHER ON POPS. BY MONDAY NIGHT...CONVERGENCE TO MODEL CONSENSUS IS REASONABLE WITH POPS STILL FAVORED TO THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST BASED ON CONVECTIVE INITIATION MOSTLY FAVORED TO THE NW.  LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)... TUESDAY INTO THURSDAY REMAINS AN INTERESTING PERIOD WITH MOST OF THE SYNOPTIC MODELS SHIFTING IN FAVOR OF A FRONTAL ZONE REACHING CENTRAL TX. WITH THE NEXT MID TO UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH EJECTION...EXPECTED TO MOVE FROM NRN MEXICO INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS...SHOWN TO BE MORE SHALLOW AND FARTHER NW THAN THE PREVIOUS COUPLE OF DISTURBANCES...AM STILL IN FAVOR OF CONSERVATIVE POPS WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS TO THE NORTH. BY THURSDAY...REPEATED ROUNDS OF THUNDERSTORMS OVER NORTH TEXAS SHOULD ENABLE ENOUGH BOUNDARY POOLING TO ENHANCE RAIN CHANCES INTO THE WEEKEND...THOUGH THE BLEND OF MODEL DATA ONLY SHOWS A SUBTLE EASTERLY SHIFT IN WINDS. LATER RUNS SHOULD BE ABLE TO FURTHER CLARIFY WHETHER A FRONT MAKES INTO THE AREA...AND WITH THAT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING IF NEW FLASH FLOOD OR POSSIBLE SEVERE THREATS WERE TO COME ABOUT. TEMPERATURES ARE ALSO AT THE MERCY OF THESE EVER CHANGING BOUNDARY AND THUNDERSTORM INDUCED CLOUD AREAS...SO A BLENDED GUIDANCE APPROACH TO THE FORECAST CONTINUES WITH CONTINUED HUMID AND MILD CONDITIONS.  
SHOWS SE WINDS FROM 10 TO 15 KNOTS ACROSS THE AREA WITH BKN TO OVC AROUND 1500 TO 1800 FT. WINDS WILL REMAIN AROUND 12 KNOTS THROUGH THE NIGHT KEEPING MIXING TO THE BASE OF THE INVERSION WITH CEILINGS REMAINING AROUND 1200 TO 1500 FEET AT ALL TERMINALS. DEBRI HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS FROM EARLIER CONVECTION WILL STREAM EASTWARD. IN THE AFTERNOON...EXPECT A BREAK IN CLOUD COVER WITH VFR CONDITIONS. MORE SUNSHINE WILL ALLOW DAY TIME HEATING AND MORE MIXING FOR WINDS TO PICKUP WITH A GUSTS NEAR 25 KNOTS. WINDS DIMINISH BY EVENING HOURS WITH CEILINGS RETURNING BKN TO OVC 2000 FEET THROUGH MIDNIGHT.  
DISCUSSION...AFTER A BRIEF `SCARE` WITH PRETTY HEALTHY CONVECTION ALONG A LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE ZONE FROM EASTERN NUEVO LEON SOUTH THROUGH WESTERN TAMAULIPAS...THINGS HAVE QUICKLY QUIETED DOWN THIS EVENING AND NO ADDITIONAL ACTION IS EXPECTED NEAR THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY NORTHERN RANCHLANDS OVERNIGHT. WILL REMOVE MENTIONABLE PRECIPITATION OVERNIGHT FOR ALL AREAS AND TOUCH UP CLOUD COVER A BIT...OTHERWISE FORECAST IS ON TRACK.  AVIATION UPDATE...ONLY COSMETIC CHANGES WERE MADE FOR THE 00Z PACKAGE FROM THE 18Z PACKAGE. SHOULD BE JUST ENOUGH WIND TO KEEP THINGS MIXED TO THE BASE OF THE INVERSION...WHICH SETTLES IN JUST ABOVE IFR AROUND 1200 FEET BY 06Z AND CONTINUES THROUGH 14/15Z AT ALL TERMINALS. ALL MODELS SHOW SUFFICIENT DRYING AND SEPARATION AT THE CLOUD BASE BY AFTERNOON MONDAY...UNLIKE TODAY...WHICH WILL BRING SCATTERED 3500-4500 FOOT CLOUDS BY NOON OR SO IN ALL AREAS. THE ADDITIONAL SUNSHINE SHOULD ALLOW SOME GUSTINESS...BUT NOTHING TOO CRAZY WITH GRADIENT HAVING SLACKENED AS TEXAS IS BETWEEN SYSTEMS.  MARINE UPDATE...WITH PRESSURE GRADIENT ON THE WANE EXPECT A LESSER UPTICK IN OVERNIGHT GULF WINDS THAN IN RECENT DAYS. BUOY 20 STILL SUSTAINED BELOW 10 KNOTS AT 10 PM AND RESEARCH BUOY 40 NM EAST OF SOUTH PADRE SIMILAR A FEW HOURS EARLIER. WE MAY REACH A FEW HOURS OF CAUTION BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND 4 AM...BUT FOR NOW WILL HOLD FORECAST JUST SHY ON THE AVERAGE AND KEEP SEAS UNDER 6 FEET ON THE AVERAGE AS WELL. LAGUNA MADRE WINDS SHOULD REMAIN FRESH BUT GENERALLY BELOW 15 KNOTS EXCEPT FOR GUSTS OVERNIGHT. 52/BSG  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 242 PM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015/  SHORT TERM /NOW THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT/...A CONVECTIVE LINE OVER EAST CENTRAL TEXAS SHOULD CONTINUE MOVING TOWARD THE EAST...BUT INFLOW OVER THE CWA HAS DEVELOPED INTO WEAK SHOWER ACTIVITY OVER KENEDY COUNTY AND NOW THE MID VALLEY. SLIGHTLY DEEPER CONVECTION...WITH A FEW TSTMS IN THE MIX...WILL BE POSSIBLE THROUGH EARLY EVENING WITH SURFACE DEW POINTS IN THE MID 70S...THOUGH A WEAK CAP AND DRIER AIR ALOFT MAY PUT THE KIBOSH ON ANY MORE SIGNIFICANT WEATHER. MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES WILL PREVAIL TONIGHT...WITH LOW TEMPS REMAINING ABOVE NORMAL IN THE MID 70S.  THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STORM SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE NORTHEAST AND H5 RIDGING WILL BUILD OVER THE HIGH PLAINS IN THE SHORT TERM. HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE SOUTH OUT OF THE CANADIAN PLAINS AND INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ON MONDAY. THE TRAJECTORY WILL TAKE THE AIR MASS SLASH FRONT EAST WHERE THE BOUNDARY WILL MOVE TOWARD THE NORTH GULF COAST...BUT MAY NEVER OR WILL JUST BARELY GET THERE. MONDAY HIGH TEMPS WILL CONTINUE TO TREND ABOVE NORMAL...IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S...WITH ABOVE NORMAL MID 70S FOR LOW TEMPERATURES MONDAY NIGHT. LIGHT TO MODERATE SOUTHEAST WINDS WILL PREVAIL WITH A MIX OF CLOUDS AND SUN.  LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...LONG TERM PERIOD IS DOMINATED BY RIDGING BUILDING IN FROM THE EAST AS THE NEXT H5 TROUGH MOVES MORE NORTHWARD INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS. MODELS INDICATE THE MOISTURE WILL BE MORE LIMITED...WITH PW VALUES REMAINING BELOW 1.5 INCHES THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON. THESE FACTORS WILL LEAD TO A DRY AND WARMER FORECAST FOR TUESDAY TO THURSDAY...WITH HIGHS IN THE LOWER 90S. SHORTWAVES ROTATING AROUND THE NEXT H5 TROUGH ACROSS THE DESERT SOUTHWEST WILL START TO TAP SLOWLY INCREASING MOISTURE TO TRY TO SPARK SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LATE IN THE WEEK. THERE IS AN OUTSIDE CHANCE THAT SHOWERS COULD START OUT WEST THURSDAY AFTERNOON...BUT MORE LIKELIHOOD DURING THE DAY FRIDAY AND INTO NEXT WEEKEND.  MARINE... NOW THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL INTERACT WITH PERSISTENT LOWER PRESSURE INLAND TO PRODUCE MODERATE TO STRONG SOUTHEAST WINDS AND HIGHER SEAS ALONG THE LOWER TEXAS COAST THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. EXERCISE CAUTION CONDITIONS ON THE GULF MAY BECOME LOW END SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS BY LATE THIS EVE...PERSISTING UNTIL SOMETIME MONDAY MORNING. DUE TO THE BORDER LINE FCST...OPTED TO LET THE NEXT SHIFT TAKE A SECOND LOOK BEFORE MAKING A FINAL DECISION ON ISSUING A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY.  TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...WINDS WILL BEGIN THE PERIOD IN THE 15 TO 20 KNOT RANGE DUE TO GRADIENT BETWEEN EXPANSIVE HIGH ACROSS THE EASTERN US AND LOW PRESSURE ACROSS THE ROCKIES. THIS WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH SEAS ABOVE 5 FEET THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON. STARTING WEDNESDAY THE LOW PRESSURE STARTS TO WEAKEN...WITH SFC RIDGE BECOMING MORE DOMINANT ACROSS THE WESTERN GULF. THIS WILL PULL WINDS DOWN TO 10 TO 15 KNOTS...WITH SEAS LOWERING TO AROUND 3 FEET.  
Gulf moisture will continue to increase overnight on light southeast winds. Expecting Gulf stratus with IFR ceilings at KMAF at around 10z and continue through 17z. At KINK, expecting MVFR ceilings by 15z through 19z. Confidence was not high enough at this time to include restricted flight conditions elsewhere but this will need to be monitored with the latest guidance and trends. An upper level disturbance will bring a chance of thunderstorms to a majority of the terminals Monday afternoon and evening and have included a PROB30 group for that possibility. Southeast winds are expected to increase to 15 to 25 mph and gusty by Monday afternoon.  12  
DISCUSSION...  See 00Z Aviation Discussion below.  AVIATION...  Latest models back winds slightly after sunset, increasing PBL moisture on return flow. 18Z NAM buffer soundings still developing a few hours of LIFR cigs at KMAF, and MVFR at KFST. Otherwise, forecast soundings reach widespread convective temps 16-19Z, w/bases 4-9 kft agl. Best chances for convection look to be Texas terminals late in the forecast period.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 204 PM CDT Sun May 17 2015/  DISCUSSION... Convective potential will remain limited today/tonight, however by Mon AM low level moisture return will be ongoing in earnest, per a low level jet with deepening sely flow thru the day Monday. Meanwhile a plume of much steeper mid level LRs will overspread much of CWFA. This along with strong SB heating will result in large CAPE and the risk of severe storms, especially large hail, a brief tornado can`t be ruled out either. Looking closely at surface temps/dwpnts their respective maxima will be nearly co-located INVOF Pecos River Valley. It does make some sense that storms will initiate near/just ne of the Davis Mtns and then strengthen as they move newd into said warm/moist low level airmass. NAM12 is quite aggressive with instability, possibly around/over 3000 J/KG within the TX portion of Pecos River Valley. This with deep layer shear of 40-45kts will make for a most favorable environment for severe storms across the wrn PB by late afternoon and Lea/ern Eddy Co NM/nw PB by early evening. We will ramp up severe wording in our products for Monday. More of the same Tue, but the dryline will be better developed with rich dwpnt air still along and e of dryline, dwpnts low to mid 60s with evidence of a weak boundary in MSLP data. There is some concern that convection in the morning across the nrn PB could limit afternoon convection Tue? By Wed severe wx concerns will still exist with NAM12 indicating that a frontal boundary may be draped nw-se across the S Plains/nrn PB. A theta-e ridge at surface will be INVOF highway 349 and ewd. Attm it is difficult to confidently say where/if tstms will develop as previous days/nights precip will modulate features and timing. For what its worth, Thur frontal boundary would likely be farther s, even near I-10, and with sw flow aloft and with mstr still in place behind front more rain would be possible, including Fri. Indications are that the mid level trof will finally move enough ewd to restrict rain potential to the far e CWFA Sat/Sun. Temperatures stay more or less normal to below normal thru the forecast with some of the days modulated by precip and of course the front mid week.  
MAINLY MVFR CEILINGS EXPECTED AT SE TX TAF SITES TONIGHT. CANNOT RULE OUT LOCALIZED IFR CEILINGS AND VISIBILITIES (CXO OVC008 AT 18/04Z). CONCERNED THAT SHRA/TSRA DEVELOPMENT EXPECTED TO INITIATE OFF TO OUR NORTHEAST DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS COULD BACK BUILD INTO OUR AREA AND POSSIBLY REACH SOME OF OUR TAF SITES BEFORE SUNRISE. FOR THE 18/06Z TAFS...WENT AHEAD AND BROUGHT VCSH BACK INTO THE UTS AND CXO TAFS BEFORE SUNRISE...THEN INCLUDED VCTS FOR MOST OF THE AREA AFTER 18Z AS DAYTIME HEATING COMBINES WITH ANY BOUNDARIES CREATED DURING THE MORNING ACTIVITY. WITH RECENT MODEL PERFORMANCES...NOT VERY CONFIDENT IN THIS TAF PACKAGE. 42 
DISCUSSION... THE ISOLATED SHOWERS WHICH HAD DEVELOPED AFTER SUNSET TOWARD THE COAST HAVE DIMINISHED. THE 00Z NAM HAS AN UPPER DIFFLUENT ZONE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET OVER THE MS VALLEY INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS... AND A DEPARTING 500 MB VORTICITY AREA MOVING OUT OF THE STATE. THE HI RESOLUTION MODELS ARE HINTING AT REDEVELOPMENT OVERNIGHT TONIGHT AND INTO MONDAY MORNING OVER THE WESTERN COUNTIES. THE NAMBUFR SOUNDING FORECASTS ARE SHOWING A BIT OF A CAP FORMING IN THE WAKE OF THE STORMS FROM EARLIER TODAY...SO THINK THAT IF SHOWERS DO DEVELOP THAT THE COVERAGE WILL BE ISOLATED AT BEST FOR MOST LOCATIONS. TWEAKED THE EVENING COVERAGE. GIVEN THE LATEST MODEL OUTPUT...FELT THAT THE CHANCE POPS IN THE NORTH ARE GOOD FOR AT LEAST LATE IN THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD.  40  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 412 PM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015/  DISCUSSION... BUSY WEATHER AFTERNOON FOR SOUTHEAST TEXAS AS A LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUES TO PUSH ACROSS THE REGION. AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ACTIVITY STRETCHED FROM BRAZORIA COUNTY ALONG THE UPPER TEXAS COAST AND INTO LIBERTY COUNTY AS OF 3 PM CDT... AND GUSTY WINDS /AS WELL AS SOME BRIEF LOW LEVEL STORM ROTATION/ WAS NOTED AS THE REMAINDER OF THE LINE CONTINUED TO PUSH EASTWARD. EXPECT THE LINE TO CONTINUE TO PUSH EAST WITH THE BEST INSTABILITY LOCATED AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM /LAPS SHOWING 2000-3000 J/KG/ OVER CENTRAL LOUISIANA AND EXTRAPOLATION PLACES THIS LINE CLEAR OF THE FORECAST AREA BETWEEN 5 AND 7 PM CDT... ALTHOUGH A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS WILL CERTAINLY BE POSSIBLE. FOR THE REMAINDER OF TONIGHT... A MORE STABILIZED AIRMASS IN THE WAKE OF THIS SYSTEM WILL HELP LOWER RAIN CHANCES ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION /GENERALLY 10-20 POPS/ WITH THE PRESENCE OF A 20 TO 25 KNOT LOW LEVEL JET POSSIBLY BEING ENOUGH TO GENERATE A FEW STREAMER SHOWERS. AN INCREASE IN RAIN CHANCES OVER THE NORTHERN ZONES OCCURS TOWARDS SUNRISE MONDAY AS AN UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE APPROACHES THE REGION FROM THE WEST. OTHERWISE... EXPECT PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES OVERNIGHT WITH LOWS IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S.  AS STORMS APPROACH THE REGION ON MONDAY... NORTHERN ZONES WILL CONTINUE TO NEED TO BE MONITORED FOR POTENTIAL FLOODING CONCERNS WITH FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOWING PWATS REMAINING NEAR 1.6 TO 1.8 INCHES. WITH THE ADDITIONAL FAVORED AREAS FOR CONVECTION ON MONDAY WILL CENTER AROUND RESIDUAL BOUNDARIES FROM TODAY/S ACTIVITY... AIDED BY DAYTIME HEATING AND LIFT FROM THE PASSING SHORTWAVE. A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPROACHES THE REGION LATE MONDAY INTO EARLY TUESDAY AND THIS WILL SERVE AS ANOTHER FOCUSING MECHANISM FOR ADDITIONAL SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT... ALTHOUGH THE DETAILS ARE STILL A LITTLE FUZZY ON HOW FAR SOUTH THIS FEATURE WILL ACTUALLY MAKE IT /WITH CLIMATOLOGY NOT FAVORING THE FRONT TO REACH THE AREA/. BROAD TROUGHING WILL REMAIN OVER THE WESTERN CONUS THROUGH THE WEEK... BUT A BUILDING 500 MB RIDGE WILL ALLOW THE REGION TO FALL UNDER A MORE QUASI-ZONAL FLOW ALOFT /EFFECTIVELY SHIFTING THE TRAJECTORY OF PASSING DISTURBANCES FARTHER NORTH AND HELPING REDUCE RAIN CHANCES MID- WEEK/. ANOTHER LOW APPROACHES THE REGION BY NEXT WEEKEND... WITH RAIN CHANCES INCREASING CORRESPONDINGLY.  HUFFMAN  MARINE...  SOUTHERLY WINDS HAVE DECREASED DUE TO CONVECTION INLAND THAT HAS WEAKENED THE PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS THE AREA. THERE MAY BE SOME OUTFLOW WINDS ON GALVESTON BAY AND JUST OFF THE COAST BUT OVERALL EXPECT WIND AROUND 10 TO 15 KNOTS FROM THE SE TO CONTINUE TONIGHT. SCEC HAS BEEN DROPPED AS A RESULT. LONG FETCH OF SE WINDS STILL SUPPORTS ELEVATED SEAS AROUND 5 FT TONIGHT. OTHERWISE EXPECT WINDS TO REMAIN AROUND 10-15 KTS FOR MUCH OF THE WEEK WITH MAYBE WINDS AROUND 15KTS DURING THE NIGHT. SEAS SHOULD SUBSIDE A FOOT OR TWO OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS BUT REMAIN AROUND MODERATE LEVELS.  39  
TX...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK UNTIL 7 AM CDT MONDAY FOR THE FOLLOWING      ZONES: BRAZORIA...CHAMBERS...GALVESTON...MATAGORDA.  GM...SMALL CRAFT SHOULD EXERCISE CAUTION UNTIL 7 AM CDT MONDAY FOR      THE FOLLOWING ZONES: GALVESTON BAY...MATAGORDA BAY...WATERS      FROM FREEPORT TO THE MATAGORDA SHIP CHANNEL 20 NM TO 60      NM...WATERS FROM FREEPORT TO THE MATAGORDA SHIP CHANNEL OUT      20 NM...WATERS FROM HIGH ISLAND TO FREEPORT 20 TO 60 NM...      WATERS FROM HIGH ISLAND TO FREEPORT OUT 20 NM.  
VFR EXPECTED TO PERSIST OUTSIDE OF CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY. STORMS ARE EXPECTED TO FIRE MONDAY AFTERNOON AOA 00Z/TUE TO THE SW OF THE KLBB AND KCDS TERMINALS THEN OVERSPREAD THE REGION. THERE STANDS A GOOD CHANCE THAT ALL THREE TERMINALS WILL BE IMPACTED BY STORMS. DUE TO TIMING ISSUES...HAVE LEFT THE EXPLICIT MENTION OF CB FOR NOW AND WILL REFINE THE FCST AS MORE DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE.  
VFR CONDITIONS PREVAIL NOW...BUT AS MOISTURE MOVES BACK TO THE NORTH...MVFR CIGS WILL DEVELOP OVER THE METROPLEX BY 9-10Z. ENOUGH LOW LEVEL COOLING HAS OCCURRED THIS EVENING WITH THE LIGHT WINDS AND CLEAR SKIES THAT IT RAISES THE POTENTIAL FOR IFR CIGS AROUND SUNRISE...BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW SO WILL SHOW THIS IN A TEMPO FROM 11-14Z. CIGS WILL LIFT TO VFR AROUND MIDDAY WITH GENERALLY VFR EXPECTED THEREAFTER. SOUTH WINDS WILL CONTINUE AT 5-10KT THROUGH MORNING...BUT THEY BECOME MORE EASTERLY MONDAY AFTERNOON.  WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH FOR CONVECTION THAT MAY DEVELOP EAST AND SOUTHEAST OF THE TAF SITES LATE TONIGHT OR EARLY MONDAY MORNING...BUT THIS ACTIVITY WOULD PROBABLY BE TOO FAR EAST TO AFFECT TERMINALS. THE AIRMASS WILL ALSO BE UNCAPPED AND UNSTABLE MONDAY AFTERNOON FOR SOME CONVECTION TO DEVELOP BUT ORGANIZED FORCING LOOKS LIMITED AND THEREFORE THE PROBABILITY OF CONVECTION IMPACTING AIRPORTS LOOKS TOO LOW TO MENTION.  TR.92  
THE EVENING WEATHER BALLOON CONFIRMS THAT MUCH DRIER AIR ALOFT HAS MOVED INTO THE REGION FROM THE WEST AND NORTHWEST. THE MAIN AXIS OF MOISTURE HAS SHIFTED TO THE SOUTHEASTERN PARTS OF THE REGION...WHERE GOES SOUNDER DEPICTS THE PRECIPITABLE WATER AXIS EXTENDING FROM SAN ANTONIO TO COLLEGE STATION TO SHREVEPORT. THIS POOL OF MOISTURE WILL TEND TO GRADUALLY MOVE NORTHWESTWARD DURING THE OVERNIGHT AND MORNING HOURS. MEANWHILE A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS PUSHING THROUGH THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AT THIS TIME...BUT AGAIN LIMITED MOISTURE OVER THE REGION MEANS THERE HAS BEEN A LACK OF CONVECTION SO FAR WITH THIS FEATURE. THE TAIL END OF THIS FORCING MAY INTERACT WITH THE INCREASING MOISTURE LATE TONIGHT TO HELP IGNITE A FEW SHOWERS AND STORMS ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN PARTS OF THE CWA. THIS ACTIVITY MAY INCREASE IN COVERAGE AFTER SUNRISE. FOR THE EVENING UPDATE HAVE LOWERED POPS FOR ALL AREAS EXCEPT FOR THE EASTERN AND SOUTHEASTERN ZONES. CLEAR SKIES...DRIER AIR ALOFT AND LIGHT WINDS ALSO NECESSITATES LOWERING LOW TEMPS A BIT OVER THE CENTRAL AND NORTHWESTERN ZONES WHERE RADIATIONAL COOLING WILL BE A LITTLE BETTER.  TR.92  
MORE OFF AND ON RAIN CHANCES TO COME THIS WEEK...AS NORTH TEXAS REMAINS UNDER AN ACTIVE SOUTHWEST FLOW REGIME ALOFT. YESTERDAY/S UPPER LOW IS NOW NEGATIVELY TILTING UP OVER IA/MN THIS AFTERNOON WHILE ANOTHER SHORTWAVE EMBEDDED IN THE FAST FLOW OVER AZ/NM/AND NORTHERN MEXICO APPROACHES THIS EVENING. CURRENTLY...SUBSIDENCE IS OCCURRING IN WAKE OF THIS MORNING/S STORM COMPLEX. THE ATMOSPHERE SHOULD RE-DESTABILIZE THIS AFTERNOON AS STRONG HEATING OCCURS WITH HIGHS WARMING WELL INTO THE 70S TO EVEN LOWER 80S ACROSS THE FAR WESTERN CWA. THUNDERSTORM CHANCES WILL RETURN LATER THIS EVENING INTO EARLY MONDAY MORNING AS THE SHORTWAVE TO THE WEST ARRIVES AND MOVES ACROSS THE AREA. BEST RAIN CHANCES WILL BE ACROSS THE EAST AND CANNOT RULE OUT A STRONG TO SEVERE STORM OR TWO ALONG WITH LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINS AGAIN...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHEAST AREAS. THIS ACTIVITY IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE AS INTENSE AS THIS PAST MORNING/S CONVECTION...BUT SOMETHING TO BE AWARE OF WITH MANY SATURATED AREAS AROUND NORTH TEXAS. HAVE DECIDED NOT TO ISSUE A FLASH FLOOD WATCH WITH CONFIDENCE WAVERING ON STORM COVERAGE IN THE WAKE OF TODAY/S SUBSIDENCE AND RAINFALL AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN MOSTLY BELOW AN INCH. THE SHORTWAVE SHOULD PULL EAST AWAY FROM THE AREA BY MONDAY AFTERNOON WITH LINGERING RAIN CHANCES ACROSS CENTRAL TEXAS AND OUR SE COUNTIES.  A BROAD UPPER TROUGH WILL REMAIN OVER THE WESTERN U.S THROUGH MUCH OF THE WEEK...WITH OCCASIONAL SHORTWAVE DISTURBANCES MOVING READILY ACROSS THE AREA. THE HIGHEST RAIN CHANCES WILL BE ACROSS THE FAR N/NW COUNTIES AND NORTH OF I-20 THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK AS A SURFACE FRONTAL BOUNDARY STALLS NEAR OR NORTH OF THE RED RIVER WITH A THE UPPER RIDGE BEING MORE STOUT ACROSS CENTRAL TEXAS WITH LOWER RAIN CHANCES. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL EVENTUALLY SAG SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE RED RIVER VALLEY INTO NORTH TEXAS BY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WITH MAINLY DIURNAL RAIN CHANCES ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA. AS NOTED BY THE SATURATED SOIL ACROSS THE REGION...FLOODING WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE MAIN CONCERN WITH THE SEVERE THREAT REMAINING MARGINAL EACH DAY WITH SHORTWAVE RIDGING OCCURRING INTO THE END OF THE WEEK AND INTO NEXT WEEKEND. VERY WARM AND MUGGY MID-LATE MAY CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST THROUGH MID WEEK WITH HIGHS IN THE 80S AND LOWS IN THE UPPER 60S/LOWER 70S. SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPERATURES ARE ON TAP FOR LATE WEEK WITH THE WEAK FRONT...BUT CAA WILL NOT BE SIGNIFICANT. THERE IS HOPE THAT AN UPPER RIDGE WILL STRENGTHEN LATE NEXT WEEKEND INTO THE FOLLOWING WEEK WHICH MAY FINALLY HELP THE AREA DRY OUT SOMEWHAT.  05/    
/06Z TAFS/ Low level moisture will make a return late tonight as dryline advances back to the west. Stratus will spread north across the area, with MVFR ceilings at the southern terminals by 07Z and the KABI terminal by 12Z. The KABI terminal may see only scattered low clouds, however still have a few hours of MVFR in the TAF. The low clouds will break up by late Monday morning and VFR conditions will prevail during the afternoon and evening.  
UPDATE...  Rain chances for the remainder of tonight do not look good. Thus, the latest forecast package has no weather across West Central Texas for the remainder of tonight.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 610 PM CDT Sun May 17 2015/  AVIATION... /00Z TAFS/ Expect VFR conditions this evening across West Central Texas. Low level moisture will make a return late tonight as dryline advances back to the west. Stratus will spread north across the area, with MVFR ceilings at southern terminals by 07Z and the KABI terminal by 12Z. The KABI terminal may see only scattered low clouds, however still have a few hours of MVFR in the TAF. The low clouds will break up by late Monday morning and VFR conditions will prevail during the afternoon.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 346 PM CDT Sun May 17 2015/  SHORT TERM... (Tonight and Monday)  Much quieter weather expected over the next 24 hours than the last 24. Currently, skies are mainly clear across west central Texas with west/southwesterly flow aloft. There is one shortwave is currently moving east into the eastern half of the state, while another shortwave can be seen moving quickly east/northeast through eastern New Mexico and into west Texas. Subsidence on the backside of the first shortwave is resulting in a lack of activity this afternoon, but as the next shortwave interacts with a northwestward moving dryline this evening, we could see isolated thunderstorms develop mainly south and east of a Cross Plains to Ozona line. As the dryline moves northwest, instability will increase, and 0-6km shear is currently greater than 40 knots, so if thunderstorms do develop, they could potentially become strong to marginally severe. However, the potential for severe weather is diminished by the low confidence in thunderstorms developing.  On Monday, showers and thunderstorms may develop again, especially over the higher terrain to our west as another shortwave moves into the area, and interacts with the dryline. Most of the activity should stay west through the afternoon hours, but we may see some of these thunderstorms approach our western counties by late afternoon or early evening. The thunderstorms will be enhanced by diffluent flow aloft, and good instability in the low levels, so severe weather will again be a possibility with large hail and damaging winds being the main hazards. However, most of this activity should remain west of our area, as storms will likely weaken after moving east off the higher terrain.  Expect lows tonight mainly in the 60s with highs tomorrow warming into the mid to upper 80s.  LONG TERM... (Monday night through Sunday)  Southwest flow aloft will continue through the work work into the weekend. There will be a chance of showers and thunderstorms each day. Best chance of rain will be late Monday night into Tuesday, and Wednesday night into Thursday, as upper shortwaves coincide with weak cold fronts moving into the Big Country. GFS SB CAPES are in the 2000 to 3000 J/KG range, so a few severe thunderstorms possible. Some localized flooding also possible, mainly in the Big Country as the weak cold front focuses heavy rainfall. Next weekend, both the EC and GFS bring the southwest upper trough farther east, which would bring in cooler and more unstable air aloft over West Central Texas. This will allow a continuation of showers and thunderstorms and perhaps enhanced severe potential.  
VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED FOR THE FIRST 18 HOURS WITH INCREASING LOW CLOUDS AND CONVECTION POSSIBLE IN THE FINAL 6 HOURS. COLD FRONT TIMING REMAINS UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS ISSUANCE...BETWEEN 08Z AND 13Z MONDAY. AFTER 00Z TUESDAY FORECAST CONFIDENCE GREATLY DECREASES. CONVECTION SHOULD START SOUTHWEST OF THE PANHANDLES AND SPREAD NORTHEASTWARD WITH TIME. THIS WILL GIVE KAMA AND KDHT BETTER CHANCES TO BE IMPACTED DURING THIS TAF ISSUANCE. CONFIDENCE IS MODERATE THAT CONVECTION SHOULD IMPACT THE TERMINALS BETWEEN 03Z AND 12Z TUESDAY. HAVE STARTED A DECLINING TREND OF CEILING BASES AND VISIBILITIES GIVEN THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHEN CONVECTION WILL IMPACT THE TERMINALS DIRECTLY.  
AVIATION... VFR CONDITIONS TO PREVAIL FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS AT ALL TERMINALS. A COLD FRONT WILL BRING A WIND SHIFT TO EACH TERMINAL BETWEEN 08Z AND 13Z MONDAY. WINDS WILL SLOWLY SHIFT BACK TOWARDS THE EAST BY THE END OF THIS TAF ISSUANCE.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 427 PM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015/  DISCUSSION...  AN ACTIVE PATTERN IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANCES WERE NEEDED TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.  IN THE SHORT TERM A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE AREA DURING THE EARLY MORNING. LITTLE IMPACT IS EXPECTED. WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE NORTHEAST AND INCREASE. SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPERATURES WILL ARRIVE BEHIND THE FRONT RESULTING IN TEMPERATURES TOMORROW BEING A FEW DEGREES COOLER OVER THE NORTHERN COUNTIES. THIS BOUNDARY WILL BECOME DIFFUSE DURING THE DAY AND WINDS WILL VEER AROUND TO SOUTHEASTERLY AT MOST LOCATIONS AS LEE SURFACE TROUGH STRENGTHENS IN RESPONSE TO THE NEXT UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM APPROACHING FROM THE WEST. THIS WILL START THE NORTHWESTWARD MOVEMENT OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE CURRENTLY IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN TEXAS. LARGE SCALE ASCENT AND MOISTURE ADVECTION SHOULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY ACROSS THE AREA. TRIED TO CONVEY SOME TEMPORAL DETAIL ALTHOUGH UNCERTAINTY STILL EXISTS. THE STRONGEST PERIOD OF ISENTROPIC LIFT AND SATURATION THROUGH A DEEP LAYER OCCURS FROM LATE EVENING IN THE SOUTHWEST THROUGH EARLY MORNING IN THE EAST. THEREAFTER UNRESOLVED DETAILS ON THE MESOSCALE WILL BE KEY IN HOW THINGS EVOLVED DURING THE DAY TUESDAY JUST AS WAS THE CASE THIS PAST SATURDAY. NAM IS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH DIURNAL DESTABILIZATION IN THE WAKE OF MORNING CONVECTION AND SHOWS FAVORABLE THERMODYNAMIC PROFILES FOR ADDITIONAL MORE ROBUST CONVECTION PERHAPS OF A SCATTERED NATURE BY AFTERNOON. DEEP LAYER SHEAR AROUND 50 KNOTS AND BACKED LOW LEVEL WINDS WILL BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR SUSTAINED STORMS AND A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM POTENTIAL. THE FLOOD THREAT APPEARS LOW SIMILAR TO THE LAST SEVERAL SYSTEMS. FOR THE 36 HOUR PERIOD WITH THE HIGHEST PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES IT APPEARS THAT RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL GENERALLY RANGE FROM AN INCH TO AN INCH AND A HALF ACROSS THE AREA.  RETAINED LOW PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY ALTHOUGH THIS PERIOD MAY BE DRIER THAN CURRENTLY INDICATED. NAM AND ECMWF ARE MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH SOUTHWARD MOVEMENT OF COLD FRONT AND COOLER/DRIER AIR MASS MOVING INTO THE AREA BEHIND IT COMPARED TO THE WETTER GFS. WINDS BECOME SOUTHEASTERLY AND STRENGTHEN THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY SIGNALING THE APPROACH OF YET ANOTHER SYSTEM. PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES ARE HIGHEST IN THE LONG TERM FROM THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING.  BRB  
ALONG A LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE ZONE FROM EASTERN NUEVO LEON SOUTH THROUGH WESTERN TAMAULIPAS...THINGS HAVE QUICKLY QUIETED DOWN THIS EVENING AND NO ADDITIONAL ACTION IS EXPECTED NEAR THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY NORTHERN RANCHLANDS OVERNIGHT. WILL REMOVE MENTIONABLE PRECIPITATION OVERNIGHT FOR ALL AREAS AND TOUCH UP CLOUD COVER A BIT...OTHERWISE FORECAST IS ON TRACK.  
PACKAGE FROM THE 18Z PACKAGE. SHOULD BE JUST ENOUGH WIND TO KEEP THINGS MIXED TO THE BASE OF THE INVERSION...WHICH SETTLES IN JUST ABOVE IFR AROUND 1200 FEET BY 06Z AND CONTINUES THROUGH 14/15Z AT ALL TERMINALS. ALL MODELS SHOW SUFFICIENT DRYING AND SEPARATION AT THE CLOUD BASE BY AFTERNOON MONDAY...UNLIKE TODAY...WHICH WILL BRING SCATTERED 3500-4500 FOOT CLOUDS BY NOON OR SO IN ALL AREAS. THE ADDITIONAL SUNSHINE SHOULD ALLOW SOME GUSTINESS...BUT NOTHING TOO CRAZY WITH GRADIENT HAVING SLACKENED AS TEXAS IS BETWEEN SYSTEMS.  
LESSER UPTICK IN OVERNIGHT GULF WINDS THAN IN RECENT DAYS. BUOY 20 STILL SUSTAINED BELOW 10 KNOTS AT 10 PM AND RESEARCH BUOY 40 NM EAST OF SOUTH PADRE SIMILAR A FEW HOURS EARLIER. WE MAY REACH A FEW HOURS OF CAUTION BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND 4 AM...BUT FOR NOW WILL HOLD FORECAST JUST SHY ON THE AVERAGE AND KEEP SEAS UNDER 6 FEET ON THE AVERAGE AS WELL. LAGUNA MADRE WINDS SHOULD REMAIN FRESH BUT GENERALLY BELOW 15 KNOTS EXCEPT FOR GUSTS OVERNIGHT. 52/BSG  
SHORT TERM /NOW THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT/...A CONVECTIVE LINE OVER EAST CENTRAL TEXAS SHOULD CONTINUE MOVING TOWARD THE EAST...BUT INFLOW OVER THE CWA HAS DEVELOPED INTO WEAK SHOWER ACTIVITY OVER KENEDY COUNTY AND NOW THE MID VALLEY. SLIGHTLY DEEPER CONVECTION...WITH A FEW TSTMS IN THE MIX...WILL BE POSSIBLE THROUGH EARLY EVENING WITH SURFACE DEW POINTS IN THE MID 70S...THOUGH A WEAK CAP AND DRIER AIR ALOFT MAY PUT THE KIBOSH ON ANY MORE SIGNIFICANT WEATHER. MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES WILL PREVAIL TONIGHT...WITH LOW TEMPS REMAINING ABOVE NORMAL IN THE MID 70S.  THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STORM SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE NORTHEAST AND H5 RIDGING WILL BUILD OVER THE HIGH PLAINS IN THE SHORT TERM. HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE SOUTH OUT OF THE CANADIAN PLAINS AND INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ON MONDAY. THE TRAJECTORY WILL TAKE THE AIR MASS SLASH FRONT EAST WHERE THE BOUNDARY WILL MOVE TOWARD THE NORTH GULF COAST...BUT MAY NEVER OR WILL JUST BARELY GET THERE. MONDAY HIGH TEMPS WILL CONTINUE TO TREND ABOVE NORMAL...IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S...WITH ABOVE NORMAL MID 70S FOR LOW TEMPERATURES MONDAY NIGHT. LIGHT TO MODERATE SOUTHEAST WINDS WILL PREVAIL WITH A MIX OF CLOUDS AND SUN.  LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...LONG TERM PERIOD IS DOMINATED BY RIDGING BUILDING IN FROM THE EAST AS THE NEXT H5 TROUGH MOVES MORE NORTHWARD INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS. MODELS INDICATE THE MOISTURE WILL BE MORE LIMITED...WITH PW VALUES REMAINING BELOW 1.5 INCHES THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON. THESE FACTORS WILL LEAD TO A DRY AND WARMER FORECAST FOR TUESDAY TO THURSDAY...WITH HIGHS IN THE LOWER 90S. SHORTWAVES ROTATING AROUND THE NEXT H5 TROUGH ACROSS THE DESERT SOUTHWEST WILL START TO TAP SLOWLY INCREASING MOISTURE TO TRY TO SPARK SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LATE IN THE WEEK. THERE IS AN OUTSIDE CHANCE THAT SHOWERS COULD START OUT WEST THURSDAY AFTERNOON...BUT MORE LIKELIHOOD DURING THE DAY FRIDAY AND INTO NEXT WEEKEND.  MARINE... NOW THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL INTERACT WITH PERSISTENT LOWER PRESSURE INLAND TO PRODUCE MODERATE TO STRONG SOUTHEAST WINDS AND HIGHER SEAS ALONG THE LOWER TEXAS COAST THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. EXERCISE CAUTION CONDITIONS ON THE GULF MAY BECOME LOW END SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS BY LATE THIS EVE...PERSISTING UNTIL SOMETIME MONDAY MORNING. DUE TO THE BORDER LINE FCST...OPTED TO LET THE NEXT SHIFT TAKE A SECOND LOOK BEFORE MAKING A FINAL DECISION ON ISSUING A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY.  TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...WINDS WILL BEGIN THE PERIOD IN THE 15 TO 20 KNOT RANGE DUE TO GRADIENT BETWEEN EXPANSIVE HIGH ACROSS THE EASTERN US AND LOW PRESSURE ACROSS THE ROCKIES. THIS WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH SEAS ABOVE 5 FEET THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON. STARTING WEDNESDAY THE LOW PRESSURE STARTS TO WEAKEN...WITH SFC RIDGE BECOMING MORE DOMINANT ACROSS THE WESTERN GULF. THIS WILL PULL WINDS DOWN TO 10 TO 15 KNOTS...WITH SEAS LOWERING TO AROUND 3 FEET.  
THE RIO GRANDE PLAINS MAINLY NEAR THE US 83 CORRIDOR. STILL...FEEL RAIN AND THUNDERSTORM CHANCES ARE LOW WITH SOME CAVEATS. UPDATES ARE OUT AND FURTHER DETAILS CAN BE FOUND BELOW IN AN UPDATED DISCUSSION.  
INSTABILITY DOWN AND THUS OVERALL RENEWED TSTORM ACTIVITY AT BAY. FOR TONIGHT...DEEP SOUTHERLY FLOW CONTINUES ACROSS THE REGION WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW 70S AS THE DRY LINE RETREATS WESTWARD. LOW CLOUDS ARE ONGOING AND WILL LOWER THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT AND MORNING...ALLOWING FOR DRIZZLE/MIST ACROSS GOOD PORTION OF THE AREA. FEEL THIS IS THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO OUTSIDE OF WHAT HI- RES MODELS HAVE BEEN INDICATING. HRRR/NAM AND OTHER HI-RES GUIDANCE SUGGEST ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT OVERNIGHT IN THIS WARM AIR ADVECTION REGIME. TWO ISSUES AT HAND APPEAR TO BE LACK OF ANY LOW-LVL TRIGGER OR BOUNDARY AND HOW A PARCEL WILL RISE OVER THE CAP. SOME MODELS LEAN TOWARDS THE CAP ERODING BUT NOT SURE SURFACE PARCELS WOULD READILY LIFT DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS WITH NO FOCUS AND WEAK ISENTROPIC ASCENT. NAM/GFS DO HINT AT A WEAK H7 S/WV MOVING OVER THE REGION MIDNIGHT TO 7AM THIS COULD BE ENOUGH TO HELP LIFT PARCELS. AS SUCH...DO NOT HAVE MUCH CONFIDENCE IN WIDER COVERAGE OF TSTORMS DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT BUT HAVE PLACED BEST CHANCES ALONG US 83 CORRIDOR WHERE THE WAVE WOULD BEST COINCIDE WITH UPSLOPE FLOW AROUND A WEAK SFC-H850 LOW ALONG THE RIO GRANDE RIVER. MONDAY WILL BE A TRICKY DAY AS WELL GIVEN SUBTLE WAVES MOVING OVER THE REGION BUT SOME NEGATIVE THETAE ADVECTION LOOKS TO INFILTRATE NORTH ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST PORTION OF THE REGION THAT SHOULD KEEP COVERAGE OF TSTORMS LOWER THERE. THERE IS SOME HINT IN THE EC THAT A POTENTIAL COMPLEX COULD CROSS THE RIO GRANDE LATE TOMORROW AND THAT WILL NEED TO BE MONITORED FOR ADDITIONAL FLASH FLOODING CONCERNS.  
AVIATION.../00Z TAFS/ SOUTHEAST FLOW AND WEAK ASCENT WILL CAUSE MVFR-VFR CIGS TO LOWER TO IFR BY 05Z AT SAT/SSF AND 09Z AT DRT...WHILE AUS FURTHER NORTH OF THE MAIN ASCENT WILL BE BORDERLINE IFR-MVFR. MODELS SUGGEST ISOLATED SHRA AND TSRA ARE POSSIBLE TONIGHT AT ALL SITES...BUT A WEAK DISTURBANCE MOVING THROUGH HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO OVERCOME AN ATMOSPHERE THAT IS WORKED OVER FROM THIS MORNINGS STORMS THUS FAR. LIFR CIGS MAY ALSO BRIEFLY OCCUR BETWEEN 10-14Z AT SAT/SSF AND DRT...BUT CONFIDENCE WAS TOO LOW TO INCLUDE AT THIS TIME. SEVERAL MODELS SUGGEST THAT ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHRA AND TSRA WILL DEVELOP OFF THE MEXICAN MOUNTAINS FOR DRT AND ALONG AN EAST-WEST ORIENTED REGION OF ASCENT FOR SAT/SSF/AUS TOMORROW...BUT WILL WAIT TO SEE IF THE UPCOMING MODEL CYCLE TRENDS WETTER OR DRIER.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 316 PM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015/  SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)... A MCS MODIFIED AIR MASS WILL LIMIT MUCH OF THE CONVECTION FOR TONIGHT...ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE MODEL DATA CONTINUES TO SUPPORT SCATTERED CONVECTION AND SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL AMOUNTS. WILL UNDERCUT POPS TO MAINLY SLIGHT CHANCES...WITH ONLY A SMALL REGION OF SLIGHTLY ENHANCED POPS OVER THE RIO GRANDE PLAINS. A SMALL OUTFLOW BOUNDARY LOCATED IN THIS AREA COULD TAP INTO DAYTIME HEATING THIS EVENING...WITH INCREASING STABILITY EXPECTED TONIGHT. IF A STRONG CELL DOES DEVELOP THIS EVENING...LIGHT WESTERLY STEERING FLOW SHOULD LEAD TO SHORT-LIVED CONVECTION. THE HRRR GENERATES OVERNIGHT CONVECTION OVER CENTRAL COUNTIES FROM THE LLJ ENHANCED RETURN FLOW OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...BUT EXPECT MORE IN THE LINE OF SPRINKLES OR DRIZZLE AFTER MIDNIGHT. RAIN CHANCES SHOULD PICK UP AGAIN MONDAY...BUT BOUNDARY INTERACTIONS SHOULD BE MORE FAVORABLE WELL TO THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST. THUS WILL KEEP LOW END CHANCE POPS WHICH IS STILL DOWN FROM THE SYNOPTIC MODELS THAT ARE ROUGHLY 20 PERCENT HIGHER ON POPS. BY MONDAY NIGHT...CONVERGENCE TO MODEL CONSENSUS IS REASONABLE WITH POPS STILL FAVORED TO THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST BASED ON CONVECTIVE INITIATION MOSTLY FAVORED TO THE NW.  LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)... TUESDAY INTO THURSDAY REMAINS AN INTERESTING PERIOD WITH MOST OF THE SYNOPTIC MODELS SHIFTING IN FAVOR OF A FRONTAL ZONE REACHING CENTRAL TX. WITH THE NEXT MID TO UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH EJECTION...EXPECTED TO MOVE FROM NRN MEXICO INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS...SHOWN TO BE MORE SHALLOW AND FARTHER NW THAN THE PREVIOUS COUPLE OF DISTURBANCES...AM STILL IN FAVOR OF CONSERVATIVE POPS WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS TO THE NORTH. BY THURSDAY...REPEATED ROUNDS OF THUNDERSTORMS OVER NORTH TEXAS SHOULD ENABLE ENOUGH BOUNDARY POOLING TO ENHANCE RAIN CHANCES INTO THE WEEKEND...THOUGH THE BLEND OF MODEL DATA ONLY SHOWS A SUBTLE EASTERLY SHIFT IN WINDS. LATER RUNS SHOULD BE ABLE TO FURTHER CLARIFY WHETHER A FRONT MAKES INTO THE AREA...AND WITH THAT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING IF NEW FLASH FLOOD OR POSSIBLE SEVERE THREATS WERE TO COME ABOUT. TEMPERATURES ARE ALSO AT THE MERCY OF THESE EVER CHANGING BOUNDARY AND THUNDERSTORM INDUCED CLOUD AREAS...SO A BLENDED GUIDANCE APPROACH TO THE FORECAST CONTINUES WITH CONTINUED HUMID AND MILD CONDITIONS.  
THE ISOLATED SHOWERS WHICH HAD DEVELOPED AFTER SUNSET TOWARD THE COAST HAVE DIMINISHED. THE 00Z NAM HAS AN UPPER DIFFLUENT ZONE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET OVER THE MS VALLEY INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS... AND A DEPARTING 500 MB VORTICITY AREA MOVING OUT OF THE STATE. THE HI RESOLUTION MODELS ARE HINTING AT REDEVELOPMENT OVERNIGHT TONIGHT AND INTO MONDAY MORNING OVER THE WESTERN COUNTIES. THE NAMBUFR SOUNDING FORECASTS ARE SHOWING A BIT OF A CAP FORMING IN THE WAKE OF THE STORMS FROM EARLIER TODAY...SO THINK THAT IF SHOWERS DO DEVELOP THAT THE COVERAGE WILL BE ISOLATED AT BEST FOR MOST LOCATIONS. TWEAKED THE EVENING COVERAGE. GIVEN THE LATEST MODEL OUTPUT...FELT THAT THE CHANCE POPS IN THE NORTH ARE GOOD FOR AT LEAST LATE IN THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD.  40  
AVIATION... EXPECTING SUBSIDENCE IN THE WAKE OF TODAY`S STORMS TO KEEP THE AREA MOSTLY FREE OF SHRA/TSRA DEVELOPMENT THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. WATER VAPOR SATELLITE LOOP DOES SHOW POSSIBLE DISTURBANCE AND ASSOCIATED SPEED MAX HEADING THIS WAY FROM THE WEST SOUTHWEST...BUT NOT SURE THIS WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO GENERATE ANY SIGNIFICANT SHRA/TSRA COVERAGE. MVFR CEILINGS ARE ALREADY MOVING INLAND AT GLS AND LBX...AND THINK THEY SHOULD CONTINUE SPREADING INLAND DURING THE REST OF THE EVENING/OVERNIGHT HOURS. MAYBE WET GROUND COULD HELP TO BRING SOME TAF SITES IFR LEVEL CEILINGS/ VISIBILITIES...BUT NOT REAL CONFIDENT THAT THIS WILL MATERIALIZE. MVFR CEILINGS COULD LINGER AROUND DURING THE MORNING HOURS TOMORROW...THEN WE SHOULD SEE SCT/BKN DECK AROUND 5000 FEET IN THE AFTERNOON WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME SHRA/TSRA. FOR THE 18/00Z TAFS...CHOSE TO STICK WITH VCSH FOR NOW.  42  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 412 PM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015/  DISCUSSION... BUSY WEATHER AFTERNOON FOR SOUTHEAST TEXAS AS A LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUES TO PUSH ACROSS THE REGION. AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ACTIVITY STRETCHED FROM BRAZORIA COUNTY ALONG THE UPPER TEXAS COAST AND INTO LIBERTY COUNTY AS OF 3 PM CDT... AND GUSTY WINDS /AS WELL AS SOME BRIEF LOW LEVEL STORM ROTATION/ WAS NOTED AS THE REMAINDER OF THE LINE CONTINUED TO PUSH EASTWARD. EXPECT THE LINE TO CONTINUE TO PUSH EAST WITH THE BEST INSTABILITY LOCATED AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM /LAPS SHOWING 2000-3000 J/KG/ OVER CENTRAL LOUISIANA AND EXTRAPOLATION PLACES THIS LINE CLEAR OF THE FORECAST AREA BETWEEN 5 AND 7 PM CDT... ALTHOUGH A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS WILL CERTAINLY BE POSSIBLE. FOR THE REMAINDER OF TONIGHT... A MORE STABILIZED AIRMASS IN THE WAKE OF THIS SYSTEM WILL HELP LOWER RAIN CHANCES ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION /GENERALLY 10-20 POPS/ WITH THE PRESENCE OF A 20 TO 25 KNOT LOW LEVEL JET POSSIBLY BEING ENOUGH TO GENERATE A FEW STREAMER SHOWERS. AN INCREASE IN RAIN CHANCES OVER THE NORTHERN ZONES OCCURS TOWARDS SUNRISE MONDAY AS AN UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE APPROACHES THE REGION FROM THE WEST. OTHERWISE... EXPECT PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES OVERNIGHT WITH LOWS IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S.  AS STORMS APPROACH THE REGION ON MONDAY... NORTHERN ZONES WILL CONTINUE TO NEED TO BE MONITORED FOR POTENTIAL FLOODING CONCERNS WITH FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOWING PWATS REMAINING NEAR 1.6 TO 1.8 INCHES. WITH THE ADDITIONAL FAVORED AREAS FOR CONVECTION ON MONDAY WILL CENTER AROUND RESIDUAL BOUNDARIES FROM TODAY/S ACTIVITY... AIDED BY DAYTIME HEATING AND LIFT FROM THE PASSING SHORTWAVE. A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPROACHES THE REGION LATE MONDAY INTO EARLY TUESDAY AND THIS WILL SERVE AS ANOTHER FOCUSING MECHANISM FOR ADDITIONAL SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT... ALTHOUGH THE DETAILS ARE STILL A LITTLE FUZZY ON HOW FAR SOUTH THIS FEATURE WILL ACTUALLY MAKE IT /WITH CLIMATOLOGY NOT FAVORING THE FRONT TO REACH THE AREA/. BROAD TROUGHING WILL REMAIN OVER THE WESTERN CONUS THROUGH THE WEEK... BUT A BUILDING 500 MB RIDGE WILL ALLOW THE REGION TO FALL UNDER A MORE QUASI-ZONAL FLOW ALOFT /EFFECTIVELY SHIFTING THE TRAJECTORY OF PASSING DISTURBANCES FARTHER NORTH AND HELPING REDUCE RAIN CHANCES MID- WEEK/. ANOTHER LOW APPROACHES THE REGION BY NEXT WEEKEND... WITH RAIN CHANCES INCREASING CORRESPONDINGLY.  HUFFMAN  MARINE...  SOUTHERLY WINDS HAVE DECREASED DUE TO CONVECTION INLAND THAT HAS WEAKENED THE PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS THE AREA. THERE MAY BE SOME OUTFLOW WINDS ON GALVESTON BAY AND JUST OFF THE COAST BUT OVERALL EXPECT WIND AROUND 10 TO 15 KNOTS FROM THE SE TO CONTINUE TONIGHT. SCEC HAS BEEN DROPPED AS A RESULT. LONG FETCH OF SE WINDS STILL SUPPORTS ELEVATED SEAS AROUND 5 FT TONIGHT. OTHERWISE EXPECT WINDS TO REMAIN AROUND 10-15 KTS FOR MUCH OF THE WEEK WITH MAYBE WINDS AROUND 15KTS DURING THE NIGHT. SEAS SHOULD SUBSIDE A FOOT OR TWO OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS BUT REMAIN AROUND MODERATE LEVELS.  39  
TX...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK UNTIL 7 AM CDT MONDAY FOR THE FOLLOWING      ZONES: BRAZORIA...CHAMBERS...GALVESTON...MATAGORDA.  GM...NONE. 
/ISSUED 650 PM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015/ SOME MODELS ARE INITIATING CONVECTION WEST OF THE TAF SITES IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS BUT CUMULUS FIELD LOOKS UNIMPRESSIVE AND THE WINDOW FOR SUCH ACTIVITY APPEARS TO BE CLOSING. OTHERWISE WILL WATCH FOR CONVECTION THAT MAY DEVELOP EAST OF THE METROPLEX LATER TONIGHT...BUT THIS ACTIVITY WOULD PROBABLY BE TOO FAR EAST TO AFFECT TERMINALS. THE AIRMASS WILL ALSO BE UNCAPPED AND UNSTABLE MONDAY AFTERNOON FOR SOME CONVECTION TO DEVELOP BUT ORGANIZED FORCING LOOKS LIMITED AND THEREFORE THE PROBABILITY OF CONVECTION IMPACTING AIRPORTS LOOKS TOO LOW TO MENTION.  OTHERWISE VFR WILL PREVAIL THROUGH THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT HOURS WITH MVFR CIGS LIKELY DEVELOPING EARLY MONDAY MORNING. THESE CIGS WILL LIFT TO VFR AROUND MIDDAY...EVENTUALLY SCATTERING OUT DURING THE AFTERNOON. SOUTH WINDS WILL CONTINUE AT 5-10 KT TONIGHT...BUT WILL BACK TO THE EAST MONDAY AFTERNOON.  TR.92   
Rain chances for the remainder of tonight do not look good. Thus, the latest forecast package has no weather across West Central Texas for the remainder of tonight.  
AVIATION... /00Z TAFS/ Expect VFR conditions this evening across West Central Texas. Low level moisture will make a return late tonight as dryline advances back to the west. Stratus will spread north across the area, with MVFR ceilings at KJCT and KSOA terminals by 07Z and the KABI terminal by 12Z. The KABI terminal may see only scattered low clouds, however still have a few hours of MVFR in the TAF. The low clouds will break up by late Monday morning and VFR conditions will prevail during the afternoon.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 346 PM CDT Sun May 17 2015/  SHORT TERM... (Tonight and Monday)  Much quieter weather expected over the next 24 hours than the last 24. Currently, skies are mainly clear across west central Texas with west/southwesterly flow aloft. There is one shortwave is currently moving east into the eastern half of the state, while another shortwave can be seen moving quickly east/northeast through eastern New Mexico and into west Texas. Subsidence on the backside of the first shortwave is resulting in a lack of activity this afternoon, but as the next shortwave interacts with a northwestward moving dryline this evening, we could see isolated thunderstorms develop mainly south and east of a Cross Plains to Ozona line. As the dryline moves northwest, instability will increase, and 0-6km shear is currently greater than 40 knots, so if thunderstorms do develop, they could potentially become strong to marginally severe. However, the potential for severe weather is diminished by the low confidence in thunderstorms developing.  On Monday, showers and thunderstorms may develop again, especially over the higher terrain to our west as another shortwave moves into the area, and interacts with the dryline. Most of the activity should stay west through the afternoon hours, but we may see some of these thunderstorms approach our western counties by late afternoon or early evening. The thunderstorms will be enhanced by diffluent flow aloft, and good instability in the low levels, so severe weather will again be a possibility with large hail and damaging winds being the main hazards. However, most of this activity should remain west of our area, as storms will likely weaken after moving east off the higher terrain.  Expect lows tonight mainly in the 60s with highs tomorrow warming into the mid to upper 80s.  LONG TERM... (Monday night through Sunday)  Southwest flow aloft will continue through the work work into the weekend. There will be a chance of showers and thunderstorms each day. Best chance of rain will be late Monday night into Tuesday, and Wednesday night into Thursday, as upper shortwaves coincide with weak cold fronts moving into the Big Country. GFS SB CAPES are in the 2000 to 3000 J/KG range, so a few severe thunderstorms possible. Some localized flooding also possible, mainly in the Big Country as the weak cold front focuses heavy rainfall. Next weekend, both the EC and GFS bring the southwest upper trough farther east, which would bring in cooler and more unstable air aloft over West Central Texas. This will allow a continuation of showers and thunderstorms and perhaps enhanced severe potential.  
SOUTHEAST FLOW AND WEAK ASCENT WILL CAUSE MVFR-VFR CIGS TO LOWER TO IFR BY 05Z AT SAT/SSF AND 09Z AT DRT...WHILE AUS FURTHER NORTH OF THE MAIN ASCENT WILL BE BORDERLINE IFR-MVFR. MODELS SUGGEST ISOLATED SHRA AND TSRA ARE POSSIBLE TONIGHT AT ALL SITES...BUT A WEAK DISTURBANCE MOVING THROUGH HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO OVERCOME AN ATMOSPHERE THAT IS WORKED OVER FROM THIS MORNINGS STORMS THUS FAR. LIFR CIGS MAY ALSO BRIEFLY OCCUR BETWEEN 10-14Z AT SAT/SSF AND DRT...BUT CONFIDENCE WAS TOO LOW TO INCLUDE AT THIS TIME. SEVERAL MODELS SUGGEST THAT ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHRA AND TSRA WILL DEVELOP OFF THE MEXICAN MOUNTAINS FOR DRT AND ALONG AN EAST-WEST ORIENTED REGION OF ASCENT FOR SAT/SSF/AUS TOMORROW...BUT WILL WAIT TO SEE IF THE UPCOMING MODEL CYCLE TRENDS WETTER OR DRIER.   
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)... A MCS MODIFIED AIR MASS WILL LIMIT MUCH OF THE CONVECTION FOR TONIGHT...ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE MODEL DATA CONTINUES TO SUPPORT SCATTERED CONVECTION AND SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL AMOUNTS. WILL UNDERCUT POPS TO MAINLY SLIGHT CHANCES...WITH ONLY A SMALL REGION OF SLIGHTLY ENHANCED POPS OVER THE RIO GRANDE PLAINS. A SMALL OUTFLOW BOUNDARY LOCATED IN THIS AREA COULD TAP INTO DAYTIME HEATING THIS EVENING...WITH INCREASING STABILITY EXPECTED TONIGHT. IF A STRONG CELL DOES DEVELOP THIS EVENING...LIGHT WESTERLY STEERING FLOW SHOULD LEAD TO SHORT-LIVED CONVECTION. THE HRRR GENERATES OVERNIGHT CONVECTION OVER CENTRAL COUNTIES FROM THE LLJ ENHANCED RETURN FLOW OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...BUT EXPECT MORE IN THE LINE OF SPRINKLES OR DRIZZLE AFTER MIDNIGHT. RAIN CHANCES SHOULD PICK UP AGAIN MONDAY...BUT BOUNDARY INTERACTIONS SHOULD BE MORE FAVORABLE WELL TO THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST. THUS WILL KEEP LOW END CHANCE POPS WHICH IS STILL DOWN FROM THE SYNOPTIC MODELS THAT ARE ROUGHLY 20 PERCENT HIGHER ON POPS. BY MONDAY NIGHT...CONVERGENCE TO MODEL CONSENSUS IS REASONABLE WITH POPS STILL FAVORED TO THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST BASED ON CONVECTIVE INITIATION MOSTLY FAVORED TO THE NW.  LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)... TUESDAY INTO THURSDAY REMAINS AN INTERESTING PERIOD WITH MOST OF THE SYNOPTIC MODELS SHIFTING IN FAVOR OF A FRONTAL ZONE REACHING CENTRAL TX. WITH THE NEXT MID TO UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH EJECTION...EXPECTED TO MOVE FROM NRN MEXICO INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS...SHOWN TO BE MORE SHALLOW AND FARTHER NW THAN THE PREVIOUS COUPLE OF DISTURBANCES...AM STILL IN FAVOR OF CONSERVATIVE POPS WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS TO THE NORTH. BY THURSDAY...REPEATED ROUNDS OF THUNDERSTORMS OVER NORTH TEXAS SHOULD ENABLE ENOUGH BOUNDARY POOLING TO ENHANCE RAIN CHANCES INTO THE WEEKEND...THOUGH THE BLEND OF MODEL DATA ONLY SHOWS A SUBTLE EASTERLY SHIFT IN WINDS. LATER RUNS SHOULD BE ABLE TO FURTHER CLARIFY WHETHER A FRONT MAKES INTO THE AREA...AND WITH THAT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING IF NEW FLASH FLOOD OR POSSIBLE SEVERE THREATS WERE TO COME ABOUT. TEMPERATURES ARE ALSO AT THE MERCY OF THESE EVER CHANGING BOUNDARY AND THUNDERSTORM INDUCED CLOUD AREAS...SO A BLENDED GUIDANCE APPROACH TO THE FORECAST CONTINUES WITH CONTINUED HUMID AND MILD CONDITIONS.  
EASTERN SITES COULD BE IFR FOR A TIME IN THE EARLY MORNING. SHOULD IMPROVE CIGS MID TO LATE MORNING. LESS BREEZY CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST TOMORROW WITH VFR CONDITIONS DURING THE AFTERNOON FOR MOST SITES. VCT MAY STAY MVFR.  
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...MAIN ISSUE IN THE NEAR TERM IS CHANCES FOR CONVECTION LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. CONVECTION FROM EARLIER MCS HAS MOVED EAST OF THE AREA. STARTING TO SEE SOME ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY DEVELOP ALONG AND JUST WEST OF I37. HI RES MODELS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN BRINGING ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS NORTHWARD OUT OF DEEP SOUTH TEXAS LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS MOIST UNSTABLE AIRMASS INTERACTS WITH LEFTOVER BOUNDARIES. CONVECTION WOULD MOST LIKELY IMPACT THE BRUSH COUNTRY AND RIO GRANDE PLAINS. SPC MESOANALYSIS INCREASES MLCAPES BETWEEN 3000 AND 3500 J/KG OVER THESE AREAS...SO SOME CONCERN EXISTS THAT A FEW STRONG TO PERHAPS SEVERE STORMS COULD DEVELOP. MAIN HAZARDS WOULD BE LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS IF DEEP CONVECTION MATERIALIZES. IN ADDITION... LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL COULD FALL OVER THESE AREAS BUT CONFIDENCE IS NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO INCLUDE THIS IN THE FORECAST JUST YET. EXPECT A DOWNTREND IN CONVECTION AFTER 06Z AS STORMS MOVE NORTHWARD OUT OF THE AREA. FOR MONDAY...DEEPER MOISTURE AXIS WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE NORTHWEST PART OF THE AREA AND WILL KEEP SOME SLIGHT TO LOW END CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST. CONCERNING TEMPERATURES...HIGHS WILL BE ON THE WARM SIDE TOMORROW WITH LOWER 90S OUT WEST WITH MIDDLE TO UPPER 80S ELSEWHERE.  LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...GIVEN THE BETTER PERFORMANCE OF THE ECMWF WITH RESPECT TO OUR RECENT RAIN EVENTS...DECIDED TO LEAN HEAVILY TWDS ITS SOLN FOR THE EXTENDED FCST. INITIALLY HOWEVER NOT MUCH FORCING AND MARGINAL MOISTURE WL PREVAIL ON TUE AND WED ACROSS THE CWA.  WL CARRY SOME SLIGHT CHC POPS FOR BOTH DAYS ACROSS THE NRN PORTION OF THE CWA. OTHERWISE...MOST AREAS WL REMAIN DRY ON TUE/WED WITH A RETURN TO BREEZY/WINDY CONDITIONS...ESPECIALLY SOUTHERN AREAS.  AS THE NEXT FRONT MOVES SWD ACROSS NORTH AND CENTRAL TX WED NIGHT INTO THU...A POTENTIAL MCS MAY IMPACT THE BRUSH COUNTRY LATE WED NIGHT.  BETTER CHANCES WL LKLY EXIST ON THU AS THE FRONT MAKES ITS CLOSEST APPROACH JUST TO OUR NORTH.  INCREASED MOISTURE CONVERGENCE AND ADVECTION ALONG WITH A WK S/WV SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO WARRANT CHC POPS FOR MOST OF THE CWA ON THU.  SLIGHTLY LOWER POPS ARE EXPECTED ON FRI AND SAT AS THE FRONT MOVES BACK NORTH.  A STRONGER S/WV IS EXPECTED TO IMPACT THE CWA ON SUNDAY AND SO WL RAISE POPS AGAIN.  BEST CHANCES THROUGH MOST OF THE FCST PD WL REMAIN ACROSS THE BRUSH COUNTRY AND NORTHERN COASTAL BEND. TEMPS WL REMAIN NEAR CLIMO FOR TUE AND WED BUT WL DIP BELOW CLIMO ONCE AGAIN FROM THU ONWARD DUE TO INCREASED RAIN CHANCES AND THICKER CLOUD CVR.  
TX...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK THROUGH MONDAY EVENING FOR THE FOLLOWING      ZONES: ARANSAS...CALHOUN...KLEBERG...NUECES.  GM...NONE.  
SOME MODELS ARE INITIATING CONVECTION WEST OF THE TAF SITES IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS BUT CUMULUS FIELD LOOKS UNIMPRESSIVE AND THE WINDOW FOR SUCH ACTIVITY APPEARS TO BE CLOSING. OTHERWISE WILL WATCH FOR CONVECTION THAT MAY DEVELOP EAST OF THE METROPLEX LATER TONIGHT...BUT THIS ACTIVITY WOULD PROBABLY BE TOO FAR EAST TO AFFECT TERMINALS. THE AIRMASS WILL ALSO BE UNCAPPED AND UNSTABLE MONDAY AFTERNOON FOR SOME CONVECTION TO DEVELOP BUT ORGANIZED FORCING LOOKS LIMITED AND THEREFORE THE PROBABILITY OF CONVECTION IMPACTING AIRPORTS LOOKS TOO LOW TO MENTION.  OTHERWISE VFR WILL PREVAIL THROUGH THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT HOURS WITH MVFR CIGS LIKELY DEVELOPING EARLY MONDAY MORNING. THESE CIGS WILL LIFT TO VFR AROUND MIDDAY...EVENTUALLY SCATTERING OUT DURING THE AFTERNOON. SOUTH WINDS WILL CONTINUE AT 5-10 KT TONIGHT...BUT WILL BACK TO THE EAST MONDAY AFTERNOON.  TR.92  
MORE OFF AND ON RAIN CHANCES TO COME THIS WEEK...AS NORTH TEXAS REMAINS UNDER AN ACTIVE SOUTHWEST FLOW REGIME ALOFT. YESTERDAY/S UPPER LOW IS NOW NEGATIVELY TILTING UP OVER IA/MN THIS AFTERNOON WHILE ANOTHER SHORTWAVE EMBEDDED IN THE FAST FLOW OVER AZ/NM/AND NORTHERN MEXICO APPROACHES THIS EVENING. CURRENTLY...SUBSIDENCE IS OCCURRING IN WAKE OF THIS MORNING/S STORM COMPLEX. THE ATMOSPHERE SHOULD RE-DESTABILIZE THIS AFTERNOON AS STRONG HEATING OCCURS WITH HIGHS WARMING WELL INTO THE 70S TO EVEN LOWER 80S ACROSS THE FAR WESTERN CWA. THUNDERSTORM CHANCES WILL RETURN LATER THIS EVENING INTO EARLY MONDAY MORNING AS THE SHORTWAVE TO THE WEST ARRIVES AND MOVES ACROSS THE AREA. BEST RAIN CHANCES WILL BE ACROSS THE EAST AND CANNOT RULE OUT A STRONG TO SEVERE STORM OR TWO ALONG WITH LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINS AGAIN...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHEAST AREAS. THIS ACTIVITY IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE AS INTENSE AS THIS PAST MORNING/S CONVECTION...BUT SOMETHING TO BE AWARE OF WITH MANY SATURATED AREAS AROUND NORTH TEXAS. HAVE DECIDED NOT TO ISSUE A FLASH FLOOD WATCH WITH CONFIDENCE WAVERING ON STORM COVERAGE IN THE WAKE OF TODAY/S SUBSIDENCE AND RAINFALL AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN MOSTLY BELOW AN INCH. THE SHORTWAVE SHOULD PULL EAST AWAY FROM THE AREA BY MONDAY AFTERNOON WITH LINGERING RAIN CHANCES ACROSS CENTRAL TEXAS AND OUR SE COUNTIES.  A BROAD UPPER TROUGH WILL REMAIN OVER THE WESTERN U.S THROUGH MUCH OF THE WEEK...WITH OCCASIONAL SHORTWAVE DISTURBANCES MOVING READILY ACROSS THE AREA. THE HIGHEST RAIN CHANCES WILL BE ACROSS THE FAR N/NW COUNTIES AND NORTH OF I-20 THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK AS A SURFACE FRONTAL BOUNDARY STALLS NEAR OR NORTH OF THE RED RIVER WITH A THE UPPER RIDGE BEING MORE STOUT ACROSS CENTRAL TEXAS WITH LOWER RAIN CHANCES. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL EVENTUALLY SAG SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE RED RIVER VALLEY INTO NORTH TEXAS BY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WITH MAINLY DIURNAL RAIN CHANCES ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA. AS NOTED BY THE SATURATED SOIL ACROSS THE REGION...FLOODING WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE MAIN CONCERN WITH THE SEVERE THREAT REMAINING MARGINAL EACH DAY WITH SHORTWAVE RIDGING OCCURRING INTO THE END OF THE WEEK AND INTO NEXT WEEKEND. VERY WARM AND MUGGY MID-LATE MAY CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST THROUGH MID WEEK WITH HIGHS IN THE 80S AND LOWS IN THE UPPER 60S/LOWER 70S. SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPERATURES ARE ON TAP FOR LATE WEEK WITH THE WEAK FRONT...BUT CAA WILL NOT BE SIGNIFICANT. THERE IS HOPE THAT AN UPPER RIDGE WILL STRENGTHEN LATE NEXT WEEKEND INTO THE FOLLOWING WEEK WHICH MAY FINALLY HELP THE AREA DRY OUT SOMEWHAT.  05/  
EXPECTING SUBSIDENCE IN THE WAKE OF TODAY`S STORMS TO KEEP THE AREA MOSTLY FREE OF SHRA/TSRA DEVELOPMENT THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. WATER VAPOR SATELLITE LOOP DOES SHOW POSSIBLE DISTURBANCE AND ASSOCIATED SPEED MAX HEADING THIS WAY FROM THE WEST SOUTHWEST...BUT NOT SURE THIS WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO GENERATE ANY SIGNIFICANT SHRA/TSRA COVERAGE. MVFR CEILINGS ARE ALREADY MOVING INLAND AT GLS AND LBX...AND THINK THEY SHOULD CONTINUE SPREADING INLAND DURING THE REST OF THE EVENING/OVERNIGHT HOURS. MAYBE WET GROUND COULD HELP TO BRING SOME TAF SITES IFR LEVEL CEILINGS/ VISIBILITIES...BUT NOT REAL CONFIDENT THAT THIS WILL MATERIALIZE. MVFR CEILINGS COULD LINGER AROUND DURING THE MORNING HOURS TOMORROW...THEN WE SHOULD SEE SCT/BKN DECK AROUND 5000 FEET IN THE AFTERNOON WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME SHRA/TSRA. FOR THE 18/00Z TAFS...CHOSE TO STICK WITH VCSH FOR NOW.  42 
DISCUSSION... BUSY WEATHER AFTERNOON FOR SOUTHEAST TEXAS AS A LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUES TO PUSH ACROSS THE REGION. AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ACTIVITY STRETCHED FROM BRAZORIA COUNTY ALONG THE UPPER TEXAS COAST AND INTO LIBERTY COUNTY AS OF 3 PM CDT... AND GUSTY WINDS /AS WELL AS SOME BRIEF LOW LEVEL STORM ROTATION/ WAS NOTED AS THE REMAINDER OF THE LINE CONTINUED TO PUSH EASTWARD. EXPECT THE LINE TO CONTINUE TO PUSH EAST WITH THE BEST INSTABILITY LOCATED AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM /LAPS SHOWING 2000-3000 J/KG/ OVER CENTRAL LOUISIANA AND EXTRAPOLATION PLACES THIS LINE CLEAR OF THE FORECAST AREA BETWEEN 5 AND 7 PM CDT... ALTHOUGH A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS WILL CERTAINLY BE POSSIBLE. FOR THE REMAINDER OF TONIGHT... A MORE STABILIZED AIRMASS IN THE WAKE OF THIS SYSTEM WILL HELP LOWER RAIN CHANCES ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION /GENERALLY 10-20 POPS/ WITH THE PRESENCE OF A 20 TO 25 KNOT LOW LEVEL JET POSSIBLY BEING ENOUGH TO GENERATE A FEW STREAMER SHOWERS. AN INCREASE IN RAIN CHANCES OVER THE NORTHERN ZONES OCCURS TOWARDS SUNRISE MONDAY AS AN UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE APPROACHES THE REGION FROM THE WEST. OTHERWISE... EXPECT PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES OVERNIGHT WITH LOWS IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S.  AS STORMS APPROACH THE REGION ON MONDAY... NORTHERN ZONES WILL CONTINUE TO NEED TO BE MONITORED FOR POTENTIAL FLOODING CONCERNS WITH FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOWING PWATS REMAINING NEAR 1.6 TO 1.8 INCHES. WITH THE ADDITIONAL FAVORED AREAS FOR CONVECTION ON MONDAY WILL CENTER AROUND RESIDUAL BOUNDARIES FROM TODAY/S ACTIVITY... AIDED BY DAYTIME HEATING AND LIFT FROM THE PASSING SHORTWAVE. A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPROACHES THE REGION LATE MONDAY INTO EARLY TUESDAY AND THIS WILL SERVE AS ANOTHER FOCUSING MECHANISM FOR ADDITIONAL SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT... ALTHOUGH THE DETAILS ARE STILL A LITTLE FUZZY ON HOW FAR SOUTH THIS FEATURE WILL ACTUALLY MAKE IT /WITH CLIMATOLOGY NOT FAVORING THE FRONT TO REACH THE AREA/. BROAD TROUGHING WILL REMAIN OVER THE WESTERN CONUS THROUGH THE WEEK... BUT A BUILDING 500 MB RIDGE WILL ALLOW THE REGION TO FALL UNDER A MORE QUASI-ZONAL FLOW ALOFT /EFFECTIVELY SHIFTING THE TRAJECTORY OF PASSING DISTURBANCES FARTHER NORTH AND HELPING REDUCE RAIN CHANCES MID- WEEK/. ANOTHER LOW APPROACHES THE REGION BY NEXT WEEKEND... WITH RAIN CHANCES INCREASING CORRESPONDINGLY.  HUFFMAN  MARINE...  SOUTHERLY WINDS HAVE DECREASED DUE TO CONVECTION INLAND THAT HAS WEAKENED THE PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS THE AREA. THERE MAY BE SOME OUTFLOW WINDS ON GALVESTON BAY AND JUST OFF THE COAST BUT OVERALL EXPECT WIND AROUND 10 TO 15 KNOTS FROM THE SE TO CONTINUE TONIGHT. SCEC HAS BEEN DROPPED AS A RESULT. LONG FETCH OF SE WINDS STILL SUPPORTS ELEVATED SEAS AROUND 5 FT TONIGHT. OTHERWISE EXPECT WINDS TO REMAIN AROUND 10-15 KTS FOR MUCH OF THE WEEK WITH MAYBE WINDS AROUND 15KTS DURING THE NIGHT. SEAS SHOULD SUBSIDE A FOOT OR TWO OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS BUT REMAIN AROUND MODERATE LEVELS.  39  
TX...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK THROUGH MONDAY MORNING FOR THE FOLLOWING      ZONES: BRAZORIA...CHAMBERS...GALVESTON...MATAGORDA.  GM...NONE. 
VFR TO PREVAIL OUTSIDE OF CONVECTION WHICH IS EXPECTED TO INITIATE MONDAY AFTERNOON.  ALL THREE TERMINALS COULD BE AFFECTED.  
SHORT TERM... STRONG HEIGHT RISES HAVE TAKEN OVER TODAY IN THE WAKE OF A DEPARTING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. ALTHOUGH DRIER AIR HAS SPREAD OVER THE ENTIRE REGION TODAY LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL SLOWLY TRY TO MAKE ITS WAY BACK TO WEST TEXAS. LOW STRATUS AND FOG WILL CREEP UP FROM THE SOUTHEAST TONIGHT BUT MODELS SHOW IT STOPPING SHORT OR NOT AFFECTING MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN ROLLING PLAINS. THE MOISTURE WILL ENCOUNTER TOUGH RESISTANCE OF PRESSURE/HEIGHT RISES. EVEN DURING THE DAY MONDAY WILL BE TOUGH TO GET THE MOISTURE BACK WITH WINDS NOT BACKING UNTIL THE AFTERNOON. THIS MAY PRESENT A PROBLEM FOR AFTERNOON CONVECTIVE CHANCES. AN UPPER TROUGH WILL DIP DOWN INTO THE GREAT BASIN SO SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL CONTINUE AND BEGIN TO BACK TO THE SOUTHWEST BY LATE TOMORROW AFTERNOON. A WEAK LOW LEVEL THETA-E RIDGE DEVELOPING ACROSS THE SOUTHWESTERN SOUTH PLAINS EXTENDING INTO SOUTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO MAY BE THE BEST AREA FOR CONVECTIVE INITIATION DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON.  LONG TERM... THE EXCEPTIONALLY ACTIVE AND WET MONTH OF MAY SHOWS NO SIGNS OF LETTING UP AS A SPLIT FLOW REGIME PROMISES TO DELIVER A SLEW OF TROUGHS ACROSS THE SWRN CONUS. THIS COMBINED WITH NO SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION TO GULF MOISTURE SPELLS ROUTINE CHANCES FOR RAIN AND SEVERE STORMS NEARLY EVERY DAY THROUGH NEXT SATURDAY.  BY MONDAY NIGHT...THE THETA-E RIDGE DISCUSSED IN THE SHORT TERM WILL BEGIN FLOURISHING AS A LLJ ADVECTS RICHER PWATS OVER MUCH OF THE CWA. VERY MOIST LAPSE RATES IN THIS ENVIRONMENT ARE PROGGED TO YIELD TALL CAPE PROFILES WITH EQUILIBRIUM LEVELS ABOVE 200MB. PWATS OF 1-1.5 INCHES SHOULD BREED SOME HEAVY RAINFALL IN THIS STEADY ISENTROPIC ASCENT REGIME. PRECIP SHOULD CONTINUE INTO TUESDAY MORNING BEFORE A DECENT TROUGH ARRIVES TUE EVENING. STRONGER SW FLOW BY MIDDAY WILL SHARPEN THE DRYLINE ACROSS ERN NM AND PROVIDED DESTABILIZATION OCCURS IN ITS ADVANCE THERE SHOULD BE SOME SEVERE STORMS AS REFLECTED IN SPC/S SWO DAY3.  BEHIND TUE NIGHT/S TROUGH...COOL AIR WILL DISLODGE SOUTH AND STALL IN/NEAR OUR AREA ON WEDNESDAY. COLLOCATION OF THIS FRONT AND A DRYLINE NEAR THE NM BORDER COULD PRESENT AN INTERESTING SCENARIO FOR SEVERE STORMS...HOWEVER MINOR SHORT WAVE RIDGING ALOFT COULD KEEP DEEP CONVECTION MORE LIMITED IN COVERAGE THAN MOST MODELS INDICATE. THIS FRONT WILL LIKELY MIGRATE SOUTH OF THE AREA WED NIGHT LEAVING US IN A COOL UPSLOPE FLOW REGIME ON THURSDAY. MAX TEMPS WERE EDGED INTO THE LOWER 60S IN MOST AREAS AS IT APPEARS WIDESPREAD STRATUS WILL DOMINATE.  WARM ADVECTION LOOKS TO RAMP UP CONSIDERABLY THU NIGHT AS THE FRONT ACCELERATES NORTH IN THE WAKE OF UPPER RIDGING AND STRONGER SW FLOW. THIS SETUP DOES FIT THE BILL FOR BOTH ELEVATED SEVERE CONVECTION AND HEAVY RAINFALL THU NIGHT NORTH OF THE WARM FRONT. A RETURN TO DRYLINE CONVECTION APPEARS LIKELY ON FRI AS THE WARM FRONT MIGRATES NORTH...HOWEVER THE MAJORITY OF MODELS ARE RELUCTANT TO LIFT THIS BOUNDARY COMPLETELY OUT OF OUR AREA DUE TO NUMEROUS CONVECTIVE OUTFLOWS IMPEDING THE FRONT/S PROGRESS. A SURFACE PATTERN INVOLVING A NW-SE STATIONARY/WARM FRONT AND A DRYLINE CERTAINLY GRABS OUR ATTENTION FOR TORNADIC STORMS /NOT AT ALL UNLIKE MAY 12 2005/...SO THIS FRONT/S LOCATION WILL PROVE CRITICAL FOR SUCH AN ENHANCED THREAT. LASTLY...THE SEVERE THREAT LOOKS TO PEAK ON SAT AS AN UPPER LOW ROTATES NE FROM THE FOUR CORNERS AND CONVECTS OVER A LARGE EXTENT OF THE DRYLINE - MUCH LIKE YESTERDAY. SURPRISINGLY...ALL MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE WEEKEND...SO CONFIDENCE IN THIS EXTENDED BOUT OF ACTIVE WX IS ABOVE AVERAGE.  
/00Z TAFS/ Expect VFR conditions this evening across West Central Texas. Low level moisture will make a return late tonight as dryline advances back to the west. Stratus will spread north across the area, with MVFR ceilings at KJCT and KSOA terminals by 07Z and the KABI terminal by 12Z. The KABI terminal may see only scattered low clouds, however still have a few hours of MVFR in the TAF. The low clouds will break up by late Monday morning and VFR conditions will prevail during the afternoon.  
SHORT TERM... (Tonight and Monday)  Much quieter weather expected over the next 24 hours than the last 24. Currently, skies are mainly clear across west central Texas with west/southwesterly flow aloft. There is one shortwave is currently moving east into the eastern half of the state, while another shortwave can be seen moving quickly east/northeast through eastern New Mexico and into west Texas. Subsidence on the backside of the first shortwave is resulting in a lack of activity this afternoon, but as the next shortwave interacts with a northwestward moving dryline this evening, we could see isolated thunderstorms develop mainly south and east of a Cross Plains to Ozona line. As the dryline moves northwest, instability will increase, and 0-6km shear is currently greater than 40 knots, so if thunderstorms do develop, they could potentially become strong to marginally severe. However, the potential for severe weather is diminished by the low confidence in thunderstorms developing.  On Monday, showers and thunderstorms may develop again, especially over the higher terrain to our west as another shortwave moves into the area, and interacts with the dryline. Most of the activity should stay west through the afternoon hours, but we may see some of these thunderstorms approach our western counties by late afternoon or early evening. The thunderstorms will be enhanced by diffluent flow aloft, and good instability in the low levels, so severe weather will again be a possibility with large hail and damaging winds being the main hazards. However, most of this activity should remain west of our area, as storms will likely weaken after moving east off the higher terrain.  Expect lows tonight mainly in the 60s with highs tomorrow warming into the mid to upper 80s.  LONG TERM... (Monday night through Sunday)  Southwest flow aloft will continue through the work work into the weekend. There will be a chance of showers and thunderstorms each day. Best chance of rain will be late Monday night into Tuesday, and Wednesday night into Thursday, as upper shortwaves coincide with weak cold fronts moving into the Big Country. GFS SB CAPES are in the 2000 to 3000 J/KG range, so a few severe thunderstorms possible. Some localized flooding also possible, mainly in the Big Country as the weak cold front focuses heavy rainfall. Next weekend, both the EC and GFS bring the southwest upper trough farther east, which would bring in cooler and more unstable air aloft over West Central Texas. This will allow a continuation of showers and thunderstorms and perhaps enhanced severe potential.  
VFR CONDITIONS TO PREVAIL FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS AT ALL TERMINALS. A COLD FRONT WILL BRING A WIND SHIFT TO EACH TERMINAL BETWEEN 08Z AND 13Z MONDAY. WINDS WILL SLOWLY SHIFT BACK TOWARDS THE EAST BY THE END OF THIS TAF ISSUANCE.  
DISCUSSION...  AN ACTIVE PATTERN IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANCES WERE NEEDED TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.  IN THE SHORT TERM A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE AREA DURING THE EARLY MORNING. LITTLE IMPACT IS EXPECTED. WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE NORTHEAST AND INCREASE. SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPERATURES WILL ARRIVE BEHIND THE FRONT RESULTING IN TEMPERATURES TOMORROW BEING A FEW DEGREES COOLER OVER THE NORTHERN COUNTIES. THIS BOUNDARY WILL BECOME DIFFUSE DURING THE DAY AND WINDS WILL VEER AROUND TO SOUTHEASTERLY AT MOST LOCATIONS AS LEE SURFACE TROUGH STRENGTHENS IN RESPONSE TO THE NEXT UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM APPROACHING FROM THE WEST. THIS WILL START THE NORTHWESTWARD MOVEMENT OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE CURRENTLY IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN TEXAS. LARGE SCALE ASCENT AND MOISTURE ADVECTION SHOULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY ACROSS THE AREA. TRIED TO CONVEY SOME TEMPORAL DETAIL ALTHOUGH UNCERTAINTY STILL EXISTS. THE STRONGEST PERIOD OF ISENTROPIC LIFT AND SATURATION THROUGH A DEEP LAYER OCCURS FROM LATE EVENING IN THE SOUTHWEST THROUGH EARLY MORNING IN THE EAST. THEREAFTER UNRESOLVED DETAILS ON THE MESOSCALE WILL BE KEY IN HOW THINGS EVOLVED DURING THE DAY TUESDAY JUST AS WAS THE CASE THIS PAST SATURDAY. NAM IS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH DIURNAL DESTABILIZATION IN THE WAKE OF MORNING CONVECTION AND SHOWS FAVORABLE THERMODYNAMIC PROFILES FOR ADDITIONAL MORE ROBUST CONVECTION PERHAPS OF A SCATTERED NATURE BY AFTERNOON. DEEP LAYER SHEAR AROUND 50 KNOTS AND BACKED LOW LEVEL WINDS WILL BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR SUSTAINED STORMS AND A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM POTENTIAL. THE FLOOD THREAT APPEARS LOW SIMILAR TO THE LAST SEVERAL SYSTEMS. FOR THE 36 HOUR PERIOD WITH THE HIGHEST PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES IT APPEARS THAT RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL GENERALLY RANGE FROM AN INCH TO AN INCH AND A HALF ACROSS THE AREA.  RETAINED LOW PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY ALTHOUGH THIS PERIOD MAY BE DRIER THAN CURRENTLY INDICATED. NAM AND ECMWF ARE MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH SOUTHWARD MOVEMENT OF COLD FRONT AND COOLER/DRIER AIR MASS MOVING INTO THE AREA BEHIND IT COMPARED TO THE WETTER GFS. WINDS BECOME SOUTHEASTERLY AND STRENGTHEN THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY SIGNALING THE APPROACH OF YET ANOTHER SYSTEM. PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES ARE HIGHEST IN THE LONG TERM FROM THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING.  BRB  
Latest models back winds slightly after sunset, increasing PBL moisture on return flow. 18Z NAM buffer soundings still developing a few hours of LIFR cigs at KMAF, and MVFR at KFST. Otherwise, forecast soundings reach widespread convective temps 16-19Z, w/bases 4-9 kft agl. Best chances for convection look to be Texas terminals late in the forecast period.  
DISCUSSION... Convective potential will remain limited today/tonight, however by Mon AM low level moisture return will be ongoing in earnest, per a low level jet with deepening sely flow thru the day Monday. Meanwhile a plume of much steeper mid level LRs will overspread much of CWFA. This along with strong SB heating will result in large CAPE and the risk of severe storms, especially large hail, a brief tornado can`t be ruled out either. Looking closely at surface temps/dwpnts their respective maxima will be nearly co-located INVOF Pecos River Valley. It does make some sense that storms will initiate near/just ne of the Davis Mtns and then strengthen as they move newd into said warm/moist low level airmass. NAM12 is quite aggressive with instability, possibly around/over 3000 J/KG within the TX portion of Pecos River Valley. This with deep layer shear of 40-45kts will make for a most favorable environment for severe storms across the wrn PB by late afternoon and Lea/ern Eddy Co NM/nw PB by early evening. We will ramp up severe wording in our products for Monday. More of the same Tue, but the dryline will be better developed with rich dwpnt air still along and e of dryline, dwpnts low to mid 60s with evidence of a weak boundary in MSLP data. There is some concern that convection in the morning across the nrn PB could limit afternoon convection Tue? By Wed severe wx concerns will still exist with NAM12 indicating that a frontal boundary may be draped nw-se across the S Plains/nrn PB. A theta-e ridge at surface will be INVOF highway 349 and ewd. Attm it is difficult to confidently say where/if tstms will develop as previous days/nights precip will modulate features and timing. For what its worth, Thur frontal boundary would likely be farther s, even near I-10, and with sw flow aloft and with mstr still in place behind front more rain would be possible, including Fri. Indications are that the mid level trof will finally move enough ewd to restrict rain potential to the far e CWFA Sat/Sun. Temperatures stay more or less normal to below normal thru the forecast with some of the days modulated by precip and of course the front mid week.  
TONIGHT WILL BE COOL AGAIN WITH DRY AIR IN PLACE UNDER CLEAR SKIES. WARMER WEATHER STARTS MONDAY...BUT WE WILL ALSO SEE A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY EAST OF THE RIO GRANDE...AS ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE MOVES THROUGH THE REGION AND DRAWS A LITTLE GULF OF MEXICO MOISTURE OUR WAY. DRIER WEATHER RETURNS FOR ALL AREAS STARTING TUESDAY...WITH SOUTHWEST BREEZES EACH AFTERNOON. FRIDAY MAY TURN WINDY...IN RESPONSE TO A THIRD TROUGH ALOFT MOVING THROUGH THE FOUR CORNERS.  
THE WEAK UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE THAT BROUGHT HIGH CLOUDS TO THE AREA OVERNIGHT...IS MOVING OUT OF THE AREA. THIS WILL LEAVE US WITH CLEAR SKIES AND ANOTHER COOL EVENING. ALTHOUGH MORNING LOWS SHOULD END UP AT LEAST A COUPLE DEGREES WARMER THAN LAST NIGHT WITH THE ABSENCE OF ANY COLD AIR ADVECTION. LATEST WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES DEPICTS WEAK RIDGING THAT WILL TEMPORARILY OCCUPY OUR REGION...WITH UNSTABLE AND CHAOTIC FLOW PATTERN OVER MUCH OF THE NORTHEAST PACIFIC. THIS YEAR...THIS HAS SHOWN TO SUPPORT THE GENESIS OF LARGE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS..UNUSUAL THIS FAR SOUTH FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR...OVER THE E PAC. IMAGERY SHOWS ANOTHER LARGE AREA OF CIRCULATION DEVELOPING UPSTREAM OFF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THIS FEATURE HAS A LEAST TWO ASSOCIATED MAJOR SHORTWAVES. STRONG SUB TROPICAL JET STREAM REMAINS EVIDENT OVER OUR REGION...WITH REINFORCEMENT FROM ANOTHER JET STREAK APPROACHING NORTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA. A WEAKER PAC JET SUPPORTS THE CIRCULATION OFF CO CAL...AND IS PAIRING WITH THE ST JET. AS A CONSEQUENCE...EXIT AREA OF DIFFLUENCE ALOFT IS ALREADY BECOMING ESTABLISHED OVER ARIZONA.  GFS...ECMWF AND NAM SOLUTIONS CONTINUE TO FORECAST THE LOW CENTER INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LATER TONIGHT...THEN QUICKLY WEAKENING AND LIFTING FEATURE NORTH-NORTHEAST OVER THE INTER- MOUNTAIN WEST AND CENTRAL ROCKIES EARLY TUESDAY. DURING THIS PROCESS AN ASSOCIATED SHORT WAVE WILL ROTATE UP OVER US LATER MONDAY AND MONDAY EVENING. LARGE AND COMPLEX TROUGH PATTERN REMAINS RELATIVELY UNCHANGED OFF/OVER THE WEST COAST THROUGH THE WEEK...WITH ANOTHER WEAK FEATURE EXPECTED THURSDAY...THEN ANOTHER POSSIBLE NEXT WEEKEND. OUR RELATIVE PROXIMITY IN THIS PATTERN OVERALL...WILL SPELL WARMER WEATHER WITH AFTERNOON BREEZES MOST DAYS.  IMPACTS MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT:  ISOLATED WIND GUSTS TO 50-60 MPH...LARGE HAIL AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN MONDAY AFTERNOON EAST OF THE RIO GRANDE. POSSIBLE SCATTERED MONDAY NIGHT. APPROACH OF THE SHORT WAVE EARLY MONDAY WILL HELP DRAW THE DRYLINE INTO FAR EASTERN PORTIONS OF OUR CWFA MONDAY AFTERNOON AND A LITTLE FURTHER WEST MONDAY NIGHT. SOLUTIONS DEPICTING A BIT MORE OF A NIGHTTIME THREAT...WITH ASSOCIATED CONVECTION FURTHER WEST WITH THE DRYLINE. FCST SOUNDINGS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT HIGH BASED CONVECTION...WITH MOISTURE LEVELS BETWEEN 550 AND 620 MB...SOME DIRECTIONAL SHEAR AND ROUGHLY 30-40 MPH SPEED SHEAR FOR EASTERN OTERO AND HUDSPETH COUNTIES MON/MON NIGHT. NEGATIVE LI`S AND OTHER FAVORABLE THERMODYNAMIC INDICES GRAZE ERN/NE PORTIONS OF CWFA MONDAY AFTN/EVNG. AS MENTIONED IN PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...ALL THIS FAVORS DEVELOPMENT OF AT LEAST ISOLATED STORMS WITH WEAK ROTATION POSSIBLE IN SOME OF THE STRONGER CELLS.  IMPACTS FRIDAY: WINDY - SOUTHWEST WINDS 25-35 MPH POSSIBLE. LAST COUPLE SOLUTIONS WITH GFS AND ECMWF HAVE STRONGEST WINDS FORECAST FOR FRIDAY. AT THIS JUNCTURE...IT APPEARS THAT CONTRIBUTION WILL BE PRIMARILY FROM MIX DOWN OF STRENGTHENING WINDS ALOFT AHEAD OF THE UPPER LOW DUE INTO THE REGION BY LATE IN THE WEEK. DIFFICULTIES LAY IN FORECASTING EXACT PLACEMENT OF ATTENDANT LEE SIDE TROUGH/PRESSURE GRADIENT ORIENTATION BY THAT TIME AND THIS IS REASONABLE THIS FAR OUT. LASTLY CLOUD COVER SERVES AS A BIG FACTOR BUT LOOKING AT THE PATTERN WITH THE 12 SOLUTIONS...AT LEAST SOME HIGH CLOUDS CAN BE INFERRED.  COOLER WEATHER MAY RETURN NEXT WEEKEND...DEPENDING WHETHER WE SEE AN ASSOCIATED PACIFIC FRONT FROM THE TROUGH LATER THIS WEEK.  
AN ACTIVE PATTERN IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANCES WERE NEEDED TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.  IN THE SHORT TERM A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE AREA DURING THE EARLY MORNING. LITTLE IMPACT IS EXPECTED. WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE NORTHEAST AND INCREASE. SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPERATURES WILL ARRIVE BEHIND THE FRONT RESULTING IN TEMPERATURES TOMORROW BEING A FEW DEGREES COOLER OVER THE NORTHERN COUNTIES. THIS BOUNDARY WILL BECOME DIFFUSE DURING THE DAY AND WINDS WILL VEER AROUND TO SOUTHEASTERLY AT MOST LOCATIONS AS LEE SURFACE TROUGH STRENGTHENS IN RESPONSE TO THE NEXT UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM APPROACHING FROM THE WEST. THIS WILL START THE NORTHWESTWARD MOVEMENT OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE CURRENTLY IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN TEXAS. LARGE SCALE ASCENT AND MOISTURE ADVECTION SHOULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY ACROSS THE AREA. TRIED TO CONVEY SOME TEMPORAL DETAIL ALTHOUGH UNCERTAINTY STILL EXISTS. THE STRONGEST PERIOD OF ISENTROPIC LIFT AND SATURATION THROUGH A DEEP LAYER OCCURS FROM LATE EVENING IN THE SOUTHWEST THROUGH EARLY MORNING IN THE EAST. THEREAFTER UNRESOLVED DETAILS ON THE MESOSCALE WILL BE KEY IN HOW THINGS EVOLVED DURING THE DAY TUESDAY JUST AS WAS THE CASE THIS PAST SATURDAY. NAM IS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH DIURNAL DESTABILIZATION IN THE WAKE OF MORNING CONVECTION AND SHOWS FAVORABLE THERMODYNAMIC PROFILES FOR ADDITIONAL MORE ROBUST CONVECTION PERHAPS OF A SCATTERED NATURE BY AFTERNOON. DEEP LAYER SHEAR AROUND 50 KNOTS AND BACKED LOW LEVEL WINDS WILL BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR SUSTAINED STORMS AND A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM POTENTIAL. THE FLOOD THREAT APPEARS LOW SIMILAR TO THE LAST SEVERAL SYSTEMS. FOR THE 36 HOUR PERIOD WITH THE HIGHEST PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES IT APPEARS THAT RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL GENERALLY RANGE FROM AN INCH TO AN INCH AND A HALF ACROSS THE AREA.  RETAINED LOW PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY ALTHOUGH THIS PERIOD MAY BE DRIER THAN CURRENTLY INDICATED. NAM AND ECMWF ARE MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH SOUTHWARD MOVEMENT OF COLD FRONT AND COOLER/DRIER AIR MASS MOVING INTO THE AREA BEHIND IT COMPARED TO THE WETTER GFS. WINDS BECOME SOUTHEASTERLY AND STRENGTHEN THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY SIGNALING THE APPROACH OF YET ANOTHER SYSTEM. PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES ARE HIGHEST IN THE LONG TERM FROM THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING.  BRB  
BUSY WEATHER AFTERNOON FOR SOUTHEAST TEXAS AS A LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUES TO PUSH ACROSS THE REGION. AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ACTIVITY STRETCHED FROM BRAZORIA COUNTY ALONG THE UPPER TEXAS COAST AND INTO LIBERTY COUNTY AS OF 3 PM CDT... AND GUSTY WINDS /AS WELL AS SOME BRIEF LOW LEVEL STORM ROTATION/ WAS NOTED AS THE REMAINDER OF THE LINE CONTINUED TO PUSH EASTWARD. EXPECT THE LINE TO CONTINUE TO PUSH EAST WITH THE BEST INSTABILITY LOCATED AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM /LAPS SHOWING 2000-3000 J/KG/ OVER CENTRAL LOUSIANA AND EXTRAPOLATION PLACES THIS LINE CLEAR OF THE FORECAST AREA BETWEEN 5 AND 7 PM CDT... ALTHOUGH A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS WILL CERTAINLY BE POSSIBLE. FOR THE REMAINDER OF TONIGHT... A MORE STABILIZED AIRMASS IN THE WAKE OF THIS SYSTEM WILL HELP LOWER RAIN CHANCES ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION /GENERALLY 10-20 POPS/ WITH THE PRESENCE OF A 20 TO 25 KNOT LOW LEVEL JET POSSIBLY BEING ENOUGH TO GENERATE A FEW STREAMER SHOWERS. AN INCREASE IN RAIN CHANCES OVER THE NORTHERN ZONES OCCURS TOWARDS SUNRISE MONDAY AS AN UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE APPROACHES THE REGION FROM THE WEST. OTHERWISE... EXPECT PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES OVERNIGHT WITH LOWS IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S.  AS STORMS APPROACH THE REGION ON MONDAY... NORTHERN ZONES WILL CONTINUE TO NEED TO BE MONITORED FOR POTENTIAL FLOODING CONCERNS WITH FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOWING PWATS REMAINING NEAR 1.6 TO 1.8 INCHES. WITH THE ADDITIONAL FAVORED AREAS FOR CONVECTION ON MONDAY WILL CENTER AROUND RESIDUAL BOUNDARIES FROM TODAY/S ACTIVITY... AIDED BY DAYTIME HEATING AND LIFT FROM THE PASSING SHORTWAVE. A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPROACHES THE REGION LATE MONDAY INTO EARLY TUESDAY AND THIS WILL SERVE AS ANOTHER FOCUSING MECHANISM FOR ADDITIONAL SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT... ALTHOUGH THE DETAILS ARE STILL A LITTLE FUZZY ON HOW FAR SOUTH THIS FEATURE WILL ACTUALLY MAKE IT /WITH CLIMATOLOGY NOT FAVORING THE FRONT TO REACH THE AREA/. BROAD TROUGHING WILL REMAIN OVER THE WESTERN CONUS THROUGH THE WEEK... BUT A BUILDING 500 MB RIDGE WILL ALLOW THE REGION TO FALL UNDER A MORE QUASI-ZONAL FLOW ALOFT /EFFECTIVELY SHIFTING THE TRAJECTORY OF PASSING DISTURBANCES FARTHER NORTH AND HELPING REDUCE RAIN CHANCES MID- WEEK/. ANOTHER LOW APPROACHES THE REGION BY NEXT WEEKEND... WITH RAIN CHANCES INCREASING CORRESPONDINGLY.  HUFFMAN  
SOUTHERLY WINDS HAVE DECREASED DUE TO CONVECTION INLAND THAT HAS WEAKENED THE PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS THE AREA. THERE MAY BE SOME OUTFLOW WINDS ON GALVESTON BAY AND JUST OFF THE COAST BUT OVERALL EXPECT WIND AROUND 10 TO 15 KNOTS FROM THE SE TO CONTINUE TONIGHT. SCEC HAS BEEN DROPPED AS A RESULT. LONG FETCH OF SE WINDS STILL SUPPORTS ELEVATED SEAS AROUND 5 FT TONIGHT. OTHERWISE EXPECT WINDS TO REMAIN AROUND 10-15 KTS FOR MUCH OF THE WEEK WITH MAYBE WINDS AROUND 15KTS DURING THE NIGHT. SEAS SHOULD SUBSIDE A FOOT OR TWO OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS BUT REMAIN AROUND MODERATE LEVELS.  39  
SO FAR THIS AFTERNOON CONVECTION HAS BEEN THE MAIN CONCERN WITH STRATIFORM RAIN BEHIND THE LINE OF STORMS NOW MOVING INTO E TX. EXPECT SHRA TO DECLINE THROUGH THE EVENING. MVFR CIGS ARE EXPECTED OVERNIGHT INTO TOMORROW MORNING. WITH COOL OUTFLOW AIR OVER THE AREA...DO NOT EXPECT MUCH RECOVERY AND THINK BOUNDARY LAYER SHOULD REMAIN STABLE OVERNIGHT SO DO NOT EXPECT ANY CONVECTION OVERNIGHT. TOMORROW THERE MAY BE ENOUGH TIME FOR RECOVER ESPECIALLY WITH HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT IN THE REGION. THINK A MENTION OF VCSH IN TAFS WORKS FOR NOW GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY AND DUE TO THE FACT THAT NONE OF THE HI RES MESOSCALE MODELS HAVE PERFORMED WELL TODAY.  39  
TX...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK THROUGH MONDAY MORNING FOR THE FOLLOWING      ZONES: BRAZORIA...CHAMBERS...GALVESTON...MATAGORDA.  GM...SMALL CRAFT SHOULD EXERCISE CAUTION THROUGH MONDAY MORNING FOR      THE FOLLOWING ZONES: GALVESTON BAY...MATAGORDA BAY...WATERS      FROM FREEPORT TO THE MATAGORDA SHIP CHANNEL 20 NM TO 60      NM...WATERS FROM FREEPORT TO THE MATAGORDA SHIP CHANNEL OUT      20 NM...WATERS FROM HIGH ISLAND TO FREEPORT 20 TO 60 NM...      WATERS FROM HIGH ISLAND TO FREEPORT OUT 20 NM.  
NEAR TERM IS CHANCES FOR CONVECTION LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. CONVECTION FROM EARLIER MCS HAS MOVED EAST OF THE AREA. STARTING TO SEE SOME ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY DEVELOP ALONG AND JUST WEST OF I37. HI RES MODELS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN BRINGING ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS NORTHWARD OUT OF DEEP SOUTH TEXAS LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS MOIST UNSTABLE AIRMASS INTERACTS WITH LEFTOVER BOUNDARIES. CONVECTION WOULD MOST LIKELY IMPACT THE BRUSH COUNTRY AND RIO GRANDE PLAINS. SPC MESOANALYSIS INCREASES MLCAPES BETWEEN 3000 AND 3500 J/KG OVER THESE AREAS...SO SOME CONCERN EXISTS THAT A FEW STRONG TO PERHAPS SEVERE STORMS COULD DEVELOP. MAIN HAZARDS WOULD BE LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS IF DEEP CONVECTION MATERIALIZES. IN ADDITION... LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL COULD FALL OVER THESE AREAS BUT CONFIDENCE IS NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO INCLUDE THIS IN THE FORECAST JUST YET. EXPECT A DOWNTREND IN CONVECTION AFTER 06Z AS STORMS MOVE NORTHWARD OUT OF THE AREA. FOR MONDAY...DEEPER MOISTURE AXIS WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE NORTHWEST PART OF THE AREA AND WILL KEEP SOME SLIGHT TO LOW END CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST. CONCERNING TEMPERATURES...HIGHS WILL BE ON THE WARM SIDE TOMORROW WITH LOWER 90S OUT WEST WITH MIDDLE TO UPPER 80S ELSEWHERE.  
OF THE ECMWF WITH RESPECT TO OUR RECENT RAIN EVENTS...DECIDED TO LEAN HEAVILY TWDS ITS SOLN FOR THE EXTENDED FCST. INITIALLY HOWEVER NOT MUCH FORCING AND MARGINAL MOISTURE WL PREVAIL ON TUE AND WED ACROSS THE CWA.  WL CARRY SOME SLIGHT CHC POPS FOR BOTH DAYS ACROSS THE NRN PORTION OF THE CWA. OTHERWISE...MOST AREAS WL REMAIN DRY ON TUE/WED WITH A RETURN TO BREEZY/WINDY CONDITIONS...ESPECIALLY SOUTHERN AREAS.  AS THE NEXT FRONT MOVES SWD ACROSS NORTH AND CENTRAL TX WED NIGHT INTO THU...A POTENTIAL MCS MAY IMPACT THE BRUSH COUNTRY LATE WED NIGHT.  BETTER CHANCES WL LKLY EXIST ON THU AS THE FRONT MAKES ITS CLOSEST APPROACH JUST TO OUR NORTH.  INCREASED MOISTURE CONVERGENCE AND ADVECTION ALONG WITH A WK S/WV SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO WARRANT CHC POPS FOR MOST OF THE CWA ON THU.  SLIGHTLY LOWER POPS ARE EXPECTED ON FRI AND SAT AS THE FRONT MOVES BACK NORTH.  A STRONGER S/WV IS EXPECTED TO IMPACT THE CWA ON SUNDAY AND SO WL RAISE POPS AGAIN.  BEST CHANCES THROUGH MOST OF THE FCST PD WL REMAIN ACROSS THE BRUSH COUNTRY AND NORTHERN COASTAL BEND. TEMPS WL REMAIN NEAR CLIMO FOR TUE AND WED BUT WL DIP BELOW CLIMO ONCE AGAIN FROM THU ONWARD DUE TO INCREASED RAIN CHANCES AND THICKER CLOUD CVR.  
STRONG HEIGHT RISES HAVE TAKEN OVER TODAY IN THE WAKE OF A DEPARTING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. ALTHOUGH DRIER AIR HAS SPREAD OVER THE ENTIRE REGION TODAY LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL SLOWLY TRY TO MAKE ITS WAY BACK TO WEST TEXAS. LOW STRATUS AND FOG WILL CREEP UP FROM THE SOUTHEAST TONIGHT BUT MODELS SHOW IT STOPPING SHORT OR NOT AFFECTING MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN ROLLING PLAINS. THE MOISTURE WILL ENCOUNTER TOUGH RESISTANCE OF PRESSURE/HEIGHT RISES. EVEN DURING THE DAY MONDAY WILL BE TOUGH TO GET THE MOISTURE BACK WITH WINDS NOT BACKING UNTIL THE AFTERNOON. THIS MAY PRESENT A PROBLEM FOR AFTERNOON CONVECTIVE CHANCES. AN UPPER TROUGH WILL DIP DOWN INTO THE GREAT BASIN SO SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL CONTINUE AND BEGIN TO BACK TO THE SOUTHWEST BY LATE TOMORROW AFTERNOON. A WEAK LOW LEVEL THETA-E RIDGE DEVELOPING ACROSS THE SOUTHWESTERN SOUTH PLAINS EXTENDING INTO SOUTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO MAY BE THE BEST AREA FOR CONVECTIVE INITIATION DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON.  
(Tonight and Monday)  Much quieter weather expected over the next 24 hours than the last 24. Currently, skies are mainly clear across west central Texas with west/southwesterly flow aloft. There is one shortwave is currently moving east into the eastern half of the state, while another shortwave can be seen moving quickly east/northeast through eastern New Mexico and into west Texas. Subsidence on the backside of the first shortwave is resulting in a lack of activity this afternoon, but as the next shortwave interacts with a northwestward moving dryline this evening, we could see isolated thunderstorms develop mainly south and east of a Cross Plains to Ozona line. As the dryline moves northwest, instability will increase, and 0-6km shear is currently greater than 40 knots, so if thunderstorms do develop, they could potentially become strong to marginally severe. However, the potential for severe weather is diminished by the low confidence in thunderstorms developing.  On Monday, showers and thunderstorms may develop again, especially over the higher terrain to our west as another shortwave moves into the area, and interacts with the dryline. Most of the activity should stay west through the afternoon hours, but we may see some of these thunderstorms approach our western counties by late afternoon or early evening. The thunderstorms will be enhanced by diffluent flow aloft, and good instability in the low levels, so severe weather will again be a possibility with large hail and damaging winds being the main hazards. However, most of this activity should remain west of our area, as storms will likely weaken after moving east off the higher terrain.  Expect lows tonight mainly in the 60s with highs tomorrow warming into the mid to upper 80s.   
A MCS MODIFIED AIR MASS WILL LIMIT MUCH OF THE CONVECTION FOR TONIGHT...ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE MODEL DATA CONTINUES TO SUPPORT SCATTERED CONVECTION AND SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL AMOUNTS. WILL UNDERCUT POPS TO MAINLY SLIGHT CHANCES...WITH ONLY A SMALL REGION OF SLIGHTLY ENHANCED POPS OVER THE RIO GRANDE PLAINS. A SMALL OUTFLOW BOUNDARY LOCATED IN THIS AREA COULD TAP INTO DAYTIME HEATING THIS EVENING...WITH INCREASING STABILITY EXPECTED TONIGHT. IF A STRONG CELL DOES DEVELOP THIS EVENING...LIGHT WESTERLY STEERING FLOW SHOULD LEAD TO SHORT-LIVED CONVECTION. THE HRRR GENERATES OVERNIGHT CONVECTION OVER CENTRAL COUNTIES FROM THE LLJ ENHANCED RETURN FLOW OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...BUT EXPECT MORE IN THE LINE OF SPRINKLES OR DRIZZLE AFTER MIDNIGHT. RAIN CHANCES SHOULD PICK UP AGAIN MONDAY...BUT BOUNDARY INTERACTIONS SHOULD BE MORE FAVORABLE WELL TO THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST. THUS WILL KEEP LOW END CHANCE POPS WHICH IS STILL DOWN FROM THE SYNOPTIC MODELS THAT ARE ROUGHLY 20 PERCENT HIGHER ON POPS. BY MONDAY NIGHT...CONVERGENCE TO MODEL CONSENSUS IS REASONABLE WITH POPS STILL FAVORED TO THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST BASED ON CONVECTIVE INITIATION MOSTLY FAVORED TO THE NW.  
TUESDAY INTO THURSDAY REMAINS AN INTERESTING PERIOD WITH MOST OF THE SYNOPTIC MODELS SHIFTING IN FAVOR OF A FRONTAL ZONE REACHING CENTRAL TX. WITH THE NEXT MID TO UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH EJECTION...EXPECTED TO MOVE FROM NRN MEXICO INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS...SHOWN TO BE MORE SHALLOW AND FARTHER NW THAN THE PREVIOUS COUPLE OF DISTURBANCES...AM STILL IN FAVOR OF CONSERVATIVE POPS WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS TO THE NORTH. BY THURSDAY...REPEATED ROUNDS OF THUNDERSTORMS OVER NORTH TEXAS SHOULD ENABLE ENOUGH BOUNDARY POOLING TO ENHANCE RAIN CHANCES INTO THE WEEKEND...THOUGH THE BLEND OF MODEL DATA ONLY SHOWS A SUBTLE EASTERLY SHIFT IN WINDS. LATER RUNS SHOULD BE ABLE TO FURTHER CLARIFY WHETHER A FRONT MAKES INTO THE AREA...AND WITH THAT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING IF NEW FLASH FLOOD OR POSSIBLE SEVERE THREATS WERE TO COME ABOUT. TEMPERATURES ARE ALSO AT THE MERCY OF THESE EVER CHANGING BOUNDARY AND THUNDERSTORM INDUCED CLOUD AREAS...SO A BLENDED GUIDANCE APPROACH TO THE FORECAST CONTINUES WITH CONTINUED HUMID AND MILD CONDITIONS.  
/ISSUED 1236 PM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015/ /18Z TAFS/  VFR CONDITIONS PREVAIL NOW ACROSS NORTH TEXAS AS ALL OF THE RAIN AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE MOVED TO THE EAST. THE CLEARING LINE IS JUST TO THE WEST OF THE METROPLEX BUT IT APPEARS THAT WE WILL REMAIN GENERALLY OVERCAST WITH HIGH CLOUDINESS THROUGH THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON. THERE IS A SMALL CHANCE FOR ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING BUT CHANCES APPEAR TOO LOW TO MENTION AT THIS TIME IN THE CURRENT FORECAST. BETTER CHANCES FOR STORM DEVELOPMENT OCCUR LATER TONIGHT BUT MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD BE EAST OF THE MAJOR AIRPORTS. MVFR CIGS WILL LIKELY SPREAD NORTH AGAIN OVERNIGHT AND PERSIST INTO MONDAY MORNING.  DUNN   
EAST CENTRAL TEXAS SHOULD CONTINUE MOVING TOWARD THE EAST...BUT INFLOW OVER THE CWA HAS DEVELOPED INTO WEAK SHOWER ACTIVITY OVER KENEDY COUNTY AND NOW THE MID VALLEY. SLIGHTLY DEEPER CONVECTION...WITH A FEW TSTMS IN THE MIX...WILL BE POSSIBLE THROUGH EARLY EVENING WITH SURFACE DEW POINTS IN THE MID 70S...THOUGH A WEAK CAP AND DRIER AIR ALOFT MAY PUT THE KIBOSH ON ANY MORE SIGNIFICANT WEATHER. MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES WILL PREVAIL TONIGHT...WITH LOW TEMPS REMAINING ABOVE NORMAL IN THE MID 70S.  THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STORM SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE NORTHEAST AND H5 RIDGING WILL BUILD OVER THE HIGH PLAINS IN THE SHORT TERM. HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE SOUTH OUT OF THE CANADIAN PLAINS AND INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ON MONDAY. THE TRAJECTORY WILL TAKE THE AIR MASS SLASH FRONT EAST WHERE THE BOUNDARY WILL MOVE TOWARD THE NORTH GULF COAST...BUT MAY NEVER OR WILL JUST BARELY GET THERE. MONDAY HIGH TEMPS WILL CONTINUE TO TREND ABOVE NORMAL...IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S...WITH ABOVE NORMAL MID 70S FOR LOW TEMPERATURES MONDAY NIGHT. LIGHT TO MODERATE SOUTHEAST WINDS WILL PREVAIL WITH A MIX OF CLOUDS AND SUN.  
NOW THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL INTERACT WITH PERSISTENT LOWER PRESSURE INLAND TO PRODUCE MODERATE TO STRONG SOUTHEAST WINDS AND HIGHER SEAS ALONG THE LOWER TEXAS COAST THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. EXERCISE CAUTION CONDITIONS ON THE GULF MAY BECOME LOW END SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS BY LATE THIS EVE...PERSISTING UNTIL SOMETIME MONDAY MORNING. DUE TO THE BORDER LINE FCST...OPTED TO LET THE NEXT SHIFT TAKE A SECOND LOOK BEFORE MAKING A FINAL DECISION ON ISSUING A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY.  TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...WINDS WILL BEGIN THE PERIOD IN THE 15 TO 20 KNOT RANGE DUE TO GRADIENT BETWEEN EXPANSIVE HIGH ACROSS THE EASTERN US AND LOW PRESSURE ACROSS THE ROCKIES. THIS WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH SEAS ABOVE 5 FEET THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON. STARTING WEDNESDAY THE LOW PRESSURE STARTS TO WEAKEN...WITH SFC RIDGE BECOMING MORE DOMINANT ACROSS THE WESTERN GULF. THIS WILL PULL WINDS DOWN TO 10 TO 15 KNOTS...WITH SEAS LOWERING TO AROUND 3 FEET.  
Convective potential will remain limited today/tonight, however by Mon AM low level moisture return will be ongoing in earnest, per a low level jet with deepening sely flow thru the day Monday. Meanwhile a plume of much steeper mid level LRs will overspread much of CWFA. This along with strong SB heating will result in large CAPE and the risk of severe storms, especially large hail, a brief tornado can`t be ruled out either. Looking closely at surface temps/dwpnts their respective maxima will be nearly co-located INVOF Pecos River Valley. It does make some sense that storms will initiate near/just ne of the Davis Mtns and then strengthen as they move newd into said warm/moist low level airmass. NAM12 is quite aggressive with instability, possibly around/over 3000 J/KG within the TX portion of Pecos River Valley. This with deep layer shear of 40-45kts will make for a most favorable environment for severe storms across the wrn PB by late afternoon and Lea/ern Eddy Co NM/nw PB by early evening. We will ramp up severe wording in our products for Monday. More of the same Tue, but the dryline will be better developed with rich dwpnt air still along and e of dryline, dwpnts low to mid 60s with evidence of a weak boundary in MSLP data. There is some concern that convection in the morning across the nrn PB could limit afternoon convection Tue? By Wed severe wx concerns will still exist with NAM12 indicating that a frontal boundary may be draped nw-se across the S Plains/nrn PB. A theta-e ridge at surface will be INVOF highway 349 and ewd. Attm it is difficult to confidently say where/if tstms will develop as previous days/nights precip will modulate features and timing. For what its worth, Thur frontal boundary would likely be farther s, even near I-10, and with sw flow aloft and with mstr still in place behind front more rain would be possible, including Fri. Indications are that the mid level trof will finally move enough ewd to restrict rain potential to the far e CWFA Sat/Sun. Temperatures stay more or less normal to below normal thru the forecast with some of the days modulated by precip and of course the front mid week.  
BOUNDARIES ARE PRESENT ACROSS SOUTH TEXAS. SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO IMPACT THE VCT TERMINAL AND WILL PREVAIL TSRA FOR A SHORT INTERVAL. ANTICIPATE CONVECTION OVER THE NE WILL PUSH OFF TO THE EAST AND NE. ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...MOST LIKELY TO IMPACT THE ALI AND LRD TERMINALS. MIX OF MVFR/LOW END VFR CONDITIONS THIS AFTERNOON WILL TRANSITION TO MOSTLY MVFR TONIGHT. SOME POSSIBILITY OF IFR CIGS TO DEVELOP...BUT NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO INCLUDE IN THE FORECAST.  
DISCUSSION...EARLIER MCS CONTINUES TO WEAKEN AS EVIDENT WITH CLOUD TOPS WARMING OVER THE NORTHERN AREAS. LAST OF THE ACTIVITY FOR NOW REMAINS OVER THE VICTORIA CROSSROADS WHERE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ARE ONGOING. CONVECTION SHOULD PUSH OFF TO THE EAST AND NORTHEAST INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON. MAIN REASON FOR THE UPDATE WAS FRESHEN UP THE FORECAST BASED ON LATEST TRENDS AND EXPIRE SCA AS WINDS HAVE FALLEN BELOW 20 KNOTS .  ATTENTION WILL THEN WILL TURN TO OUT WEST LATER ON THIS EVENING. LATEST SPC MESOANALYSIS INDICATES INCREASING INSTABILITY BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON WITH MLCAPES AOA 3500 J/KG. OUTFLOW FROM EARLIER CONVECTION MAY FOCUS REDEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. HRRR HAS BEEN HINTING AT THIS FOR THE LAST SEVERAL RUNS WITH CONVECTION MOVING NORTHWARD OUT OF DEEP SOUTH TEXAS. CONDITIONAL RISK OF STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS EXISTS IF CONVECTION DOES INDEED DEVELOP. ALSO...HEAVY RAIN AND LOCALIZED FLOODING WILL BE A CONCERN WITH SOILS SATURATED FROM RECENT RAINS.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 645 AM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015/  DISCUSSION...STORMS HAVE BUILT BACK ALL THE WAY TO EAGLE PASS BUT THE OVERALL PROGRESSION OF THE LINE CONTINUES TO SHOW EAST-SOUTHEAST MOVEMENT. CURRENT 12Z SOUNDING AT CRP SHOWS A DRY LAYER BETWEEN 850-700 MB LAYER. LATEST HRRR AND RAP ALONG WITH 06Z NAM STILL SHOW THAT STORMS SHOULD SHOW WEAKENING TREND AS THEY REACH SOUTH TEXAS AND ENCOUNTER NEGATIVE THETA-E ADVECTION OVER THE COASTAL PLAINS. SEE AVIATION SECTION FOR 12Z TAFS.  AVIATION...LOW LEVEL FLOW OF 30-35 KNOTS HAS LIMITED FOG POTENTIAL OVER INLAND AREAS. MVFR CIGS ARE PREVALENT OVER THE REGION THIS MORNING. MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM MOVING OUT OF THE HILL COUNTRY IS EXPECTED TO WEAKEN AS IT MOVES TOWARD SOUTH TEXAS. BUT STORMS SHOULD PERSIST AND REACH THE NORTHERN COUNTIES BETWEEN 13-15Z. MENTIONED VCTS AT ALI BUT KEPT THE MENTION OF CONVECTION OUT OF CRP TAFS. OUTFLOW BOUNDARY AND DEEPER MOISTURE MAY LEAD TO ANOTHER ROUND OF CONVECTION OVER THE BRUSH COUNTRY THAT COULD AFFECT LRD LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. MVFR CIGS WILL LIFT BY LATE MORNING WITH VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO BE PREVALENT BY 18Z. MVFR CIGS WILL MOVE BACK INTO THE COASTAL PLAINS BY 00Z MONDAY AND BE PREVALENT OVER ALL OF THE REGION BY 06Z.  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 433 AM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015/  SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MONDAY)...ANOTHER MORNING WITH A DILEMMA WITH REGARDS TO AN UPSTREAM MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM. ENVIRONMENT FOR SUSTAINING MCS NOT AS GOOD AS FRIDAY. GOES SOUNDER IMAGE OF PRECIPITABLE WATER SHOWS DRIER AIR OVER THE NORTHWEST GULF OF MEXICO ADVECTING NORTHWARD INTO THE REGION. CORFIDI VECTORS INDICATE THE MCS SHOULD CONTINUE MOVING TO THE SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE NORTHERN BRUSH COUNTRY AND VICTORIA CROSSROADS REGION THIS MORNING. 00Z HI-RES ARW/NMM AND 03Z SREF STRONGLY INDICATED THIS MCS WOULD REACH NORTHERN COUNTIES WHILE THE 00Z NAM/00Z TECH WRF ALONG WITH 08Z HRRR/RAP SHOWED THE SYSTEM WOULD WEAKEN SUBSTANTIALLY AS IT NEARED THE AREA THIS MORNING. MCS STILL LOOKS WELL ORGANIZED AND WILL LEAN TOWARD BETTER RAIN CHANCES MAINLY FOR THE NORTHERN COUNTIES THIS MORNING. MOST OF THE SHORT RANGE MODELS KEPT THE HIGHER LOW LEVEL THETA-E RIDGE AXIS OVER THE BRUSH COUNTRY FOR THIS AFTERNOON. A DECENT UPPER LEVEL JET STREAK WILL BE MOVING ACROSS NORTHERN MEXICO NOSING INTO THE BRUSH COUNTRY THIS AFTERNOON. COULD SEE REDEVELOPMENT OF CONVECTION ALONG LEFT OVER BOUNDARIES THAT WILL LINGER INTO THE EVENING HOURS. HI-RES MODELS INDICATED THERE COULD BE SOME ISOLATED POCKETS OF HEAVY RAIN FORM OVER THE BRUSH COUNTRY LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO THIS EVENING. IF SCENARIO BECOMES A BIT CLEARER LATER TODAY...A FLASH FLOOD WATCH MAY BE NEEDED FOR THE WESTERN COUNTIES. THE LOWER THETA-E AIR MASS OVER THE NORTHWEST GULF OF MEXICO WILL MOVE INLAND INTO THE COASTAL BEND ON MONDAY WITH THE HIGHER MOISTURE REMAINING ALONG THE RIO GRANDE. KEPT CHANCE POPS WEST TO GHOST 10 PERCENT POPS ALONG THE COAST MONDAY.  MARINE...SCA WILL CONTINUE FOR THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. EXPECT AS CONVECTION MOVES CLOSER TO THE REGION...GRADIENT WILL DECREASE WITH WIND SPEEDS FALLING BELOW SCA CRITERIA. WAVE WATCH MODEL INDICATED SWELLS WILL BE INCREASING TODAY TO 5 TO 6 FEET AND CONTINUE INTO MONDAY WITH PERIODS OF 7 TO 8 SECONDS. WITH THE CONTINUED MODERATE TO STRONG ONSHORE FLOW AND NEAR NEW MOON...WENT WITH HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS FOR TODAY THROUGH MONDAY.  LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGING IS PROG TO STRENGTHEN ACROSS THE CWA FOR MID WEEK...THOUGH LATEST RUNS OF THE ECMWF HAVE BACKED OFF A BIT ON NORTHWARD BUILDING OF RIDGE. DRIER AIR AT H85 IS ALSO PROG TO BUILD IN FROM THE WESTERN GULF FOR MID WEEK AND THE COMBINATION OF SAID FEATURES SHOULD RESULT IN VERY LOW PRECIP CHANCES FOR EASTERN AREAS BOTH WED/THU. BEST CONVECTIVE CHANCES FOR WESTERN AREAS MID WEEK WILL BE ALONG THE RIO GRANDE WHERE THE DEEPEST MOISTURE WILL BE LOCATED AND WHERE CONVECTIVE TEMPS HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF BEING REACHED. RIDGING BEGINS TO DAMPEN BY LATE IN THE WEEK AS A STRONG MID/UPPER TROUGH SWINGS INTO THE PLAINS RESULTING IN A RETURN TO A POTENTIAL WET WEATHER PATTERN FOR SOUTH TEXAS BY LATE IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD AS A SURFACE FRONT TRIES TO WORK SOUTH INTO CENTRAL TEXAS. TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE WEEK ARE PROG TO BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE SUMMERLIKE WITH HIGHS IN THE 90S...LOWS IN THE 70S...ALONG WIT HUMID CONDITIONS.  
18Z TAF DISCUSSION IN AVIATION SECTION... FORECAST UPDATE IN PUBLIC SECTION...  
CONVECTION CONTINUES TO DEVELOP AHEAD OF A BROKEN LINE OF STORMS ALONG A KLFK/KCXO/KVCT LINE. STRONGER STORMS EXIST FROM WEST OF KDWH TO KVCT. THESE STORMS ARE MOVING SLOW ESE AND LOOK TO IMPACT HOUST AREA TERMINALS THROUGH ABOUT 20Z. STORMS SHOULD BE WEAKENING AS OUTFLOW FORM THE LINE OUT RUNS ANY UPDRAFTS BUT SO FAR ONLY 25 KT WIND GUSTS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED WITH THE STORMS. RAINFALL RATES OF 1 INCH AN HR HAVE LIMITED VSBY AT TERMINALS TO A COUPLE MILES SO LOOKS LIKE THE POTENTIAL FOR IFR AND TSRA WILL GO UNTIL 20Z. AFTER THAT STORMS SHOULD BE DECREASING AND LIKELY JUST HAVE AREA SHRA. EXPECT A DOWNWARD TREND IN SHOWERS THE REST OF THE EVENING.  CIGS SHOULD GO MVFR ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT. OTHER ISSUES WILL BE THE NEXT ROUNDS OF CONVECTION. MODELS ARE NOT HANDLING CURRENT CONVECTION WELL SO SUSPECT THEY ARE NOT HANDLING WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT/TOMRROW WELL EITHER. NAM SUGGESTS SOME CONVECTION OVERNIGHT AND AGAIN TOMORROW. GFS SUGGESTS MORE IN THE AFTERNOON. WILL MENTION VCSH IN THE AFTERNOON TOMORROW TO HINT AT POSSIBILITY BUT WILL NEED TO MONITOR HI RES MODEL TRENDS TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF CONVECTIVE DETAILS FOR TAFS TONIGHT/TOMORROW.  39  PUBLIC FORECAST UPDATE... GIVEN ONGOING CONVECTIVE TRENDS OF STORMS FROM KCXO TO KVCT...INCREASED THUNDERSTORM CHANCES ACROSS THE AREA. RAINFALL RATES HANGING AROUND 1-1.5 INCHES AN HR AT THE MOST. WITH STORMS MOVING...ALBIET SLOW...MOST AREAS GETTING 1-2 INCHES AS STORMS PASS. OVERALL NOT EXPECTING ANY FLOOD IMPACTS BUT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF A FLOOD ADVISORY IS NEEDED. STORMS ARE MOVING INTO A VERY MOIST AND UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE. PRECIP WATER VALUES AROUND 1.8 INCHES AND SB CAPE AROUND 2000-3000 J/KG. MAY GET AN ISO STRONG STORM IN THIS ENVIORNMENT AS WELL WHICH COULD PUT OUT SOME GUSTY WINDS. ALSO HAVE A DECENT 40 KT LLJ FOR STORMS TO GET MOIST INFLOW FROM AND UPPER LEVEL WINDS ARE FAIRLY WEAK SO THERE SHOULD BE DECENT VENTING FROM THE TOP OF STORMS. COLD CLOUD TOPS ON IR SATELLITE IMAGERY SUPPORT THIS SO AT LEAST THINK THERE IS A THREAT FOR THESE STORMS TO HOLD TOGETHER FOR MOST OF THE AFTERNON REGARDLESS OF THE HRRR/RAP ALL SHOWING STORMS GONE BY 21Z THIS AFTERNOON.  14/39  
UPDATE... THUNDERSTORM LINE THAT MOVED ACROSS PARTS OF NORTH AND CENTRAL TEXAS OVERNIGHT IS NOW DRAPED ROUGHLY OVER THE NORTHWESTERN 1/3 OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING... WITH ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOPING AHEAD OF IT COURTESY SURFACE HEATING AND SOME MODEST CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY SUPPORTED BY MORNING DEW POINTS IN THE 70S. LATEST SHORT TERM GUIDANCE REMAINS DISPLACED IN TIME AND LOCATION REGARDING THE EVOLUTION OF THIS ACTIVITY... AND RELIED PRIMARILY ON TIMING THE PASSAGE OF THE 850 MB TROUGH AXIS /ASSOCIATED WITH A CUT OFF LOW OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS/ AS THIS APPEARS TO BE THE PRIMARY FOCUSING MECHANISM FOR THE ONGOING ACTIVITY.  THINK WE/LL MAY SEE RAIN CARRY OVER INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON HOURS PRIMARILY OVER THE NORTHERN ZONES... BUT CONTINUE TO DIMINISH/MOVE EAST OF THE REGION WITH TIME. HIGHEST RAINFALL TOTALS HAVE BEEN ALONG AND NORTH OF A BRENHAM TO HUNTSVILLE TO CROCKETT LINE THIS MORNING /SOME ISOLATED RADAR ESTIMATED 1 TO 2 INCH TOTALS/ BUT THIS HEAVIEST RAINFALL AXIS IS EXPECTED TO SHIFT SOUTH AND EAST THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING AND THIS WILL HELP LIMIT A LARGER FLOODING THREAT. 1515Z WATER VAPOR IMAGERY DOES SHOW SOME CLOUD TOP COOLING OVER HOUSTON/TRINITY COUNTIES THIS MORNING... INDICATING SOME INTENSIFICATION FOR THE STORMS IN THIS REGION. OTHERWISE... MINOR ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO ONGOING FORECAST BASED ON OBSERVATIONAL TRENDS.  HUFFMAN  PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 448 AM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015/  DISCUSSION... LINE OF SHRA/TSRA IN CNTL TX APPROACHING THE I-35 CORRIDOR IS MOVING ESE AT A PRETTY GOOD CLIP AND APPEARS IT SHOULD HOLD TOGETHER AS IT MOVES INTO WESTERN PARTS OF THE CWA AROUND 7 AM ASSUMING CURRENT MVMT HOLDS. GOOD UPPER DIFFLUENCE NOTED WHICH IS AIDING VENTILATION & SAT IMAGERY HAS MAINTAINED COOL TOPS MOST OF THE NIGHT -- MAYBE SOME SLIGHT RECENT WARMING. KEWX IS SHOWING 1-1.5"/HR RATES WHICH MAJORITY OF THE REGION SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE WITHOUT MANY ISSUES ASSUMING PRECIP KEEPS MOVING, BUT WILL KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THINGS CONSIDERING RECENT RAINS. ALTHOUGH KHGX VWP HAS 25-35KT LLVL JET FEEDING INTO THE REGION...GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY IS DEPICTING RELATIVELY DRIER AIR SITUATED JUST OFFSHORE (PWS ~1.4") SO OVERALL CONFIDENCE REGARDING HOW FAR SE THIS COMPLEX MAKES IT IS FAIRLY LOW. SPC-HRRR HAS DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB OVERNIGHT WITH THIS COMPLEX SO WILL TREND FCST TOWARD ITS SOLN IN THE SHORT TERM. ASSUMING ITS SOLN ENDS UP BEING CLOSE, THE LEADING EDGE OF THE PRECIP SHOULD BE EXITING THE CWA AND OFF TO THE EAST TOWARD LUNCH TIME. REMAINDER OF THE TODAYS WX WILL BE DEPENDENT ON RECOVERY AND DIFFERENTIAL HEATING BUT WOULD EXPECT SOME ISO/SCT LATE AFTN ACTIVITY ACROSS NW.  EXPECT ANOTHER ROUND OF STORMS TO DEVELOP ALONG THE DRYLINE AGAIN LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND AGAIN MOVE INTO AT LEAST N PARTS OF THE REGION OVERNIGHT & POSSIBLY CNTL PARTS BY MORNING. GFS/ECMWF SHOW CONTINUED PRECIPITATION THROUGH THE DAY ON MONDAY ACROSS N PARTS BUT SUSPECT THINGS WILL AGAIN BE DRIVEN ON THE MESOSCALE BY THEN (LINGERING BOUNDARIES/HEATING, ETC).  IT IS DEFINITELY A SITUATION WORTH MONITORING AS 3-4" AMOUNTS WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS UP THERE.  W COAST LOW WILL EJECT INTO THE N PLAINS TUESDAY...JUST TO BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER DROPPING IN ITS PLACE. APPEARS SE TX WILL BE ON NRN PERIPHERY OF MID LEVEL RIDGE STRETCHING FROM MEXICO INTO THE GULF AND ALSO THE WRN PERIPHERY OF LLVL RIDGING TO THE EAST. COMBINATION OF THE 2 MIGHT BEGIN TO LIMIT, BUT BY NO MEANS BRING AN END RAIN CHANCES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK. WOULD GENERALLY ANTICIPATE DIURNALLY DRIVEN SCT SHRA/TSRA EACH DAY ACROSS INLAND SECTIONS. THINGS MIGHT GET INTERESTING AGAIN LATER IN THE WEEK IF A FRONT BACKDOORS ALL THE WAY INTO THE REGION AS ECMWF SUGGESTS. GFS ALSO SHOWING THE BOUNDARY, BUT KEEPS IT IN LA. 47  MARINE... A STRONG LOW-LEVEL JET HELPING TO KEEP WINDS OVER THE COASTAL WATERS ELEVATED THIS MORNING...AND WILL LIKELY REMAIN IN PLACE FOR THE REST OF THE DAY. THESE WINDS APPEAR TO BE PROVIDING THE INFLOW FOR A LINE OF STORMS MOVING INTO THE REGION FROM THE NNW. WILL KEEP THE CAUTION FLAGS IN PLACE FOR THE NEAR/OFFSHORE WATERS TODAY. THE PRESSURE GRAD- IENT IS EXPECTED TO RELAX LATE TONIGHT/EARLY MON AS THE SYSTEM MOVES OFF TO THE SE. GENERALLY MODERATE ONSHORE FLOW TO PREVAIL DURING THE  AVIAITON... KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE LINE OF STRONG TSRAS APPROACHING FROM THE NW THIS MORNING. EXTRAPOLATED TIMING HAS THIS LINE NEAR CLL FROM 12Z- 13Z. WHILE SOME OF THE SHORT-RANGE MODELS ARE INDICATING THAT THE IN- TENTISTY OF THESE STORMS WILL WEAKEN AS THEY MOVE INTO SE TX...NOT A LOT OF CONFIDENCE WITH THAT SCENARIO AT THIS TIME. WILL LIKELY ADD A TEMPO GROUP FOR MOST OF THE NRN SITES WITH THE 12Z PACKAGE. 41   
/18Z TAFS/  VFR CONDITIONS PREVAIL NOW ACROSS NORTH TEXAS AS ALL OF THE RAIN AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE MOVED TO THE EAST. THE CLEARING LINE IS JUST TO THE WEST OF THE METROPLEX BUT IT APPEARS THAT WE WILL REMAIN GENERALLY OVERCAST WITH HIGH CLOUDINESS THROUGH THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON. THERE IS A SMALL CHANCE FOR ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING BUT CHANCES APPEAR TOO LOW TO MENTION AT THIS TIME IN THE CURRENT FORECAST. BETTER CHANCES FOR STORM DEVELOPMENT OCCUR LATER TONIGHT BUT MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD BE EAST OF THE MAJOR AIRPORTS. MVFR CIGS WILL LIKELY SPREAD NORTH AGAIN OVERNIGHT AND PERSIST INTO MONDAY MORNING.  DUNN  
A LINE OF STORMS WITH HEAVIER RAINS HAS EXITED THE CWA TO THE SOUTH AND EAST...THUS THE FLASH FLOOD WATCH FOR THE E/SE COUNTIES HAS BEEN CANCELLED. ISOLATED TO SCATTERED DIURNAL ACTIVITY MAY RE-DEVELOP LATE IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS...THOUGH SUBSIDENCE IN BEHIND THE CURRENT COMPLEX SHOULD KEEP MOST AREAS DRY THIS AFTERNOON. AS SUCH...HAVE LOWERED POPS ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA THIS AFTERNOON.  NORTH TEXAS WILL REMAIN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SW FLOW ALOFT INTO THE EARLY HALF OF THE WORK WEEK. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE DISTURBANCE OVER AZ/NM IS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE LATER THIS EVENING AND MOVE ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH MONDAY MORNING. WE EXPECT MORE SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LATE NIGHT ACROSS THE MAINLY EASTERN HALF OF THE AREA...ESPECIALLY E/NE OF THE IMMEDIATE DFW METROPLEX. THOUGH A LOCALIZED THREAT FOR SEVERE WEATHER AND FLOODING IS POSSIBLE...THE OVERALL THREAT SHOULD BE MARGINAL.  05/  
CURRENT LINE OF CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS AND WE/LL KEEP THE FLASH FLOOD WATCH AS IS DUE TO REGENERATION OF CELLS DOWNSTREAM AND POTENTIAL FOR ECHO TRAINING. THE HI-RES SOLUTIONS INDICATE THE CONVECTION WILL DIMINISH AND MOVE OUT OF NORTH/CENTRAL TEXAS FOR THE AFTERNOON...BUT SOME LAGERS ARE POSSIBLE AND WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS ACROSS MUCH OF CWA AND THE EXISTING FLASH FLOOD WATCH AS IS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON.  AS AN UPPER LOW TRANSLATES THROUGH THE NORTHERN PLAINS THIS EVENING...A TRAILING PIECE OF ENERGY OVER NEW MEXICO AND WEST TEXAS WILL MOVE NORTHEAST ACROSS OKLAHOMA. WITH UNSTABLE MOIST AIR REMAINING OVER THE REGION...THIS ENERGY WILL LIKELY PRODUCE ANOTHER ROUND OF CONVECTION ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT...ESPECIALLY FROM THE METROPLEX NORTHWARD AND EASTWARD...AND OVER THE SOUTHEAST COUNTIES ON MONDAY. CONFIDENCE IN THIS EVENT IS MODERATE BUT IS NOT HIGH ENOUGH FOR US TO EXTEND THE FLASH FLOOD WATCH INTO TONIGHT AT THE MOMENT.  FOR NEXT WEEK...ANOTHER WEST COAST UPPER LOW WILL FORM AND EJECT OUT THROUGH THE CENTRAL ROCKIES ON TUESDAY. THIS WILL BE FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER WEST COAST UPPER LOW FORMATION ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT THAT WILL AGAIN MOVE THROUGH THE CENTRAL ROCKIES BY WEEKS END. THE NET RESULT OF THIS PATTERN WILL BE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT NEXT WEEK...A CONTINUED UNSTABLE AIR MASS FOR THE MOST PART...SEVERAL MORE RIPPLES OF SHORT WAVE ENERGY AND MORE DAILY CONVECTION. A FRONT WILL DRIFT TO THE RED RIVER OR INTO OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES MONDAY NIGHT/TUESDAY MORNING...AND WILL BE THE FOCUS FOR CONVECTION DURING THE DAY. THIS FRONT LIFTS BACK NORTH TUESDAY NIGHT...ONLY TO RETURN WEDNESDAY NIGHT. ONCE AGAIN...THE FRONT WILL BE THE FOCUS FOR CONVECTION WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY AND HAVE UPPED POPS AROUND IT.  ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...MAINLY OVER THE NORTHWEST HALF OF THE CWA.  THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO MAX/MIN TEMPERATURES DURING THIS FORECAST. WE EXPECTED THEM TO REMAIN NEAR SEASONAL WITH AN EXCEPTION ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY MORNING AS SLIGHTLY COOLER AIR INVADES THE NORTHERN THIRD BEHIND A COLD FRONT.  75  
A WARM FRONT MOVES INTO THE TRI-STATE TODAY...FOLLOWED BY A COLD FRONT CROSSING THE REGION TONIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS IN FROM THE WEST THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. A WEAK COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA ON FRIDAY...FOLLOWED BY HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING TO THE SOUTH OF LONG ISLAND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK.  


SURFACE WARM FRONT CONTINUES TO MAKE SLUGGISH PROGRESS TO THE N/E. HAVE DELAYED CLEARING FROM THE W ACCORDINGLY. ALSO HAVE SCALED BACK THUNDER/POPS THIS AFTERNOON TO NW ZONES BASED ON EXPECTED LIMITED INSTABILITY OVER ALL BUT NW 1/3 OF CWA. STILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR 500-1000 J/KG OF CAPE ACROSS THE LOWER HUDSON VALLEY AND WESTERN PORTIONS OF NE NJ. SO CANNOT RULE OUT ISOLATED STRONGER TSTM THERE.  BASED ON ANTICIPATION OF CLOUD COVER LINGERING LONGER THAN EXPECTED...HAVE LOWERED HIGHS 1-2 CATEGORIES AT MOST LOCATIONS.  HAVE CONTINUED SPS FOR PATCHY DENSE FOG OVER COASTAL S CT AND SUFFOLK COUNTY THROUGH 2 PM.  
SHOWERS TAPER OFF EARLY THIS EVENING AS PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH DEPARTS. COLD FRONT THEN FOLLOWS THROUGH TONIGHT...POSSIBLY TOUCHING OFF SOME MORE SCATTERED SHOWERS...BUT NOT EXPECTING MUCH IN THE WAY OF RAINFALL.  HIGH PRES THEN BUILDS INTO THE REGION BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. DRY CONDITIONS ON TAP WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. TEMPS COOL OFF ON WEDNESDAY WITH HIGHS IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S...AND THEN SLIGHTLY WARM UP ON THURSDAY WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOW 70S.  
HIGH PRESSURE KEEPS THURSDAY THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY DRY. SOME GUIDANCE BRUSHES THE COASTAL ZONES WITH RAINFALL THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING...ASSOCIATED WITH WEAK LOW PRESSURE PASSING SE OF THE 40N/70W BENCHMARK. WILL MAINTAIN A DRY FORECAST FOR NOW. A COLD FRONT FOLLOWS FRIDAY AFTERNOON...BUT EXPECTING A DRY PASSAGE AND INCREASING WIND GUSTS WITH IT. HIGHS NEAR NORMAL ON THURSDAY...AND A LITTLE WARMER ON FRIDAY.  THE COLD ADVECTION BEHIND THE FRONT LEADS TO COOLER HIGH TEMPERATURES FOR SATURDAY...BUT ONLY SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMALS AT MOST. A RETURN SW FLOW FROM HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OFFSHORE THEN PUSHES HIGH TEMPS BACK ABOVE NORMALS ON SUNDAY...BUT STILL IN THE 70S FOR THE MOST PART.  A WARM FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE SW SUNDAY NIGHT. MEANWHILE...A COLD FRONT DROPS DOWN FROM THE NORTH. SOME UNCERTAINTY REGARDING HOW FAR SOUTH IT PUSHES AND THE MAGNITUDE OF COLD ADVECTION WITH IT. WITH INCREASING MOISTURE AND LIFT SUPPLIED BY THE TWO FRONTS...HAVE GONE WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY COULD BE PRESENT FOR A THUNDERSTORM AS WELL.  
A WARM FRONT PASSING THRU THE REGION THIS AFTN WILL BE FOLLOWED BY A COLD FRONT THIS EVE. HIGH PRESSURE WILL FOLLOW ON WEDNESDAY.  SOME IMPROVEMENT IN THE 16-20Z TIME PERIOD STILL EXPECTED IN THE WAKE OF THE WARM FRONT. ISOLATED TSTMS POSSIBLE WITH THE APPROACH OF THE COLD FRONT AFT 21Z WEST TO 03Z EAST THIS EVENING.  LGT AND VRB WINDS BLW 6KT BECOME SW AROUND 10 KT WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE WARM FRONT BY 18Z FROM WEST TO EAST. WINDS SHIFT TO THE NW AT 15 TO 25 KT WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE COLD FRONT AFTER SUNSET THIS EVENING.       NY METRO ENHANCED AVIATION WEATHER SUPPORT...

MWS FOR PATCHY DENSE FOG OVER ALL BUT NY HARBOR AND ANZ-355 THROUGH 2 PM.  OTHERWISE...SUB-SCA CONDITIONS ON THE WATERS THROUGH TONIGHT. A COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE WATERS TODAY AND MOVES ACROSS THE WATERS TONIGHT WITH SHOWERS/SCT TSTMS. S WINDS SHIFT TO THE SW LATER TODAY...AND THEN TO THE NW BEHIND THE COLD FRONT TONIGHT. GUSTS TO 20 KT POSSIBLE ON THE OCEAN WATERS ON WEDNESDAY...AND THEN TO 25 KT ON THURSDAY AS THE GRADIENT TIGHTENS. SEAS ON THE OCEAN WILL AVERAGE 2-4 FT...AND 1-2 FT ON THE SOUND/HARBOR/BAYS.  
1/4 INCH OR LESS OF RAIN IS POSSIBLE THROUGH THIS EVENING. LITTLE OR NO HYDROLOGIC IMPACT IS EXPECTED.  THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK LOOKS TO BE DRY WITH HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL.  
CT...NONE. NY...NONE. NJ...NONE. MARINE...NONE.  
SURFACE WARM FRONT IS PROGRESSING E/N SLOWER THAN EXPECTED...SO HAVE EXPANDED DURATION OF FOG AND DRIZZLE AND SLOWED DOWN ARRIVAL OF THUNDER. THERE IS THE POTENTIAL THE WARM FRONT NEVER MAKES IT THROUGH EASTERN ZONES BEFORE THE COLD FRONT DOES THIS EVENING.  WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS ANY PATCHY DENSE FOG THROUGH SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENTS.  GIVEN UNCERTAINTY IN WARM FRONTAL PROGRESSION DID NOT MAKE EXTENSIVE CHANGES IN HIGHS FOR TODAY...STILL GENERALLY UPPER 70S TO AROUND 80 FOR AREAS WEST OF THE HUDSON RIVER...AND GENERALLY IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOW 70S EAST OF THE HUDSON RIVER. COASTAL AREAS WILL BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN THAT.  
MWS FOR PATCHY DENSE FOG THROUGH NOON.  OTHERWISE...SUB-SCA CONDITIONS ON THE WATERS THROUGH TONIGHT. A COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE WATERS TODAY AND MOVES ACROSS THE WATERS TONIGHT WITH SHOWERS/SCT TSTMS. S WINDS SHIFT TO THE SW LATER TODAY...AND THEN TO THE NW BEHIND THE COLD FRONT TONIGHT. GUSTS TO 20 KT POSSIBLE ON THE OCEAN WATERS ON WEDNESDAY...AND THEN TO 25 KT ON THURSDAY AS THE GRADIENT TIGHTENS. SEAS ON THE OCEAN WILL AVERAGE 2-4 FT...AND 1-2 FT ON THE SOUND/HARBOR/BAYS.  
AROUND 1/4 INCH OF RAIN IS POSSIBLE THROUGH THIS EVENING. LITTLE OR NO HYDROLOGIC IMPACT IS EXPECTED.  THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK LOOKS TO BE DRY WITH HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL.  
IN THE WAKE OF A COLD FRONT...COOLER AND NOTICEABLY LESS HUMID AIR WILL ARRIVE ACROSS OUR REGION TODAY. HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS WILL THEN SLOWLY SETTLE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY FOR THE MUCH OF THE REST OF THE WEEK.  
THE SURFACE COLD FRONT THIS LATE MORNING IS ALMOST CLEAR OF THE CWA...THOUGH LAGGING UPPER LEVEL COLD FRONT WILL NOT EXIT THE REGION TILL EARLY AFTERNOON. CANNOT RULE OUT A SHOWER FORMING ON THE LEADING EDGE OF THE COLD POOL ALOFT THIS AFTERNOON OVER FAR EASTERN AREAS...OTHERWISE THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE DRY WITH INCREASING AMOUNTS OF SUNSHINE FROM WEST TO EAST.  THIS COLDER AIR MOVING IN WILL ALSO STEEPEN LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES ENOUGH TO ALLOW SOME GUSTY WINDS FROM A LOW LEVEL JET TO MIX DOWN IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS. PEAK GUSTS OF 20-30 MPH POSSIBLE AS SUNSHINE INCREASES.  LATER THIS AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT MODELS INDICATE THAT WRAP AROUND MOISTURE...THAT CURRENTLY IS SEEN OVER THE CENTRAL GREAT LAKES REGION...WILL BRING BKN/OVC SKIES BACK OVER WESTERN AND NORTH- CENTRAL NEW YORK. UPSTREAM OBS SUPPORT THIS WITH LOW CLOUDS SLOWLY SHIFTING EAST ACROSS MICHIGAN. THIS WILL LEAVE MAINLY CLOUDY SKIES TONIGHT WITH SOME UPSLOPE FLOW EVEN BRINGING A CHANCE OF SOME LIGHT SHOWERS EAST OF LAKE ONTARIO AND ACROSS THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY. TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO DROP OVERNIGHT BOTTOMING OUT IN THE LOW TO MID 40S WITH EVEN SOME UPPER 30S POSSIBLE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER AND TUG HILL. WINDS WILL STILL BE BREEZY WITH CONTINUED COLD ADVECTION.  
AFTER A CHILLY START TO THE MORNING LOOK FOR ABUNDANT SUNSHINE ACROSS WESTERN AND NORTH-CENTRAL NEW YORK AS SURFACE-BASED RIDGING WILL DOMINATE THE REGION. IN SPITE OF THE SUNSHINE IT WILL STILL BE QUITE BRISK FOR LATE MAY AS 850MB TEMPS WILL ONLY BE RUNNING AROUND 0C TO -2C...TRANSLATING TO AFTERNOON HIGHS THAT WILL STRUGGLE TO REACH THE 60 DEGREE MARK ACROSS MOST AREAS. THE CHILLINESS WILL BE FURTHER ACCENTUATED BY BRISK WEST-NORTHWESTERLY FLOW BETWEEN HIGH PRESSURE INTRUDING FROM THE UPPER MIDWEST AND LOW PRESSURE OVER THE CANADIAN MARITIMES.  A WEAKENING...SHEARED-OUT SHORTWAVE WILL PASS OVER THE LOWER GREAT LAKES WEDNESDAY NIGHT BRINGING AN INCREASE IN MID-LEVEL CLOUDINESS BUT WITH LITTLE OTHER IMPACT TO THE REGION. THIS CLOUDINESS COUPLED WITH THE PERSISTENT PRESSURE GRADIENT THAT WILL LIMIT DECOUPLING AND RADIATIONAL COOLING...NEGATING ANY FROST THREAT IN SPITE OF READINGS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO DROP INTO THE UPPER 30S ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN TIER AND NORTH COUNTRY WHILE ELSEWHERE LOWS WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE LOW/MID 40S.  IN FACT...THE FORECAST AREA WILL REMAIN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GRADUALLY AMPLIFYING CYCLONIC UPPER LEVEL FLOW THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT THAT WILL PRODUCE LITTLE IF ANY IMPACTS ASIDE FROM OCCASIONAL PASSING MID/UPPER LEVEL CLOUDS. GUIDANCE ATTEMPTS TO SQUEEZE OUT AN ISOLATED SHOWER OR TWO THURSDAY NIGHT AS A SURFACE TROUGH SETS UP ACROSS THE LOWER GREAT LAKES IN ADVANCE OF A MUCH MORE POTENT UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE...HOWEVER GIVEN THE VERY DRY NORTHWESTERLY FLOW AM DISINCLINED TO MENTION ANY PRECIP IN THE FORECAST. WITH THE COLDER AIR OF MID-WEEK MOVING OFF TO OUR EAST...TEMPERATURES WILL REBOUND SOMEWHAT WITH HIGHS IN THE LOW TO MID 60S THURSDAY AND 40S THURSDAY NIGHT.  A POTENT SHORTWAVE DROPPING OUT OF HUDSON BAY WILL STRENGTHEN THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGHING ACROSS THE REGION AND DRIVE ANOTHER COLD FRONT ACROSS THE LOWER GREAT LAKES ON FRIDAY. THE FRONTAL PASSAGE WILL LARGELY BE A DRY ONE WITH PRECIOUS LITTLE MOISTURE TO WORK WITH. THE ONLY AREA THAT HAS EVEN A SLIM CHANCE TO PICK UP A SHOWER OR TWO WILL BE THE NORTH COUNTRY...LOCATED CLOSER TO THE STRONGEST UPPER LEVEL FORCING OVER THE OTTAWA/ST. LAWRENCE VALLEYS. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS IN BEHIND THE FRONT FRIDAY NIGHT. WITH MUCH LIGHTER WINDS AND A VERY COLD AND DRY AIRMASS MOVING INTO PLACE BEHIND THE FRONT...WIDESPREAD FROST LOOKS LIKELY FRIDAY NIGHT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER AND NORTH COUNTRY.  
HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE THE REGION THIS WEEKEND WITH FAIR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS...APART FROM THE USUAL LAKE BREEZES. TEMPERATURES WILL GRADUALLY REBOUND THROUGH THE WEEKEND AFTER A COLD START TO SATURDAY MORNING WITH 60S ON SATURDAY GIVING WAY TO 70S SUNDAY AS THE HIGH MOVES TO THE EAST COAST...PAVING THE WAY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOUTHERLY RETURN FLOW ACROSS THE REGION. CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE MONDAY AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING WARM FRONT THAT WILL USHER IN A RETURN TO WARMER AND MORE UNSETTLED WEATHER AT LEAST FOR THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT WEEK.  
THE COLD FRONT IS PUSHING ACROSS WNY AT 11Z NEAR KROC AND SHOULD BE THROUGH CNY BY 16Z. SKIES SLOW TO CLEAR BEHIND THE FRONT BUT A DRY SLOT SHOULD PROVIDE VFR THROUGH MUCH OF TODAY. LOW CIGS/VIS PRESENT ACROSS THE SOUTHER TIER HIGHER TERRAIN AND WILL TAKE LONGEST TO CLEAR THIS MORNING.  IN THE WAKE OF A COLD FRONT...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ACROSS WESTERN AND NORTH CENTRAL NEW YORK IN THE DRY SLOT. GUSTY WINDS WILL ALSO DEVELOP DURING THE AFTERNOON AS THE COLDER AIR STEEPENS LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES. GUIDANCE THEN SUGGESTS BRINGING SOME MVFR CIGS LATER THIS AFTERNOON INTO THE OVERNIGHT AS WRAP AROUND MOISTURE SHIFTS OVER THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES UNDER COOL NW FLOW ALOFT.  OUTLOOK... WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...VFR.  
A COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP ACROSS LAKE ONTARIO THIS MORNING WITH AN INCREASE IN WIND SPEED AND WAVE ACTION THIS AFTERNOON AND OVERNIGHT AS COOLER AIR OVERSPREADS THE REGION. SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES ARE IN EFFECT FOR THE LAKE ERIE AND LAKE ONTARIO NEARSHORES COVERING TUESDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN BUILD OVER THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK WITH LOW WIND AND WAVE ACTION.  
NY...NONE. MARINE...SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY UNTIL 11 PM EDT THIS EVENING FOR LEZ040-          041.          SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FROM 11 PM THIS EVENING TO 8 PM          EDT WEDNESDAY FOR LOZ043>045.          SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FROM 11 PM THIS EVENING TO 2 PM EDT          WEDNESDAY FOR LOZ042.  
A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REGION TODAY...WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ANTICIPATED. BEHIND THIS FRONT...COOLER DRIER WEATHER WILL FOLLOW FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WORK WEEK.  
1045 AM UPDATE...CLRG AHD OF THE COLD FNT THIS MRNG AS THE LOW CLDS AND FOG FNLY MIX OUT. FNT NOW JUST ENTERING THE XTRM WRN AND NRN ZONES AND THERE STILL MAY BE A THREAT OF SVR WX IN THE FAR EAST. WILL CONT TO MONITOR. MINOR TEMP AND CLD ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO THE GRIDS. PRVS DISC BLO.  415 AM TUE UPDATE... ISOLD-SCTD SHWRS CONTINUE EARLY THIS MRNG...AS A N-S FRNTL BNDRY AND PLUME OF VERY MOIST AIR CONTINUE TO RESIDE ACRS THE RGN. DUE TO SATURATED LOW-LVL/GROUND CONDS...AREAS OF FOG HAVE ALSO DVLPD.  AS THE DAY WEARS ON...DRIER AIR ALOFT WILL SWEEP EWD ACRS NY/PA...IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN APPROACHING UPR-LVL TROUGH. AS A RESULT...FOG SHOULD DISPERSE BY MID-MRNG...WITH CLDS YIELDING TO BREAKS OF SUNSHINE. ANY SHWR ACTIVITY LTR THIS MRNG SHOULD BE ISOLD IN NATURE.  OUR ATTENTION THEN TURNS TO THE INCOMING SFC COLD FRNT. THIS FRNT EXTENDED FROM JUST W OF BUFFALO...TO NEAR ERIE PA...THEN DOWN THROUGH OH ATTM. IT IS PROGGED TO CROSS OUR WRN ZNS LTR THIS MRNG...BEFORE REACHING THE I-81 CORRIDOR BY EARLY AFTN...THEN OUR FAR ERN/SERN ZNS BY MID TO LATE AFTN. SFC HEATING AND SOME HGT FALLS ALOFT SHOULD DESTABILIZE THE ATMOSPHERE SUFFICIENTLY FOR SCTD CONVECTIVE DVLPMT THIS AFTN ALG/JUST AHD OF THE FRNT...MAINLY FROM THE I-81 CORRIDOR EWD. IN ADDITION TO THE ABV MENTIONED DRIER AIR ALOFT...DEEP-LYRD SHEAR IS ALSO CONSIDERABLY STGR TDY (0-6 KM VALUES OF 30-35 KT) VERSUS ON MON...SO THERE IS AT LEAST A MARGINAL THREAT OF LOCALLY GUSTY WINDS/HAIL IN THE MORE ROBUST STORMS. THE MENTION OF SMALL HAIL/GUSTY WINDS WAS ADDED TO THE GRIDS FOR THIS AFTN...AND WE`VE ALSO CONTINUED TO ADVERTISE THIS POTENTIAL IN THE HWO. BY 22-00Z...THE FRNT SHOULD BE TO OUR E...WITH ANY RESIDUAL CONVECTION EXITING STAGE RIGHT.  IT WILL BE SEASONABLY WARM TDY AHD OF THE COLD FRNT...WITH HIGHS RANGING FROM THE MID 70S-LWR 80S.  
430 AM TUE UPDATE... AS HAS BEEN FCST...IT WILL TURN MUCH COOLER TNT AND WED POST-FROPA. IN FACT...WED WILL FEEL MORE LIKE A BRISK AUTUMN DAY...WITH EARLY DAY TEMPS IN THE 40S...ONLY CLIMBING TO THE MID 50S-MID 60S DURING "PEAK HEATING" IN THE AFTN.  OTHER THAN SOME ISOLD SHWRS LTR TNT INTO EARLY WED OVER THE SRN TUG HILL RGN...IT SHOULD AT LEAST BE RAIN-FREE. WE`LL LIKELY SEE A FAIR AMT OF CLDNS OVER CNY LATE TNT AND WED MRNG...OWING TO WRAP-ARND MOISTURE WITH THE UPR TROUGH...AND UPSLOPE NWLY FLOW. CLDS SHOULD BREAK FOR SOME SUNSHINE IN THE AFTN. AS ALLUDED TO EARLIER...IT WILL BE BREEZY...WITH GUSTS INTO THE 15-25 MPH RANGE AREA-WIDE.  CLEARING SKIES AND DIMINISHING WINDS ARE EXPECTED WED NGT...AS SFC RIDGING BUILDS SEWD FROM S-CNTRL CANADA AND THE NRN LKS RGN. THIS WILL SET THE STAGE FOR A COLD NGT...WITH A RESIDENT CHILLY AMS...AND DECENT RADIATING CONDS DVLPG. ATTM...WE`RE FCSTG LOWS IN THE LWR-MID 30S IN OUR NORMALLY COLDER AREAS. AT LEAST PATCHY FROST IS CERTAINLY PSBL...AND THIS POTENTIAL WAS ADDED TO THE HWO. EARLY GARDENERS SHOULD KEEP ABREAST OF THIS SITN.  
0245 AM UPDATE...WE ONLY MADE A COUPLE MINOR CHANGES TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST ISSUED MONDAY AFTERNOON. THE FIRST WAS TO LOWER HIGH TEMPS A COUPLE DEGREES FOR FRIDAY AS A COLD FRONT PUSHES THROUGH THE AREA AND THE SECOND CHANGE WAS TO REMOVE THE MENTION OF PRECIP FOR SUNDAY.  PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...QUIET PD FOR THE XTNDD. SCNDRY FNT APRCHS THE AREA ON FRI AND MGT GENERATE A FEW SHWRS OVER THE NRN AREAS WITH PEAK HTG. HGTS BLDS AGAIN AS SFC HIPRES BLDS IN FOR THE WEEKEND SO XPCT DRY WEATHER INTO SUNDAY. WITH THE TROFINESS ALOFT IN THE PD...TEMPS WILL BE A BIT COOLER THAN NRML DESPITE THE DAYTIME SUN.  
IFR CONDITIONS FOR KAVP AND BELOW ALTERNATE MIN CONDITIONS FOR KBGM/KELM WILL IMPROVE THROUGH THE MID TO LATTER PART OF THIS MORNING AS THE LOW STRATUS AND FOG STARTS TO MIX OUT. FOR THE REMAINING SITES, EXPECT PERIODS OF MVFR CIGS THIS MORNING WITH OTHERWISE VFR CONDITIONS. FINALLY, AS A COLD FRONT CROSSES THE AREA AROUND MIDDAY INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON THERE MAY BE SOME ADDITIONAL SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY EFFECT KSYR/KRME/KBGM/KAVP. THESE COULD PRODUCE GUSTY WINDS ALONG WITH BRIEF RESTRICTIONS.  WINDS GENERALLY LIGHT AND VARIABLE WILL BECOME SOUTHWEST AROUND MID MORNING AT 10 KNOTS THEN NW BY AFTERNOON AT 10-15 KNOTS WITH GUSTS AROUND 25 KNOTS. THESE WINDS WILL THEN DIMINISH TONIGHT.  
PA...NONE. NY...NONE.  
SHOWERS WILL SLOWLY EXIT THE REGION TO THE EAST THIS MORNING FOLLOWED BY A BRIEF BREAK IN THE PRECIPITATION. LATER THIS AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO FORM OVER THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY AND MOVE EAST THROUGH EARLY EVENING. ANY OF THESE STORMS WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE GUSTY WINDS AND SMALL HAIL.  
AS OF 953 AM EDT TUESDAY...THE POTENTIAL FOR STRONG THUNDERSTORMS IS STILL THE HIGHLIGHT FOR THE NEAR TERM TODAY. STRONG THUNDERSTORMS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP ALONG A NARROW RIBBON OF INSTABILITY THIS AFTERNOON MAINLY BETWEEN NOON AND 6 PM. THE MAIN THREATS CONTINUE TO BE STRONG WIND AND LIGHTNING WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME SMALL HAIL AS WELL. THE RAIN SHOWERS FROM THE PREFRONTAL SHORTWAVE HAVE EXISTED THE FORECAST REGION AND WE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER SCATTERED CLOUD DECK THAT WHICH WILL LIMIT SOME OF THE POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVE WEATHER THIS MORNING. THE CLEAR AIR IS MOVING INTO THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY AS OF THIS UPDATE AND SO I EXPECT WARMING WILL BEGIN SHORTLY WITH SURFACE OBS ALREADY BEGINNING TO SHOW DEW POINTS IN THE LOWER 60S ACROSS NORTHERN NEW YORK. THAT WILL DESTABILIZE THE ATMOSPHERE ENOUGH THAT WHEN THE DEEP LAYER 0-6KM SHEAR OF 30-40KTS MOVES IN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL LIKELY DEVELOP MAINLY FROM THE ADIRONDACKS EAST. THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY WILL BE A SMALL ONE HOWEVER AS TEMPS AND DEWPOINTS UPSTREAM WITH THE FRONT OVER ONTARIO ARE REPORTING MID 50S OVER MID 40S.  PREVIOUS DISCUSSION AS OF 653 AM TUESDAY...THE POTENTIAL FOR STRONG THUNDERSTORMS WILL EXIST LATER THIS AFTERNOON OVER PARTS OF THE NORTH COUNTRY WITH GUSTY WINDS...SMALL HAIL...AND LIGHTNING BEING THE MAIN THREATS. RADAR TRENDS THIS MORNING INDICATE THE PRECIPITATION SHIELD FROM THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY EASTWARD ACROSS MUCH OF VERMONT CONTINUES TO PROGRESS OUT OF THE AREA. SHOWERS WILL BE COMING TO AN END BY MID-MORNING AND HAVE TWEAKED THE GRIDS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SLIGHTLY FASTER TIMING. SOME CLEARING SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN ADVANCE OF A SHARP COLD FRONT MOVING INTO THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. THIS WILL ALLOW THE ATMOSPHERE TO DESTABILIZE SUFFICIENTLY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING FRONT. AT THE SAME TIME...DEEP LAYER SHEAR WILL BE INCREASING OVER THE TOP OF THE INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS AND THAT SHOULD ALLOW FOR SOME OF THE STORMS TO BE COME STRONG FROM THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY EASTWARD. THE MAIN TIME FRAME FOR THESE STORMS WILL BE BETWEEN 300 PM AND 700 PM AND AGAIN...WIND GUSTS IN THE 40 TO 50 MPH RANGE...SMALL HAIL...AND LIGHTNING WILL BE THE MAIN THREATS WITH ANY OF THE STORMS. HAVE TWEAKED THE PRECIPITATION CHANCES AND WEATHER GRIDS FOR THIS AFTERNOON TO INDICATE A SHARPER GRADIENT OF SHOWERS AND STORMS...OTHERWISE REMAINDER OF FORECAST IN REAL GOOD SHAPE AND NO OTHER CHANGES NEEDED AT THIS TIME.  
AS OF 421 AM EDT TUESDAY...THE SHOWERS AND STORMS COME TO AN END BY 800 PM WITH JUST SOME SHOWERS POSSIBLE LATER TONIGHT OVER THE MOUNTAINS AS A WEAK DISTURBANCE MOVES ACROSS THE REGION. WEST TO NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT BECOMES ESTABLISHED OVER THE AREA WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY...WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR DRIER AIR TO RETURN ALONG WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES BOTH DAYS. HIGHS WILL GENERALLY BE IN THE 60S DURING THIS TIME PERIOD.  
AS OF 402 AM EDT TUESDAY...OVERALL IDEA FOR THE EXTENDED FORECAST REMAINS UNCHANGED FROM PREVIOUS FORECASTER THINKING WITH GUIDANCE IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN REGARDS TO THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN FROM THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH NEXT MONDAY NIGHT. WITH GENERAL RIDGING DEVELOPING ACROSS THE WEST, MUCH OF THE GREAT LAKES AND THE NORTHEAST WILL REMAIN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A BROAD UPPER TROUGH WITH SEASONABLY COOL AND MAINLY DRY WEATHER EXPECTED. THE BEST SHOT FOR SHOWERS WILL BE ON FRIDAY WITH SHORTWAVE ENERGY PASSING NORTH OF THE BORDER CARVING OUT THE TROUGH OVER NORTHERN PORTIONS OF NEW ENGLAND. NOT A WHOLE LOT OF MOISTURE TO WORK WITH THOUGH SO BETTING WE SEE JUST A FEW ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS DEVELOP ACROSS THE HIGH TERRAIN.  SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS IN FOR THE WEEKEND FROM THE GREAT LAKES FRIDAY NIGHT, SHIFTING EASTWARD ACROSS THE NORTHEAST TO OFFSHORE BY MONDAY. DRY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THROUGH THIS PERIOD WITH THE ONLY REAL WEATHER CONCERN BEING OVERNIGHT LOWS ON FRIDAY NIGHT WHICH WILL RUN IN THE 30S AREA-WIDE TO LOCALLY 20S IN THE ADIRONDACKS ALLOWING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME PATCHY/AREAS OF FROST. AS THE HIGH BEGINS TO SHIFT OFFSHORE SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY THOUGH, SOUTHERLY RETURN FLOW WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO MODERATE TO NEAR NORMAL SATURDAY AND BACK ABOVE NORMAL FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY.  
THROUGH 12Z WEDNESDAY...ANY LINGERING MVFR TRENDS BACK TO VFR THIS MORNING BEFORE A COLD FRONT BRINGS ANOTHER CHANCE FOR MVFR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AFTER 16Z ACROSS NORTHERN NY AND AFTER 18Z AT VERMONT SITES. ACTIVITY WILL BE BRIEF, ENDING FROM WEST TO EAST FROM 19-22Z WHERE BRIEF IFR VSBY WILL BE POSSIBLE IN AT STORMS HITTING A TERMINAL. OUTSIDE OF THE EASTERN CHAMPLAIN VALLEY WHERE SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE GUSTY AT KBTV, WINDS WILL BE SOUTHERLY AT 5-15KTS THROUGH MID-DAY SHIFTING TO THE SOUTH/SOUTHWEST THIS AFTERNOON WITH GUSTS INCREASING TO 18-25 KTS AT KMSS/KSLK/KBTV. AFTER 00Z, SKIES TREND BACK TO VFR AT FEW- SCT250 AND WINDS ABATE TO 5-10 KTS.  OUTLOOK 12Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...  12Z WEDNESDAY - 00Z THURSDAY...MAINLY VFR WITH GUSTY NORTHWEST WINDS AND ISOLATED SHOWERS.  00Z THURSDAY - 00Z FRIDAY...VFR UNDER HIGH PRESSURE.  00Z FRIDAY - 00Z SATURDAY...MAINLY VFR WITH BRIEF MVFR RAIN SHOWERS POSSIBLE.  00Z SATURDAY - 00Z SUNDAY...VFR UNDER HIGH PRESSURE.  
AS OF 943 AM EDT TUESDAY...A LAKE WIND ADVISORY IS NOW IN EFFECT FOR LAKE CHAMPLAIN. RECENT COLCHESTER REEF AND DIAMOND ISLAND OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT SOUTHERLY WINDS HAVE INCREASED INTO THE 15 TO 25 KT RANGE AND WILL REMAIN SO INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS. WAVES OF 1 TO 3 FEET ARE EXPECTED, HIGHEST IN SOUTH-FACING EXPOSURES.  IN ADDITION BOATERS AND OTHER RECREATIONAL INTERESTS ON LAKE CHAMPLAIN SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON. SOME MAY BECOME STRONG PRODUCING GUSTY WINDS AND SMALL HAIL, AS WELL AS FREQUENT LIGHTNING. A LAKE THUNDERSTORM ADVISORY MAY NEED TO BE ISSUED LATER THIS AFTERNOON IF A MORE IMMEDIATE THUNDERSTORM THREAT EXISTS.  
VT...NONE. NY...NONE.  
AS OF 653 AM EDT TUESDAY...THE POTENTIAL FOR STRONG THUNDERSTORMS WILL EXIST LATER THIS AFTERNOON OVER PARTS OF THE NORTH COUNTRY WITH GUSTY WINDS...SMALL HAIL...AND LIGHTNING BEING THE MAIN THREATS. RADAR TRENDS THIS MORNING INDICATE THE PRECIPITATION SHIELD FROM THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY EASTWARD ACROSS MUCH OF VERMONT CONTINUES TO PROGRESS OUT OF THE AREA. SHOWERS WILL BE COMING TO AN END BY MID-MORNING AND HAVE TWEAKED THE GRIDS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SLIGHTLY FASTER TIMING. SOME CLEARING SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN ADVANCE OF A SHARP COLD FRONT MOVING INTO THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. THIS WILL ALLOW THE ATMOSPHERE TO DESTABILIZE SUFFICIENTLY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING FRONT. AT THE SAME TIME...DEEP LAYER SHEAR WILL BE INCREASING OVER THE TOP OF THE INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS AND THAT SHOULD ALLOW FOR SOME OF THE STORMS TO BE COME STRONG FROM THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY EASTWARD. THE MAIN TIME FRAME FOR THESE STORMS WILL BE BETWEEN 300 PM AND 700 PM AND AGAIN...WIND GUSTS IN THE 40 TO 50 MPH RANGE...SMALL HAIL...AND LIGHTNING WILL BE THE MAIN THREATS WITH ANY OF THE STORMS. HAVE TWEAKED THE PRECIPITATION CHANCES AND WEATHER GRIDS FOR THIS AFTERNOON TO INDICATE A SHARPER GRADIENT OF SHOWERS AND STORMS...OTHERWISE REMAINDER OF FORECAST IN REAL GOOD SHAPE AND NO OTHER CHANGES NEEDED AT THIS TIME.  
A COLD FRONT WILL BRING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON. A MUCH COOLER AIR MASS WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THE COLD FRONT...AND REMAIN OVER THE REGION FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.  
AREA OF RAIN IN THE MID HUDSON VALLEY AND WESTERN NEW ENGLAND WILL EXIT THROUGH THE REST OF THE MORNING. THERE ARE STILL HINTS OF AN OLD DIFFUSE MARINE BOUNDARY OVER EASTERN NY...WHILE THE COLD FRONT IN WESTERN NY APPROACHES. THERE ARE SOME AREAS OF CLEARING TO THE WEST...WITH SOME TEXTURED CONVECTIVE CLOUDS IN WESTERN NY PROXIMATE TO THE COLD FRONT. BASED ON AREA 12Z SOUNDINGS...NOT MUCH INSTABILITY OR MOISTURE ALONG THE COLD FRONT BUT SINCE THERE IS QUITE A LOW LEVEL DEW POINT GRADIENT ALONG THE BOUNDARY AND A TIGHTENING BOUNDARY LAYER THERMAL GRADIENT ALONG THE FRONT...SOME NEW SCATTERED SHOWER AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY SHOULD DEVELOP AND TRACK THROUGH THE FORECAST AREAS THIS AFTERNOON...AND EXIT WESTERN NEW ENGLAND LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY THIS EVENING. SPC HAS OUR AREA IN A MARGINAL RISK FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS BUT TRENDS SUGGEST VERY MARGINAL...AND WILL STILL PUT IN THE TOKEN POSSIBLE GUSTY WINDS AND SMALL HAIL IN ANY THUNDERSTORMS. SO...SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO TEMPERATURES...SKY COVER AND RAIN CHANCES BASED ON CURRENT DATA AND TRENDS.  HIGHS TODAY WILL BE IN THE 70S TO LOWER 80S...WITH SOUTHERLY WINDS AT 5 TO 15 MPH BECOME WESTERLY BY LATE IN THE DAY AND INCREASING IN SPEED.  
ANY LEFT-OVER SHOWERS WILL END EARLY TONIGHT...WITH A GUSTY WEST WIND OCCURRING MOST OF THE NIGHT...BRINGING MUCH COOLER AIR TO THE REGION. LOWS WILL BE IN THE UPPER 30S NORTHWEST...TO LOWER 50S SOUTHEAST. AN UPPER LEVEL TROF COULD PRODUCE SOME SHOWERS OVER THE ADIRONDACKS LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING...AND HAVE FORECAST 20 TO 30 PERCENT POPS IN THAT AREA. BY LATER IN THE DAY...EXPECT ALL AREAS TO BE DRY WITH A GUSTY WEST TO NORTHWEST WIND OF 10 TO 20 MPH...AND GUSTS OF 30 MPH OR MORE. HIGHS WEDNESDAY WILL ONLY BE IN THE 50S TO MID 60S.  MAINLY CLEAR AND CHILLY WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH POSSIBLE FROST IN AREAS OUTSIDE THE HUDSON VALLEY AND NORTHWEST CONNECTICUT. LOWS WILL BE IN THE 30S.  MOSTLY TO PARTLY SUNNY THURSDAY AS THE COOL AIR MASS CONTINUES TO DOMINATE. HIGHS WILL BE 60 TO 70.  
OVERALL TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO INITIALLY BE SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL...MODERATING TO NEAR NORMAL FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY. BELOW NORMAL PRECIPITATION SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH THE LONG TERM PERIOD ENDING MEMORIAL DAY.  THE PERIOD STARTS OUT THURSDAY NIGHT WITH A COLD FRONT APPROACHING FROM THE GREAT LAKES AND SOUTHEAST CANADA. THIS FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH OUR REGION ON FRIDAY WITH VERY LIMITED MOISTURE. ALSO THE BEST UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS ARE FORECAST TO PASS BY TO OUR NORTH...SO WILL ONLY MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS.  AFTER THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH...AN EXPANSIVE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN BUILD IN ON SATURDAY AND TAKE HOLD THROUGH MUCH...IF NOT ALL OF THE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND. SATURDAY WILL START OFF COOL WITH FROST POSSIBLE IN OUTLYING AREAS...BUT RAPID WARMING WILL COMMENCE ONCE THE SUN RISES. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE MAINLY IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S.  MODELS TRENDS HAVE BEEN TO BUILD AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE REGION SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO BECOME ESTABLISHED ALONG THE MID ATLANTIC COAST...WITH A RETURN SOUTHERLY FLOW AROUND THE HIGH BRINGING MILDER AIR NORTHWARD THROUGH THE REST OF THE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND. HIGHS WILL LIKELY REACH INTO THE 70S BOTH SUNDAY AND MONDAY. A WARM FRONT WILL APPROACH LATE MONDAY...BUT LOOKS TO REMAIN FAR ENOUGH WEST TO ALLOW FOR DRY CONDITIONS THROUGH THE DAY.  
PLENTY OF STRATUS CLOUDS WITH WIDESPREAD IFR CONDITIONS THIS MORNING AT 12Z...WHICH WILL GRADUALLY IMPROVE TO MVFR THEN VFR ONCE LOW LEVEL CLOUDS SCOUR OUT. THIS SHOULD OCCUR WITH A SOUTHWEST FLOW IN THE LOW LEVELS.  SHOWERS HAVE ALREADY ENDED AT KGFL/KALB...AND SHOULD MOVE EAST OF KPSF/KPOU BY AROUND 14Z. HOWEVER...A COLD FRONT APPROACHING FROM THE NORTH AND WEST WILL TRIGGER SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS FROM MID AFTERNOON INTO EARLY EVENING DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH SURFACE HEATING DEVELOPS. WILL MENTION VCSH FOR KGFL/KALB FOR EARLIER TIMING OF THE COLD FRONT...AND PROB30 FOR TSRA AT KPOU/KPSF WHICH WILL HAVE SLIGHTLY MORE TIME FOR INSTABILITY TO DEVELOP BEFORE THE COLD FRONT ARRIVES. GUSTY WINDS AND MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE WITHIN ANY TSRA.  WINDS WILL BE SOUTHERLY AROUND 5-12 KT WITH GUSTS NEAR 20 KTS AT KALB...THEN SHIFTING TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST AROUND 7-13 KTS THIS EVENING AFTER THE COLD FRONT PUSHES THROUGH. GUSTS OF 20 KTS LIKELY AT KALB/KPSF FOR A TIME THIS EVENING ONCE THE WEST-NORTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPS.  OUTLOOK...  WEDNESDAY NIGHT: NO OPERATIONAL IMPACT. NO SIG WX. THURSDAY: NO OPERATIONAL IMPACT. NO SIG WX. THURSDAY NIGHT: NO OPERATIONAL IMPACT. NO SIG WX. FRIDAY: LOW OPERATIONAL IMPACT. BREEZY. NO SIG WX. FRIDAY NIGHT TO SUNDAY: NO OPERATIONAL IMPACT. NO SIG WX.  
NOTE...MOST OF OUR REGION HAS OFFICIALLY BEEN DECLARED "GREENED-UP" EXCLUDING THE ADIRONDACKS...NORTHERN TACONICS...SOUTHERN VERMONT AND THE CATSKILLS.  RAINFALL LAST NIGHT AND POSSIBLE RAINFALL TODAY FROM SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT WILL GENERALLY PRODUCE ABOUT A QUARTER TO HALF INCH OF RAINFALL...WITH LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS... ESPECIALLY NORTH AND WEST OF THE CAPITAL DISTRICT. DRY CONDITIONS WILL RETURN FOR THE MID WEEK PERIOD THROUGH THE END THE WEEK.  ANY SHOWERS WILL END EARLY TONIGHT...AND IT BE BREEZY MOST OF THE NIGHT BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY PREVENT A PARTIAL RECOVERY OF THE RH IN MANY AREAS.  WEDNESDAY LOOKS RATHER WINDY WITH RH VALUES DROPPING TO AROUND 30 PERCENT ACROSS MOST AREAS SOUTH OF THE ADIRONDACKS. A NORTHWEST WIND WILL GUST TO AROUND 30 MPH AT TIMES IN MANY LOCATIONS.  AS LONG AS THE TOTAL RAINFALL IS OVER A QUARTER OF AN INCH...WE WE SHOULD BE OKAY ON WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...IF WE DO NOT...WE MAY NEED TO CONSIDER FIRE WEATHER HEADLINES FOR WEDNESDAY.  
NO WIDESPREAD HYDRO PROBLEMS ARE EXPECTED THE NEXT 5 DAYS.  RAINFALL LAST NIGHT AND POSSIBLE RAINFALL TODAY FROM SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL GENERALLY PRODUCE ABOUT A QUARTER TO HALF INCH OF RAINFALL...WITH LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS... ESPECIALLY NORTH AND WEST OF THE CAPITAL DISTRICT. DRY CONDITIONS WILL RETURN FOR THE MID WEEK PERIOD THROUGH THE END THE WEEK.

COLD FRONT IS CROSSING WESTERN NEW YORK THIS MORNING. 11Z OBS SHOWING THE FRONT EXTENDS FROM CENTRAL LAKE ONTARIO TO NEAR KROC EXTENDING SOUTH INTO PA. EAST OF THE FRONT...TEMPERATURES HOLDING IN THE UPPER 60S WITH 50S AND 40S TO THE WEST ACROSS LOWER ONTARIO PROVINCE AND MICHIGAN. SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A GOOD DELINEATION OF THE FRONT ALONG THE HIGHER/COLDER CLOUDS. LOW CLOUDS DO LINGER BEHIND THE FRONT SOUTH OF THE NY THRUWAY. EXPECT THE FRONT TO CONTINUE TO SHIFT EAST THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS WITH SKIES CLEARING WEST TO EAST. SOUTHERN TIER LOW CLOUDS AND FOG ARE BEING OBSERVED ACROSS THE HILL TOPS WITH JUST OVC SKIES IN THE VALLEYS.  THROUGH TODAY...THE FRONT SHOULD BE COMPLETELY EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY NOONTIME. SKIES WILL CLEAR FOR A FEW HOURS BEHIND THE FRONT AS A DRY SLOT WORKS OVER THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES WITH THE SLOWEST TO CLEAR BEING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER. FOR CNY...SOME TEMP RECOVERY IS POSSIBLE AFTER DAYBREAK AHEAD OF THE FRONT. THIS WOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO PEAK IN THE LOW TO MID 70S BEFORE THE FRONT ARRIVES. A COOL AND DRY AIRMASS WILL BRING FALLING TEMPERATURES INTO THE 50S AND DEWPOINTS INTO THE 40S BEHIND THE FRONT. THIS COLDER AIR MOVING IN WILL ALSO STEEPEN LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES ENOUGH TO ALLOW SOME GUSTY WINDS FROM A LOW LEVEL JET TO MIX DOWN IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS. PEAK GUSTS OF 20-30 POSSIBLE.  LATER THIS AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT MODELS INDICATE THAT WRAP AROUND MOISTURE WILL BRING BKN/OVC SKIES BACK OVER WESTERN AND NORTH- CENTRAL NEW YORK. UPSTREAM OBS SUPPORT THIS WITH LOW CLOUDS SLOWLY SHIFTING EAST ACROSS MICHIGAN. THIS WILL LEAVE MAINLY CLOUDY SKIES TONIGHT WITH SOME UPSLOPE FLOW EVEN BRINGING A CHANCE OF SOME LIGHT SHOWERS EAST OF LAKE ONTARIO AND ACROSS THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY. TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO DROP OVERNIGHT BOTTOMING OUT IN THE LOW TO MID 40S WITH EVEN SOME UPPER 30S POSSIBLE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER AND TUG HILL. WINDS WILL STILL BE BREEZY WITH CONTINUED COLD ADVECTION.

AFTER 12Z, CONDITIONS TREND DRIER AND BACK TO VFR FOR THE MORNING BEFORE A COLD FRONT BRINGS ANOTHER CHANCE FOR MVFR SHOWERS AND STORMS AFTER 15Z ACROSS NORTHERN NY AND AFTER 18Z AT VERMONT SITES. ACTIVITY WILL END FROM WEST TO EAST FROM 20Z TUE THRU 00Z WED. OUTSIDE OF THE EASTERN CHAMPLAIN VALLEY WHERE SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE GUSTY AT KBTV OVERNIGHT, WINDS WILL BE SOUTHERLY 5 TO 15 KTS TONIGHT. WIND SHIFTS TO THE SOUTH/SOUTHWEST THIS AFTERNOON GUSTING TO 25 KTS WEST OF KBTV.  OUTLOOK 06Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...  06Z WEDNESDAY - 00Z THURSDAY...MAINLY VFR WITH GUSTY NORTHWEST WINDS AND ISOLATED SHOWERS.  00Z THURSDAY - 00Z FRIDAY...VFR UNDER HIGH PRESSURE.  00Z FRIDAY - 00Z SATURDAY...MAINLY VFR WITH BRIEF MVFR RAIN SHOWERS POSSIBLE.  00Z SATURDAY - 00Z SUNDAY...VFR UNDER HIGH PRESSURE.  
415 AM TUE UPDATE... ISOLD-SCTD SHWRS CONTINUE EARLY THIS MRNG...AS A N-S FRNTL BNDRY AND PLUME OF VERY MOIST AIR CONTINUE TO RESIDE ACRS THE RGN. DUE TO SATURATED LOW-LVL/GROUND CONDS...AREAS OF FOG HAVE ALSO DVLPD.  AS THE DAY WEARS ON...DRIER AIR ALOFT WILL SWEEP EWD ACRS NY/PA...IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN APPROACHING UPR-LVL TROUGH. AS A RESULT...FOG SHOULD DISPERSE BY MID-MRNG...WITH CLDS YIELDING TO BREAKS OF SUNSHINE. ANY SHWR ACTIVITY LTR THIS MRNG SHOULD BE ISOLD IN NATURE.  OUR ATTENTION THEN TURNS TO THE INCOMING SFC COLD FRNT. THIS FRNT EXTENDED FROM JUST W OF BUFFALO...TO NEAR ERIE PA...THEN DOWN THROUGH OH ATTM. IT IS PROGGED TO CROSS OUR WRN ZNS LTR THIS MRNG...BEFORE REACHING THE I-81 CORRIDOR BY EARLY AFTN...THEN OUR FAR ERN/SERN ZNS BY MID TO LATE AFTN. SFC HEATING AND SOME HGT FALLS ALOFT SHOULD DESTABILIZE THE ATMOSPHERE SUFFICIENTLY FOR SCTD CONVECTIVE DVLPMT THIS AFTN ALG/JUST AHD OF THE FRNT...MAINLY FROM THE I-81 CORRIDOR EWD. IN ADDITION TO THE ABV MENTIONED DRIER AIR ALOFT...DEEP-LYRD SHEAR IS ALSO CONSIDERABLY STGR TDY (0-6 KM VALUES OF 30-35 KT) VERSUS ON MON...SO THERE IS AT LEAST A MARGINAL THREAT OF LOCALLY GUSTY WINDS/HAIL IN THE MORE ROBUST STORMS. THE MENTION OF SMALL HAIL/GUSTY WINDS WAS ADDED TO THE GRIDS FOR THIS AFTN...AND WE`VE ALSO CONTINUED TO ADVERTISE THIS POTENTIAL IN THE HWO. BY 22-00Z...THE FRNT SHOULD BE TO OUR E...WITH ANY RESIDUAL CONVECTION EXITING STAGE RIGHT.  IT WILL BE SEASONABLY WARM TDY AHD OF THE COLD FRNT...WITH HIGHS RANGING FROM THE MID 70S-LWR 80S.  
COLD FRONT IS CROSSING WESTERN NEW YORK EARLY THIS MORNING. WINDSHIFT WAS RECORDED AT KBUF AT 08Z. EAST OF THE FRONT...RADARS SHOW RAIN SHOWERS HAVE SHIFTED WELL EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE PRE-DAWN HOURS WITH LINGERING MOISTURE. TEMPERATURES HOLDING IN THE 60S EAST OF THE FRONT WITH 50S AND 40S TO THE WEST ACROSS LOWER ONTARIO PROVINCE AND MICHIGAN. SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A GOOD DELINEATION OF THE FRONT WITH OVC ALONG AND EAST OF THE BOUNDARY AND CLR SKIES TO THE WEST. EXPECT THE FRONT TO CONTINUE TO SHIFT EAST THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS WITH SKIES CLEARING WEST TO EAST. SOUTHERN TIER LOW CLOUDS AND FOG ARE BEING OBSERVED ACROSS THE HILL TOPS WITH JUST OVC SKIES IN THE VALLEYS.  THROUGH TODAY...THE FRONT SHOULD BE COMPLETELY EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY NOONTIME. SKIES WILL CLEAR FOR A FEW HOURS BEHIND THE FRONT AS A DRY SLOT WORKS OVER THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES WITH THE SLOWEST TO CLEAR BEING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER. FOR CNY...SOME TEMP RECOVERY IS POSSIBLE AFTER DAYBREAK AHEAD OF THE FRONT. THIS WOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO PEAK IN THE LOW TO MID 70S BEFORE THE FRONT ARRIVES. A COOL AND DRY AIRMASS WILL BRING FALLING TEMPERATURES INTO THE 50S AND DEWPOINTS INTO THE 40S BEHIND THE FRONT. THIS COLDER AIR MOVING IN WILL ALSO STEEPEN LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES ENOUGH TO ALLOW SOME GUSTY WINDS FROM A LOW LEVEL JET TO MIX DOWN IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS. PEAK GUSTS OF 20-30 POSSIBLE.  LATER THIS AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT MODELS INDICATE THAT WRAP AROUND MOISTURE WILL BRING BKN/OVC SKIES BACK OVER WESTERN AND NORTH- CENTRAL NEW YORK. UPSTREAM OBS SUPPORT THIS WITH LOW CLOUDS SLOWLY SHIFTING EAST ACROSS MICHIGAN. THIS WILL LEAVE MAINLY CLOUDY SKIES TONIGHT WITH SOME UPSLOPE FLOW EVEN BRINGING A CHANCE OF SOME LIGHT SHOWERS EAST OF LAKE ONTARIO AND ACROSS THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY. TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO DROP OVERNIGHT BOTTOMING OUT IN THE LOW TO MID 40S WITH EVEN SOME UPPER 30S POSSIBLE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER AND TUG HILL. WINDS WILL STILL BE BREEZY WITH CONTINUED COLD ADVECTION.  
THE COLD FRONT IS PUSHING ACROSS WNY AT 08Z AND SHOULD BE THROUGH CNY BY 16Z. SKIES WILL CLEAR BEHIND THE FRONT WITH A DRY SLOT WORKING IN. LOW CIGS/VIS PRESENT ACROSS THE SOUTHER TIER HIGHER TERRAIN AND WILL TAKE LONGEST TO CLEAR THIS MORNING.  IN THE WAKE OF A COLD FRONT...VFR CONDITIONS WILL BE FOUND ACROSS WESTERN AND NORTH CENTRAL NEW YORK IN THE DRY SLOT. GUSTY WINDS WILL ALSO DEVELOP DURING THE AFTERNOON AS THE COLDER AIR STEEPENS LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES. GUIDANCE THEN SUGGESTS BRINGING SOME MVFR CIGS LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS WRAP AROUND MOISTURE SHIFTS OVER THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES UNDER COOL NW FLOW ALOFT.  OUTLOOK... WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...VFR.  
AS OF 445 AM...THE BAND OF SHOWERS CONTINUES TO MOVE EAST ACROSS THE REGION. THE BACK EDGE WAS FROM NEAR LAKE GEORGE...TO SCHOHARIE COUNTY AND THEN TO CENTRAL DELAWARE COUNTY AND NORTHEAST PENNSYLVANIA. THE BAND HAS WEAKENED AND THE SHOWERS ALONG IT ARE NOT CONINUOUS...BUT LIKELY POPS ARE STILL WARRANTED ALONG AND AHEAD OF THIS LINE UNTIL IT CLEARS THE ENTIRE REGION SOMETIME BETWEEN 8 AND 10 AM. AFTER THAT...DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH SUNSHINE WE GET AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT THAT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING...SBCAPES COULD RISE TO ABOVE 1000 J/KG WITH SCT SHOWERS AND TSTMS REDEVELOPING LATER TODAY...AND SOME TSTMS COULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY GUSTY WINDS AND HAIL.  HIGHS TODAY WILL BE IN THE 70S TO LOWER 80S...WITH SOUTHERLY WINDS AT 5 TO 15 MPH BECOME WESTERLY BY LATE IN THE DAY AND INCREASING IN SPEED.  
COLD FRONT IS CROSSING WESTERN NEW YORK EARLY THIS MORNING. WINDSHIFT WAS RECORDED AT KBUF AT 08Z.

WINDS WILL STILL BE BREEZY WITH CONTINUED COLD ADVECTION.  
IN THE WAKE OF A COLD FRONT...COOLER AND NOTICEABLY LESS HUMID AIR WILL POUR ACROSS OUR REGION ON TUESDAY. HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS WILL THEN SLOWLY SETTLE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY FOR THE MUCH OF THE REST OF THE WEEK.  
RADARS SHOWING A LINE OF SHOWERS ASSOCIATED WITH EARLIER CONVECTION IS PUSHING EAST TO THE CAPITOL REGION EARLY THIS MORNING. A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS AND CLOUDY SKIES MAY LINGER FOR ANOTHER FEW HOURS ACROSS THE EASTERN LAKE ONTARIO REGION. SOME PATCHY FOG IS ALSO POSSIBLE WHEN SKIES CLEAR ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHICH PICKED UP SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL EARLIER. THE COLD FRONT IS FOUND BETWEEN DETROIT AND BUFFALO AT 2AM.  THE COLD FRONT WILL PUSH EAST ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING. IN THE WAKE OF THIS FRONT...H85 TEMPS WILL DROP FROM THE DOUBLE DIGITS TO BETWEEN 2 AND 4C BY LATE AFTERNOON. THUS TEMPERATURES ACROSS WESTERN NY WILL RECOVER INTO THE LOW-MID 60S THIS MORNING... BEFORE DROPPING OFF THROUGH THE 50S BY LATE AFTERNOON. FARTHER EAST ACROSS THE FINGER LAKES REGION...TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECOVER A LITTLE LONGER BEFORE THE COOLER AIR ARRIVES... AND THUS SOME LOW 70S ARE LIKELY THERE BEFORE COOLING THROUGH THE LATE AFTERNOON. OVERALL...TODAY SHOULD BE DRY AND TURNING SUNNY FOR MOST AREAS. WINDS WILL ALSO BECOME GUSTY THIS AFTERNOON BEHIND THE FRONT AS COLDER AIR OVERSPREADS THE REGION ALOFT INCREASING LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES. GUSTS OF 20-30 POSSIBLE.  
THE BULK OF SHRA HAVE PUSHED EAST INTO E. NY EARLY THIS MORNING. THE COLD FRONT WHICH IS JUST WEST OF BUFFALO AT 06Z WILL SHIFT EAST THIS MORNING. SOME LINGERING SHOWERS AND CLOUDS ARE POSSIBLE AHEAD OF THE FRONT WITH IFR FOG AND LOW CIGS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER.  IN THE WAKE OF A COLD FRONT TODAY...VFR CONDITIONS WILL BE FOUND ACROSS WESTERN AND NORTH CENTRAL NEW YORK. GUIDANCE THEN HINTS AT BRINGING SOME MVFR CIGS SOUTH OF LAKE ONTARIO LATER THIS EVENING AS TEMPERATURES COOL ALOFT UNDER NW FLOW.  OUTLOOK... WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...VFR.  
EXPECT CONTINUING RESTRICTIONS OVERNIGHT. FOR KBGM/KAVP, IFR CIGS WILL PERSIST WITH KBGM BELOW ALTERNATE MINS. FOR KITH/KELM/KSYR EXPECT A REDUCTION IN VISBYS NEAR SUNRISE AS CLEARING STARTS TO MAKE IT IN AND ALLOW FOR AREAS OF FOG TO DEVELOP. EXPECT LOW CLOUDS AND FOG TO MIX OUT BY LATER TUESDAY MORNING INTO THE AFTERNOON WITH VFR EXPECTED BY MID AFTERNOON. HOWEVER AS THE COLD FRONT CROSSES THE AREA AROUND MIDDAY INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON THERE MAY BE SOME ADDITIONAL SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY EFFECT KSYR/KRME/KBGM/KAVP. THESE COULD PRODUCE GUSTY WINDS.  S/SE WINDS OVERNIGHT AROUND 5-10 KNOTS BECOMING SOUTHWEST AROUND MID MORNING AT 10 KNOTS THEN NW BY AFTERNOON AT 10-15 KNOTS WITH GUSTS AROUND 25 KNOTS.  
FOG SLOW TO DEVELOP THIS MORNING...BUT VSBYS ARE STARTING TO DROP TO 1-2 MILES ACROSS PORTIONS OF SE CT AND NEAR THE HUDSON RIVER. WILL CARRY PATCHY FOG FOR THE LAND AREAS THROUGH THIS MORNING.  WEAK TROUGH LIES OVER EASTERN PA/WESTERN NJ AND WILL MOVE ACROSS THE LOCAL AREA THIS MORNING. MEANWHILE...A COLD FRONT MOVING INTO WESTERN PA/NY WILL SLOWLY TRACK TO THE EAST DURING THE DAY TODAY...MAKING TO WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA LATE IN THE PERIOD.  SOUTHERLY FLOW AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT WILL USHER A WARMER AND MORE UNSTABLE AIRMASS INTO THE REGION TODAY WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 70S TO AROUND 80 FOR AREAS WEST OF THE HUDSON RIVER...AND GENERALLY IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOW 70S EAST OF THE HUDSON RIVER. COASTAL AREAS WILL BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN THAT.  LINE OF SHOWERS BREAKING UP AS THEY APPROACH WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA...WITH THE BULK OF THE ACTIVITY EITHER TRACKING TO THE NORTH OF ORANGE/PUTNAM COUNTIES OR SOUTH TOWARDS THE DELMARVA. ADDITIONAL SHOWERS BEHIND THAT INITIAL LINE OVER EASTERN PA CONTINUES TO TRACK TO THE EAST...AND SHOWER ACTIVITY SHOULD PICK UP LATER THIS MORNING AS THAT PRE-FRONTAL MOVES THROUGH THE REGION. WITH LITTLE SFC INSTABILITY AND NOT MUCH UPPER LEVEL INSTABILITY...WILL ONLY MENTION SCT THUNDERSTORMS.  
A WARM FRONT EXTENDING SOUTH ACROSS CENTRAL NY AND PA WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA THIS MORNING FOLLOWED BY A COLD FRONT AFTER SUNSET. HIGH PRESSURE WILL FOLLOW ON WEDNESDAY.  IFR AND LIFR CIGS AND VSBYS WITH SCT SHOWERS ARE FORECAST TO IMPROVE AND END WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE WARM FRONT BY 15Z-17Z FROM W TO E.  CAN NOT RULE OUT ISOLATED TSTMS WITH THE APPROACH OF THE WARM FRONT UNTIL 15Z AND AGAIN WITH THE APPROACH OF THE COLD FRONT 19Z-02Z THIS EVENING.  SE WINDS LESS THAN 10 KT BECOME SW AROUND 10 KT WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE WARM FRONT AFT SUNRISE FROM W TO E. WINDS SHIFT FROM THE NW AT 15 TO 25 KT WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE COLD FRONT AFTER SUNSET THIS EVENING.  
HARD TO TELL HOW LOW THE VSBYS ARE ON THE WATERS DUE TO LACK OF OBSERVATIONS AND LOW STRATUS OBSCURING ANY FOG ON THE WATERS...BUT WITH ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...FEEL IT IS PRUDENT TO EXTEND THE DENSE FOG ADVISORY ON THE WATERS RATHER THAN CANCEL IT...SO WILL EXTEND THE DENSE FOG ADVISORY UNTIL 10 AM. ONCE THE SUN RISES AND WE CAN GET A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT IS GOING ON...WILL REEVALUATE.  OTHERWISE...SUB-SCA CONDS ON THE WATERS THROUGH TONIGHT. A COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE WATERS TODAY AND MOVES ACROSS THE WATERS TONIGHT WITH SHOWERS/SCT TSTMS. S WINDS SHIFT TO THE SW LATER TODAY...AND THEN TO THE NW BEHIND THE COLD FRONT TONIGHT. GUSTS TO 20 KT POSSIBLE ON THE OCEAN WATERS ON WEDNESDAY...AND THEN TO 25 KT ON THURSDAY AS THE GRADIENT TIGHTENS. SEAS ON THE OCEAN WILL AVERAGE 2-4 FT...AND 1-2 FT ON THE SOUND/HARBOR/BAYS.  
430 AM TUE UPDATE... AS HAS BEEN FCST...IT WILL TURN MUCH COOLER TNT AND WED POST-FROPA. IN FACT...WED WILL FEEL MORE LIKE A BRISK AUTUMN DAY...WITH EARLY DAY TEMPS IN THE 40S...ONLY CLIMBING TO THE MID 50S-MID 60S DURING "PEAK HEATING" IN THE AFTN.  OTHER THAN SOME ISOLD SHWRS LTR TNT INTO EARLY WED OVER THE SRN TUG HILL RGN...IT SHOULD AT LEAST BE RAIN-FREE. WE`LL LIKELY SEE A FAIR AMT OF CLDNS OVER CNY LATE TNT AND WED MRNG...OWING TO WRAP-ARND MOISTURE WITH THE UPR TROUGH...AND UPSLOPE NWLY FLOW. CLDS SHOULD BREAK FOR SOME SUNSHINE IN THE AFTN. AS ALLUDED TO EARLIER...IT WILL BE BREEZY...WITH GUSTS INTO THE 15-25 MPH RANGE AREA-WIDE.  CLEARING SKIES AND DIMINISHING WINDS ARE EXPECTED WED NGT...AS SFC RIDGING BUILDS SEWD FROM THE S-CNTRL CANADA AND THE NRN LKS RGN. THIS WILL SET THE STAGE FOR A COLD NGT...WITH A RESIDENT CHILLY AMS...AND DECENT RADIATING CONDS DVLPG. ATTM...WE`RE FCSTG LOWS IN THE LWR-MID 30S IN OUR NORMALLY COLDER AREAS. AT LEAST PATCHY FROST IS CERTAINLY PSBL...AND THIS POTENTIAL WAS ADDED TO THE HWO. EARLY GARDENERS SHOULD KEEP ABREAST OF THIS SITN.  
AS OF 421 AM EDT TUESDAY...THE POTENTIAL FOR STRONG THUNDERSTORMS WILL EXIST LATER THIS AFTERNOON OVER PARTS OF THE NORTH COUNTRY WITH GUSTY WINDS...SMALL HAIL...AND LIGHTNING BEING THE MAIN THREATS. WE START WITH FAIRLY WIDESPREAD SHOWERS FROM THE NORTHERN ADIRONDACKS EASTWARD ACROSS VERMONT WITH ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY. THE MAJORITY OF THESE SHOWERS WILL EXIT THE AREA LATER THIS MORNING. SOME CLEARING SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN ADVANCE OF A SHARP COLD FRONT MOVING INTO THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. THIS WILL ALLOW THE ATMOSPHERE TO DESTABILIZE SUFFICIENTLY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING FRONT. AT THE SAME TIME...DEEP LAYER SHEAR WILL BE INCREASING OVER THE TOP OF THE INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS AND THAT SHOULD ALLOW FOR SOME OF THE STORMS TO BE COME STRONG FROM THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY EASTWARD. THE MAIN TIME FRAME FOR THESE STORMS WILL BE BETWEEN 300 PM AND 700 PM AND AGAIN...WIND GUSTS IN THE 40 TO 50 MPH RANGE...SMALL HAIL...AND LIGHTNING WILL BE THE MAIN THREATS WITH ANY OF THE STORMS.  
SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT HOURS AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TUESDAY WITH COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE. FROM TUESDAY NIGHT ONWARD THE WEATHER WILL BE FAIRLY QUIET AND COOL.  
AS OF 129 AM EDT TUESDAY...SLOW MOVING AREA OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED STORMS IS MOVING EAST-NORTHEAST ACROSS CENTRAL AND NORTHERN NEW YORK. THIS ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE MOVING EAST- NORTHEAST OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS. BEST THUNDER THREAT WILL BE OVER SOUTH CENTRAL VERMONT...BUT AREAL COVERAGE OF THE SHOWERS SHOULD BE FAIRLY WIDESPREAD FROM THE NORTHERN ADIRONDACKS EASTWARD ACROSS VERMONT. AS A RESULT...HAVE INCREASED PRECIPITATION CHANCES INTO THE LIKELY/CATEGORICAL RANGES FOR THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. REST OF FORECAST IN REAL GOOD SHAPE AND NO OTHER CHANGES NEEDED.  
AS OF 348 PM EDT MONDAY...ON TUESDAY A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH WEST TO EAST ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA. AS SURFACE HEATS UP AND SOME CAPE DEVELOPS WILL SEE CONVECTIVE SHOWERS FROM ABOUT THE ADIRONDACKS EASTWARD. MAX TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN THE UPPER 70S TO AROUND 80. SPC HAS MOST OF OUR FORECAST AREA IN MARGINAL FOR TOMORROW. WITH HIGH SURFACE DEW POINTS AND INCREASING DEEP LAYER SHEAR AHEAD OF APPROACHING MID LEVEL JET...MAY SEE SOME ORGANIZED STORMS CAUSE DAMAGING WINDS. STORMS WILL WEAKEN WITH LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING WHILE MOVING EAST OF OUR AREA. FROM TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT BEHIND THE DEPARTING COLD FRONT OUR REGION WILL BE IN COLDER AIR MASS. MAX TEMPS ON WED WILL BE ABOUT 20 DEGREES COOLER THAN THE PAST COUPLE DAYS DROPPING BELOW SEASONAL NORMALS. WILL HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO FROST POSSIBILITIES ESPECIALLY WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  
A NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT SOUTHWEST OF THE REGION LIFTS NORTHEAST AS A WARM FRONT THIS MORNING...AND THEN A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE REGION EARLY TONIGHT FOLLOWED BY HIGH PRESSURE WEDNESDAY.  IFR AND LIFR CIGS AND VSBY CONT TO MOVE WEST ACROSS THE ENTIRE REGION AS SHOWERS DEVELOP FROM EASTERN PA EAST ACROSS NJ. CONDS SHOULD IMPROVE TO MVFR THEN VFR AT WRN TERMINALS BY AFTN...BUT REMAIN IFR TO MVFR AT ERN TERMINALS.  CAN NOT RULE OUT AN ISOLATED TSTM WITH THE APPROACH OF THE WARM FRONT OVERNIGHT AS WELL AS WITH THE APPROACH OF THE COLD FRONT THIS EVENING.  SE WINDS LESS THAN 10 KT BECOME SW AROUND 10 KT WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE WARM FRONT AFT SUNRISE FROM W TO E. WINDS SHIFT FROM THE NW AT 15 TO 25 KT WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE COLD FRONT AFTER SUNSET THIS EVENING.  
EVE. NW WINDS G20-25KT POSSIBLE POST FRONTAL. 
WARM AND MUGGY CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE NIGHT WITH ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH SUNRISE. A COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP THROUGH THE AREA BY EARLY AFTERNOON TUESDAY WITH MORE SHOWERS AND STORMS POSSIBLE. MUCH COOLER WEATHER WILL FOLLOW BEHIND THE FRONT FOR THE MIDDLE AND LATER PART OF THE WEEK.  
500 MB HEIGHT FALLS WERE OCCURRING ACROSS THE REGION THIS EVENING SUPPORTED BY MODEST MID-UPR LEVEL DIVERGENCE ALOFT. A SERIES OF WEAK MID-LVL IMPULSES ARE PROGGED TO CONTINUE TO SLIDE FROM THE OHIO VALLEY OFF TO THE NORTHEAST ACROSS WESTERN...THEN CENTRAL NEW YORK AS THE ENTIRE COMPLEX SYSTEM DRIFTS EASTWARD. MODERATE SFC BASED INSTABILITY WILL WANE WITH THE LOSS OF SOLAR HEATING... HOWEVER...ANOMALOUS MOISTURE IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER WILL REMAIN AND CONTRIBUTE TO A LINGERING INSTABILITY AXIS ACROSS CNTRL NY AND NRN PA THROUGH THE NIGHT. FORECAST WAS GENERALLY IN GOOD SHAPE TO ACCOUNT FOR OCCASIONAL ROUNDS OF TSRA THROUGH THE NIGHT. GFS/GGEM AND HRRR MODELS DO SUGGEST A POTENTIAL ENHANCEMENT OF HEAVIER STORMS FOCUSING AGAIN FROM SOUTH CNTRL PA INTO CNTRL NY BETWEEN 03Z-09Z WHICH MATCHES WELL WITH THE INSTABILITY AXIS. WE ARE NO LONGER THINKING ANY ORGANIZED SEVERE WEATHER OVERNIGHT...BUT HEAVY RAIN POTENTIAL DOES REMAIN. THE QUESTION BEING IS THERE ENOUGH EVIDENCE AND CONFIDENCE TO HOIST A FLASH FLOOD WATCH AS THERE HAVE BEEN LOCALIZED AREAS OF EXTREME RAINFALL TODAY...ESPECIALLY HERE IN THE HOME COUNTY.  RIGHT NOW...WE THINK THE CONVECTIVE STRENGTH WILL BE WEAKER THAN EARLIER TODAY GIVEN THE LOSS OF BUOYANCY AND REALLY NO SIGNIFICANT PUNCH TO THE DYNAMIC FORCING. CAN`T TOTALLY RULE OUT SOME HEAVIER DOWNPOURS AND POTENTIAL OVERWHELMING OF STORM DRAINS IN ANY DEVELOPED TOWN OR CITY THAT MIGHT GET A SLOW MOVING STORM...BUT WILL DEAL WITH THAT ON THE SHORT TERM SHOULD IT UNFOLD.  OTHERWISE...JUST MINOR CHANGES THIS EVENING TO ADJUST FOR TEMPS IN THE MARINE LAYER TO OUR EAST PUSHING WESTWARD.  COLD FRONT THEN SWEEPS INTO AND THROUGH THE REGION ON TUESDAY MORNING WITH IMPROVING AND COOLER WEATHER DURING THE AFTERNOON.  
QUIET WEATHER IS EXPECTED THROUGH THIS PERIOD WITH MUCH LOWER TEMPERATURES BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES TOWARD THE MID-ATLANTIC WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. LOW PRESSURE IS FORECAST TO TRACK FROM THE TENNESSEE VALLEY TOWARD THE CAROLINAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY WITH ASSOCIATED RAIN WELL TO OUR SOUTH. GENERALLY WENT WITH A BLEND OF MAV/MET GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WHICH YIELDED UNSEASONABLY COOL HIGHS IN THE MID 50S TO MID 60S ON WEDNESDAY... WARMING A BIT INTO THE 60S ON THURSDAY. LOWS WEDNESDAY NIGHT WILL RANGE FROM THE MID 30S TO MID 40S WITH A TOUCH OF FROST NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION IN NORMALLY COOLER LOCATIONS.  
COLDER AIR WILL CONTINUE TO ADVECT INTO THE REGION WITH 850 MB TEMPERATURES FALLING TO NEAR -4C BY WEDNESDAY MORNING. TEMPERATURES TUESDAY NIGHT WILL FALL WELL INTO THE 40S WITH SOME UPPER 30S ACROSS THE NORMALLY COLDER LOCATIONS ALONG THE SOUTHERN TIER AND EAST OF LAKE ONTARIO. THE FROST RISK LOOKS LIMITED FOR THE COLDEST SPOTS AS THERE WILL BE SOME GRADIENT AND THERE SHOULD BE A DECENT AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVER AS A TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH ALONG WITH SOME LAKE-ENHANCED CLOUD COVER.  SUNSHINE WILL INCREASE WEDNESDAY AS THE CORE OF THE COLDEST AIR STARTS TO SHIFT OFF TO THE EAST. IT WILL STILL BE A COOL DAY... ABOUT 5 TO 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL WITH HIGHS ONLY IN THE MID TO UPPER 50S.  SKIES WILL LIKELY CLEAR OFF WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH DECENT CHANCES OF FROST FOR INTERIOR SECTIONS IF WINDS CAN DROP OFF ENOUGH.  HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE GREAT LAKES THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT KEEPING THE AREA DRY. TEMPERATURES SHOULD MODERATE A BIT WITH HIGHS THURSDAY INTO THE 60S...BUT STILL A COOL THURSDAY NIGHT WITH LOWS IN THE 40S.  
THIS PERIOD STARTS WITH A SHORT WAVE TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED WEAK COLD FRONT MOVING DOWN FROM CANADA. THIS COULD TRIGGER A FEW SHOWERS ACROSS THROUGH THE REGION FRIDAY. HOWEVER...A LACK OF MOISTURE WILL LIMIT PRECIPITATION CHANCES. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION BEHIND THE FRONT. THIS WILL USHER IN A DRIER BUT COOLER AIR MASS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. OVERNIGHT LOW FRIDAY NIGHT SATURDAY MORNING WILL HAVE TO BE MONITORED FOR POTENTIAL FROST/FREEZE CONDITIONS.  THE HIGH SHIFTS OFF THE EAST COAST SUNDAY...SETTING UP A RETURN FLOW ACROSS THE LOWER GREAT LAKES THAT WILL SIGNAL A RETURN TO WARMER CONDITIONS. UNSETTLED WEATHER WILL RETURN SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY AS A WARM FRONT LIFTS NORTH FROM THE OHIO VALLEY.  
A DISTURBANCE WILL PRODUCE SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM OVERNIGHT. A COLD FRONT WILL BRING A CHANCE OF STRONGER THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY AFTERNOON. A COOLER AIR MASS WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THE COLD FRONT...AND REMAIN OVER THE REGION FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.  
AS OF 145 AM...A 75 TO 125 MILE WIDE BAND OF SHOWERS WITH ISOLATED TSTMS WAS MOVING ACROSS THE FORECAST. CURRENTLY THE LEADING EDGE OF THIS BAND WAS FROM THE LLAKE GEORGE SARATOGA REGION TO THE CAPITAL DISTRICT AND THE EASTERN CATSKILLS. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST WIDESPREAD RAIN EVENT FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA IN MORE THAN THREE WEEKS. HAVE RAISED POPS TO CATEGORICAL IN ALL AREAS FOR A FEW HOURS AS THIS BAND MOVES THROUGH OVERNIGHT AND EARLY TUESDAY MORNING. LOWS TONIGHT WILL BE 50 TO 60.  
ANY LEFT-OVER SHOWERS WILL DIMINISH IN COVERAGE TUESDAY MORNING. HOWEVER...AS A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH SETS UP...THEN A COLD FRONT FOR LATE IN THE DAY...THE STAGE COULD BE SET FOR STRONGER THUNDERSTORM. INITIALLY THE WIND FIELD IS WEAK...BUT A SPEED MAS IS FORECAST TO WORK THROUGH IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COLD FRONT AND A SPIKE ON INSTABILITY.  SBCAPES COULD QUICKLY REACH 1000 J/KG OR BETTER...ESPECIALLY SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL REGION. THE WILD CARD WILL BE HOW MUCH SUNSHINE WILL TAKE PLACE. THE CANADIAN ASTRONOMICAL FORECAST MODEL INDICATED THERE WILL BE A REDUCTION IN CLOUD COVER. ONE OTHER POSSIBLE MITIGATING FACTOR...DEW POINTS MIGHT ACTUALLY DROP A LITTLE BEFORE THE COLD FRONT COMES THROUGH.  FOR NOW...WE DID INTRODUCE ENHANCED WORDING WITH THE CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS TOMORROW...SMALL HAIL AND GUSTY WINDS.  HIGH TEMPERATURES ON TUESDAY LOOK TO BE 75-80 MOST PLACES...A LITTLE COOLER ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN.  COOLER AIR ARRIVES BEHIND THE COLD FRONT FOR TUESDAY NIGHT ALONG WITH A GUSTY BREEZE. TEMPERATURES WILL BACK INTO THE 40S WITH A CLEARING TREND AFTER A RESIDUAL EVENING SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM.  WEDNESDAY WILL BE QUITE BRISK BY MID MAY STANDARDS WITH A MIX OF CLOUDS AND SUN. THERE COULD BE A PASSING SHOWER ACROSS THE ADIRONDACKS. OTHERWISE MAINLY DRY WITH NOTHING MORE THAN A SPRINKLE. HIGHS WILL BE ABOUT 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL...60-65 IN THE VALLEYS...50S ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN.  WEDNESDAY NIGHT WILL BE COOLER WITH LOWS IN THE 30S TO AROUND 40 IN THE IMMEDIATE CAPITAL REGION. THERE COULD BE FROST ISSUES...MAINLY IN THE OUTLYING AREAS. FOR NOW...WILL MENTION THE POSSIBILITY IN THE HWO.  THURSDAY LOOKS DECENT WITH PARTIAL SUNSHINE AS HIGH PRESSURE CRESTS TO OUR SOUTH. TEMPERATURES WILL BE A LITTLE CLOSER TO NORMAL...STILL RUNNING A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. THEY WILL TOP OUT AROUND 70 IN THE VALLEYS... 60S OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN.  THURSDAY NIGHT WILL BE PARTLY CLOUDY WITH LOWS 40S. A SECONDARY UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL SWING THROUGH FRIDAY BRINGING A FEW MORE CLOUDS AND PERHAPS SOME SPRINKLES OR A SHOWER TO THE ADIRONDACKS. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE SIMILAR THURSDAY.  
THE MEMORIAL HOLIDAY  WEEKEND LOOKS TO START OUT FINE AS A LARGE HIGH PRESSURE INTO THE REGION. FRIDAY NIGHT WILL BE COOL WITH SOME POSSIBLE FROST IN THE COLDER OUTLYING AREAS. SATURDAY WILL BE MOSTLY SUNNY WITH HIGHS RECOVERING TO AROUND 70 IN THE VALLEYS...60S HIGHER TERRAIN.  SUNDAY SHOULD BE ANOTHER DECENT DAY AS HIGH PRESSURE ROLLS OFFSHORE. A SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL SEND TEMPERATURES WELL INTO THE 70S ACROSS OUR ENTIRE REGION.  BY MEMORIAL DAY ITSELF...MODEL GUIDANCE IS AT ODDS WITH WHAT WILL HAPPEN. THE 12Z OPERATIONAL EUROPEAN MODEL INDICATED ANOTHER BUBBLE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING BEHIND A WEAK BACKDOOR COLD FRONT WHICH WOULD KEEP US DRY WITH TEMPERATURES AGAIN MAINLY IN THE 70S (SOME 60S NORTH). THIS SOLUTION HAS ACTUALLY BEEN OFFERED IN SEVERAL CONSECUTIVE RUNS.  THE 12Z GFS HOWEVER...BRING MOISTURE AHEAD OF STRONGER COLD FRONT OUR WAY FOR THAT DAY...IMPLYING A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY THUNDERSTORMS. FOR NOW...HAVE COMPROMISED BETWEEN THE TWO SOLUTIONS AND WENT FOR 30 POPS FOR SHOWERS AND A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS.  
NOTE...MOST OF OUR REGION HAS OFFICIALLY BEEN DECLARED "GREENED-UP" EXCLUDING THE ADIRONDACKS...NORTHERN TACONICS...SOUTHERN VERMONT AND THE CATSKILLS.  RH VALUES REMAINED ELEVATED TODAY DESPITE GUSTY SOUTHEAST WINDS.  TONIGHT SHOWERS ARE LIKELY ACROSS THE REGION...AND POSSIBLY A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WITH HEAVIER RAIN. IT IS A GOOD BET (BUT NOT CERTAINTY) THAT A QUARTER INCH OF RAINFALL WILL FALL ACROSS MOST AREAS.  TOMORROW...ANY LEFT-OVER SHOWERS WILL TAPER...BUT THEN AS A PRE- FRONTAL TROUGH SETS UP AND A COLD FRONT LATER ON IN THE DAY...MORE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED. SOME OF THE THUNDERSTORMS COULD CONTAIN GUSTY WINDS AND SMALL HAIL.  IT WILL BE SOMEWHAT BREEZY MOST OF THE NIGHT BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY PREVENT A PARTIAL RECOVERY IN MANY AREAS.  WEDNESDAY LOOKS RATHER WIND WITH RH VALUES DROPPING TO AROUND 30 PERCENT ACROSS MOST AREAS SOUTH OF THE ADIRONDACKS. A NORTHWEST WIND WILL GUST TO AROUND 30 MPH AT TIMES IN MANY LOCATIONS.  AS LONG AS WE GET THE RAIN WE SHOULD BE OKAY. HOWEVER...IF WE DO NOT GET SUBSTANTIAL RAINFALL...WE MIGHT HAVE TO CONSIDER FIRE WEATHER HEADLINES FOR THAT DAY.  IT WILL DRY AGAIN THURSDAY AFTERNOON WITH RH VALUES LIKELY NEAR 30 PERCENT...BUT SHOULD NOT BE QUITE AS BREEZY.  MAINLY DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED INTO THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND.  
NO WIDESPREAD HYDRO PROBLEMS ARE EXPECTED THE NEXT 5 DAYS.  THE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INCREASE WILL INCREASE FROM TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY. MOST OF THE HYDRO SERVICE AREA COULD GET A QUARTER TO HALF INCH OF RAINFALL...BUT LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS ARE POSSIBLE IN THUNDERSTORMS. DRY CONDITIONS WILL RETURN FOR THE MID WEEK PERIOD THROUGH THE END THE WEEK.  FOR DETAILS ON SPECIFIC AREA RIVERS AND LAKES...INCLUDING OBSERVED AND FORECAST RIVER STAGES AND LAKE ELEVATIONS...PLEASE VISIT THE ADVANCED HYDROLOGIC PREDICTION SERVICE /AHPS/ GRAPHS ON OUR WEBSITE.  
A NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT SOUTHWEST OF THE REGION LIFTS NORTHEAST AS A WARM FRONT THIS MORNING...AND THEN A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE REGION EARLY TONIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE IS THEN IN CONTROL THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A DRY COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE ON FRIDAY.  
LOW STRATUS AND FOG WAS MOVING INTO THE REGION FROM THE EAST...ADDED AREAS OF FOG WITH VISIBILITIES 1/2SM FOR OVERNIGHT.  HIGH PRESSURE NEAR NOVA SCOTIA WAS EXTENDING INTO SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND AND ACROSS LONG ISLAND..INTO NEW JERSEY. AN EASTERLY FLOW WAS WELL ESTABLISHED AS FAR WEST AS EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA. WITH A LOW LEVEL INVERSION IN PLACE AND STRATUS ACROSS THE REGION THE AREA WAS STABLE. THE HIGH SHIFTS EAST AFTER 06Z ALLOWING A STATIONARY FRONT IN EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA INTO EASTERN MARYLAND TO BEGIN TO LIFT NORTH AS A WARM FRONT. LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAS BEEN WEAKENING AS LINE MOVES INTO THE MORE STABLE AIRMASS. AS A RESULT HAVE REMOVED THE MENTION OF THUNDER FOR TONIGHT.  POPS LOOK OKAY AND WERE NOT ADJUSTED AT THIS TIME. THE BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS WILL BE ACROSS NJ AND THE LOWER HUDSON VALLEY. AS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE INCREASES...AREAS OF FOG WILL DEVELOP ACROSS LONG ISLAND...SOUTHERN CT...AND COASTAL AREAS...AND PATCHY FOG WILL DEVELOP ELSEWHERE...AND FOG WILL PERSIST THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. LOWS TONIGHT WILL GENERALLY DROP INTO THE 50S...HOLDING NEARLY STEADY ACROSS SOUTHERN CONNECTICUT AND LONG ISLAND.  
THE WARM FRONT MOST LIKELY LIFTS NORTH OF THE REGION EARLY TUESDAY MORNING. A COLD FRONT THEN APPROACHES FROM THE WEST DURING THE DAY TUESDAY. A SOUTHERLY FLOW OUT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT WILL USHER IN A WARMER AND MILDER AIRMASS INTO THE REGION. TEMPERATURES ON TUESDAY WILL TOP OFF IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S ACROSS LONG ISLAND AND SE CT...AND IN THE MIDDLE TO UPPER 70S ACROSS NYC...INTERIOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CT...AND IN THE UPPER 70S TO NEAR 80 ACROSS NE NJ AND THE LOWER HUDSON VALLEY.  THE AIRMASS REMAINS CAPPED AND STABLE THROUGH MUCH OF THE MORNING...THEN WITH A WARM AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS ACROSS THE REGION BY THE AFTERNOON. SHOWERS BECOME LIKELY WITH THE WARM FRONT IN THE MORNING...THE SHOWERS WITH ISOLATED TSTMS POSSIBLE IN THE AFTERNOON AND INTO THE EVENING AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE REGION.  
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR WEDNESDAY. A SHORTWAVE AND SURFACE TROUGH PASS THROUGH...BUT THIS SHOULD DO NOTHING MORE THAN KICK UP THE WINDS AND PRODUCE A FEW CLOUDS...PARTLY CLOUDY AND BREEZY. MAV AND NAM GUIDANCE DIFFER BY ABOUT 4-5 DEGREES FOR HIGH TEMPS. SPLITTING THE DIFFERENCE LOOKS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE 850MB FORECAST AND A MODERATE DOWNSLOPE FLOW.  HIGH PRESSURE KEEPS THURSDAY DRY...AND PROBABLY KEEPS THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY DRY AS WELL. SOME GUIDANCE BRUSHES THE COASTAL ZONES WITH RAINFALL THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING...ASSOCIATED WITH WEAK LOW PRESSURE PASSING SE OF THE 40N/70W BENCHMARK. WILL MAINTAIN A DRY FORECAST FOR NOW. A COLD FRONT FOLLOWS FRIDAY AFTERNOON...BUT EXPECTING A DRY PASSAGE AND INCREASING WIND GUSTS WITH IT. HIGHS NEAR NORMAL ON THURSDAY...AND A LITTLE WARMER ON FRIDAY.  THE COLD ADVECTION BEHIND THE FRONT LEADS TO COOLER HIGH TEMPERATURES FOR SATURDAY...BUT ONLY SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMALS AT MOST. A RETURN SW FLOW FROM HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OFFSHORE THEN PUSHES HIGH TEMPS BACK ABOVE NORMALS ON SUNDAY...BUT STILL IN THE 70S FOR THE MOST PART.  A WARM FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE SW SUNDAY NIGHT. MEANWHILE...A COLD FRONT DROPS DOWN FROM THE NORTH. SOME UNCERTAINTY REGARDING HOW FAR SOUTH IT PUSHES AND THE MAGNITUDE OF COLD ADVECTION WITH IT. WITH INCREASING MOISTURE AND LIFT SUPPLIED BY THE TWO FRONTS...HAVE GONE WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY COULD BE PRESENT FOR A THUNDERSTORM AS WELL.  
VISIBILITIES WERE LOWERING ON THE FORECAST WATERS FROM THE EAST AS LOW STRATUS MOVES IN. ADDED AREAS OF FOG WITH VISIBILITIES A HALF NM OR LESS THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT. AS THE WARM FRONT STARTS TO LIFT NORTH THE VISIBILITIES SHOULD BEGIN TO IMPROVE TOWARD MORNING.  SEAS HAVE SUBSIDED AND WERE AROUND 4 FT ON THE OCEAN WATERS AT 23 UTC. EXPECT FOG TO RE-DEVELOP TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE WATERS LATE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...AND THEN A FEW GUSTS TO 20 KT ARE LIKELY TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE GRADIENT TIGHTENS BEHIND THE DEPARTING COLD FRONT.  SEAS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW 5 FT THROUGH THE REST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. THERE COULD BE HOWEVER BE FREQUENT GUSTS TO SCA CRITERIA WEDNESDAY BEHIND A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE...AND AGAIN ON FRIDAY BEHIND A COLD FRONT.  
BETWEEN 2/10 AND 3/10 INCH OF RAIN IS POSSIBLE FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING. LITTLE OR NO HYDROLOGIC IMPACT IS EXPECTED.  THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK LOOKS TO BE DRY WITH HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL.  
CT...NONE. NY...NONE. NJ...NONE. MARINE...DENSE FOG ADVISORY UNTIL 6 AM EDT EARLY THIS MORNING FOR      ANZ330-335-338-340-345-350-353-355.  
QUIET PD FOR THE XTNDD. SCNDRY FNT APRCHS THE AREA ON FRI AND MGT GENERATE A FEW SHWRS OVER THE NRN AREAS WITH PEAK HTG. HGTS BLDS AGAIN AS SFC HIPRES BLDS IN FOR THE WEEKEND SO XPCT DRY WEATHER INTO SUNDAY. WITH THE TROFINESS ALOFT IN THE PD...TEMPS WILL BE A BIT COOLER THAN NRML DESPITE THE DAYTIME SUN.  
A DISTURBANCE WILL PRODUCE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND MAYBE A RUMBLE OF THUNDER OVERNIGHT. THEN...A COLD FRONT WILL BRING A CHANCE OF STRONGER THUNDERSTORMS ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON. COOLER AIR WILL FOLLOW FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WORKWEEK.  
AS OF 1015 PM EDT...WELL ONCE AGAIN...SHOWERS WHICH PRODUCED AN ESTIMATED HALF TO LOCALLY INCH ACROSS SECTIONS OF SOUTHERN HERKIMER COUNTY.  AS THESE SHOWERS MIGRATED TOWARD THE CAPITAL REGION...THEY SHRIVELED UP. INTERESTINGLY...DEWPOINTS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN FALLING THIS EVENING FROM ALBANY EASTWARD...WITH LITTLE OR NO RAINFALL.  A FEW MORE LIGHT SHOWERS WERE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH. THERE IS ANOTHER LINE OF SHOWERS...WITH LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL OVER CENTRAL NY...COULD MAKE IT INTO THE REGION. ALL THE MESO-SCALE MODELS CLAIM IT WILL.  FOR THIS UPDATE...BACKED POPS DOWN TO HIGH CHANCE FROM THE HUDSON VALLEY EASTWARD...LIKELY (NUMEROUS) TO THE WEST OF THE HUDSON VALLEY.  OVERNIGHT LOWS LOOK REASONABLE AND LEFT ALONE. TEMPERATURES OVERNIGHT WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE 50S.  
AS OF 301 PM EDT MONDAY...A PERUSAL OF THIS MORNING`S GLOBAL MODEL OUTPUT CONTINUES TO SUGGEST ABOVE AVERAGE AGREEMENT ON THE OVERALL WEATHER PATTERN DURING THE THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY TIME FRAME. THUS BY AND LARGE A PERSISTENCE FORECAST WILL BE OFFERED. THE GENERAL PATTERN WILL FEATURE SUBSTANTIAL EASTERN NORTH PACIFIC BLOCKING WHICH WILL TEND TO BE REINFORCED BY INFUSED ENERGY FROM ONCE WEST PAC SUPER TYPHOON NOUL. THIS WILL IN TURN ALLOW A SUPPRESSED POLAR JET AND BROAD-SCALE UPPER TROUGHING TO REMAIN INTACT TO ITS EAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES INTO THE NORTHEASTERN CONUS WITH SEASONABLY COOL AND MAINLY DRY WEATHER EXPECTED. THE BEST SHOT FOR A FEW/SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL OCCUR ON FRIDAY WITH PASSAGE OF A FAIRLY DISTINCT SURFACE TROUGH, OTHERWISE DRY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THROUGH SUNDAY WITH MEAN HIGH PRESSURE DOMINATING IN THE LOWER LEVELS. OF SOME CONCERN WILL BE CHILLY OVERNIGHT LOW TEMPERATURES, WHICH WILL AVERAGE SOME 5-10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING. THUS PATCHY FROST WILL BE QUITE POSSIBLE IN MANY AREAS OUTSIDE THE IMMEDIATE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY, ESPECIALLY ON FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY MORNING WHEN CORE OF THE SURFACE HIGH DRIFTS OVERHEAD.  BY SUNDAY ONWARD UPPER TROUGHING SHOULD BEGIN TO ABATE WITH A MODERATION IN TEMPERATURES EXPECTED. SOME MODEL DISPARITY BY NEXT MONDAY (MEMORIAL DAY) WITH THIS MORNING`S OPERATIONAL RUNS NOW SUGGESTING THAT RESIDUAL NORTHWESTERLY FLOW AT MID-LEVELS MAY SUPPRESS INITIAL RETURN OF WARM/MOIST ADVECTION AND ASSOCIATED PRECIPITATION OFF TO OUR SOUTH AND WEST. FOR NOW WILL MAINTAIN SLIGHT TO LOW CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE ACCOMPANYING ENSEMBLE MEANS.  
AS OF 740 PM EDT MONDAY...LAKE WIND ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT. LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM APPROACHING FROM THE WEST IS BRINGING SOUTHERLY WINDS TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY AT 15 TO 25 KNOTS. WINDS WILL SHIFT INTO THE WEST TUESDAY AFTERNOON WITH PASSAGE OF A COLD FRONT. WINDS COULD INCREASE TO ADVISORY LEVEL AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AT 15-25 KNOTS. WAVES OF 1-3 FEET ARE EXPECTED TONIGHT.  
THROUGH 00Z WEDNESDAY...MAINLY VFR...BUT A PERIOD OF MVFR IS POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING AS SCT SHOWERS WITH ISOLD THUNDER MOVE THROUGH THE REGION. SCT SHOWERS/THUNDER ACROSS NORTHERN NY THIS EVENING WILL TRANSITION TO MORE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS ACROSS THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS/THUNDER THRU 03Z WILL BE AT KSLK/KPBG/KBTV... THEN MAINLY SHOWERS FROM 03-12Z AT MOST TERMINALS WITH PATCHY BR AND MVFR CIGS OVERNIGHT. MVFR IS MOST LIKELY AT KMPV/KSLK. DRIER CONDITIONS AND BECOMING MAINLY VFR TUESDAY MORNING. COLD FRONT WILL BRING CHANCE SHOWERS AND STORMS AFTER 15Z NORTHERN NY AND AFTER 18Z AT VERMONT SITES. ACTIVITY WILL END FROM WEST TO EAST FROM 20Z TUE THRU 00Z WED. WINDS WILL BE SOUTHERLY 5 TO 15 KTS TONIGHT...BECOMING SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST 15 GUSTING 25 KTS TUE.  OUTLOOK 00Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...  00Z WED-00Z THU...MAINLY VFR. GUSTY NW WINDS WED WITH CHC SHOWER.  00Z THU-00Z FRI...VFR WITH HIGH PRESSURE.  00Z FRI-00Z SAT...MAINLY VFR. BRF MVFR PSBL FRI IN SCT SHOWERS.  00Z SAT ONWARD...VFR WITH HIGH PRESSURE.  
A STATIONARY FRONT SOUTHWEST OF THE REGION LIFTS NORTH AS A WARM FRONT EARLY TUESDAY MORNING...AND THEN A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE IS THEN IN CONTROL THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A DRY COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE ON FRIDAY.  
THE WARM FRONT MOST LIKELY LIFTS NORTH OF THE REGION EARLY TUESDAY MORNING. A COLD FRONT THEN APPROACHES FROM THE WEST DURING THE DAY TUESDAY. A SOUTHERLY FLOW OUT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT WILL USHER IN A WARMER AND MILDER AIRMASS INTO THE REGION. TEMPERATURES ON TUESDAY WILL TOP OFF IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S ACROSS LONG ISLAND AND SE CT...AND IN THE MIDDLE TO UPPER 70S ACROSS NYC...INTERIOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CT...AND IN THE UPPER 70S TO NEAR 80 ACROSS NE NJ AND THE LOWER HUDSON VALLEY.  THE AIRMASS REMAINS CAPPED AND STABLE THROUGH MUCH OF THE MORNING...THEN WITH A WARM AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS ACROSS THE REGION BY THE AFTERNOON. SHOWERS BECOME LIKELY WITH THE WARM FRONT IN THE MORNING...THE SHOWERS WITH ISOLATED TSTMS POSSIBLE IN THE AFTERNOON AND INTO THE EVENING AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE REGION.  LOWS WILL DROP INTO THE LOW TO MID 50S.  
HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING INTO THE AREA FROM THE GULF OF MAINE WILL WEAKEN TONIGHT AS ITS CENTER MOVES OUT TO SEA. A FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY FROM CENTRAL NY TO DE OVERNIGHT...POSSIBLY DISSIPATING BEFORE MOVING INTO THE AREA TUESDAY MORNING.  IFR/LIFR CONDS HAVE MADE IT INTO KGON/KISP/KJFK. VSBYS ARE SLOWER TO COME DOWN...BUT WITH ONSHORE FLOW DECREASING...EXPECT THEM TO DROP AS WELL. EXPECT THESE SAME CONDITIONS TO EXPAND ACROSS MOST IF NOT ALL TERMINALS TONIGHT WITH A SE FLOW DEVELOPING. BIGGEST UNCERTAINTY IN THE FORECASTS ARE THE TIMING OF LOWER CONDS...WHEN/WHERE RAIN DEVELOPS AND WIND SHIFTS. WINDS ARE SLOWLY BECOMING ESE/SE AS RIDGE AXIS SINKS SWD. INITIAL LINE OF SHOWERS WEAKENED AS THEY MOVED INTO THE HUDSON VALLEY AND NJ...AND HI RES MODELS INDICATE NOTHING UNTIL AROUND 07Z.  HOWEVER...THERE IS UNCERTAINTY WITH HOW WIDESPREAD THE SHOWERS WILL BE SINCE THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY MAY NOT MOVE MUCH BEFORE DISSIPATING. BUT AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM CANNOT BE RULED OUT TUESDAY MORNING IN ANYTHING THAT DOES MAKE IT IN.  CONDS SHOULD IMPROVE TO MVFR THEN VFR AT WRN TERMINALS TUE AFTN...BUT REMAIN IFR TO MVFR AT ERN TERMINALS.

THE EVE. NW WINDS G20-25KT POSSIBLE POST FRONTAL. 
CT...NONE. NY...NONE. NJ...NONE. MARINE...DENSE FOG ADVISORY UNTIL 6 AM EDT TUESDAY FOR ANZ330-335-338-      340-345-350-353-355.  
VERY ACTIVE WEATHER WAS FOUND ACROSS THE WESTERN SOUTHERN TIER AND FINGER LAKES REGION DURING THE EVENING HOURS...AS A MOISTURE RICH AIRMASS WITH PWAT VALUES OF 1.75 INCHES SUPPORTED SOME FLASH FLOODING ALONG WITH FAIRLY WIDESPREAD THUNDERSTORM WIND DAMAGE.  A MESO-CYCLONE DEVELOPED ALONG A SFC BASED BOUNDARY OVER THE SRN TIER...AND THIS FEATURE WORKED ITS WAY EAST NORTHEAST ACROSS THE FINGER LAKES DURING THE COURSE OF THE EVENING. THIS STORM PRODUCED ENOUGH WIND TO BRING DOWN TREES AND POWER LINES.  THE STORMS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SEVERE WEATHER AND FLOODING HAVE SINCE PUSHED AWAY TO THE EAST. DRIER MID LEVEL AIR IS NOW STARTING TO WORK IN FROM SOUTHERN ONTARIO AS NOCTURNAL STABILIZATION IS BECOMING ESTABLISHED. THE ONLY SHOWERS REMAINING FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT WILL BE EAST OF THE GENESEE VALLEY.  THE ACTUAL SFC FRONT WILL CROSS THE REGION TUESDAY MORNING. IN THE WAKE OF THIS FRONT...H85 TEMPS WILL DROP FROM THE DOUBLE DIGITS TO BETWEEN 2 AND 4C BY LATE AFTERNOON. THUS TEMPERATURES ACROSS WESTERN NY WILL RECOVER INTO THE LOW-MID 60S TUESDAY MORNING... BEFORE DROPPING OFF THROUGH THE 50S BY LATE TUESDAY AFTERNOON. FARTHER EAST ACROSS THE FINGER LAKES REGION...TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECOVER A LITTLE LONGER BEFORE THE COOLER AIR ARRIVES... AND THUS SOME LOW 70S ARE LIKELY THERE BEFORE COOLING THROUGH THE LATE AFTERNOON. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ANY LINGERING EARLY DAY SHOWERS IN THE NORTH COUNTRY...TUESDAY SHOULD BE DRY AND TURNING SUNNY FOR MOST AREAS.  
WHILE THE BULK OF THE REGION WILL EXPERIENCE VFR CONDITIONS OVERNIGHT...SOME STRATUS AND/OR AREAS OF DENSE FOG WILL LIKELY DEVELOP WHERE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FORMED EARLIER IN THE EVENING. THIS WOULD INCLUDE SITES SUCH AS KJHW AND KELZ... WHERE LIFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FOR MUCH OF THE REST OF THE NIGHT.  IN THE WAKE OF A COLD FRONT ON TUESDAY...VFR CONDITIONS WILL BE FOUND ACROSS WESTERN AND NORTH CENTRAL NEW YORK.  OUTLOOK... TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...VFR.  
A COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP ACROSS THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES LATE TONIGHT/TUESDAY WITH AN INCREASE IN WIND SPEED AND WAVE ACTION INTO TUESDAY. A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR THE LAKE ERIE NEARSHORES COVERING TUESDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN BUILD OVER THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK WITH LOW WIND AND WAVE ACTION.  
NY...NONE. MARINE...SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FROM NOON TO 11 PM EDT TUESDAY FOR LEZ040-          041.  
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE THIS AFTERNOON AND INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TUESDAY WITH COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE. FROM TUESDAY NIGHT ONWARD THE WEATHER WILL BE FAIRLY QUIET AND COOL.  
AS OF 1021 PM EDT MONDAY...GOING FORECAST REMAINS IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE. INITIAL CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY STARTING TO WANE BUT STILL SEEING AN AREA OF SHOWERS/EMBEDDED THUNDER FROM THE ADIRONDACKS STRETCHING UP TO NEAR MONTREAL. SECOND MORE ORGANIZED AREA OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS BACK NEAR SYRACUSE SOUTHWARD WILL GRADUALLY WEAKEN BUT STILL CONTINUE SPREADING UP TO THE NORTH AND EAST. PREVIOUS DISCUSSION FROM 707 PM MONDAY FOLLOWS.  TWO DICHOTOMOUS AIR MASSES EXIST THIS EVENING WITH A MORE SPRINGLIKE MARINE-INFLUENCED AIR MASS ACROSS EASTERN VERMONT...WHILE AREAS FROM THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY WEST ACROSS NEW YORK HAVE AN AIR MASS MORE SUITABLE FOR MID-SUMMER. TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S WITH DEW POINTS 65-70 DEGREES IN THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY AND PARTS OF THE ADIRONDACKS HAVE LED TO BETWEEN 1000-2000 J/KG OF CAPE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. WITH LITTLE TO NO SHEAR PRESENT...ORGANIZATION IS NOT EXPECTED AND STORMS WILL BE COLD- POOL DRIVEN. MAIN IMPACTS WILL BE HEAVY RAIN (PWAT VALUES NEAR 1.75" AND WARM CLOUD DEPTHS APPROACHING 10K FEET)...BRIEFLY GUSTY WINDS UP TO 30 MPH...AND SOME OCCASIONAL LIGHTNING. CONVECTION SHOULD BE MAINLY CONFINED TO NORTHERN NEW YORK THIS EVENING...ALTHOUGH SOME PROPAGATION INTO VERMONT IS POSSIBLE. AS INITIAL CONVECTION BEGINS TO DECAY HEADING INTO TONIGHT...THE CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY OUT ACROSS WESTERN NY AND PA THIS EVENING WILL BE MOVING TOWARDS THE REGION...LIKELY BEING SOMEWHAT MAINTAINED SYNOPTICALLY BY AN UPPER SHORTWAVE COMING OUT OF THE OHIO VALLEY. BY THE TIME IT REACHES THE AREA OVERNIGHT THOUGH IT SHOULD BE LARGELY REDUCED TO SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY SOME LINGERING ELEVATED THUNDER. OTHERWISE...SOUTHERLY FLOW AND INCREASED LOW LEVEL DEW POINTS WILL KEEP MILD TEMPERATURES IN PLACE THROUGH THE NIGHT...WITH LOWS FROM 55-65F.  
AS OF 348 PM EDT MONDAY...ON TUESDAY A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH WEST TO EAST ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA. AS SURFACE HEATS UP AND SOME CAPE DEVELOPS WILL SEE CONVECTIVE SHOWERS FROM ABOUT THE ADIRONDACKS EASTWARD. MAX TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN THE UPPER 70S TO AROUND 80. SPC HAS MOST OF OUR FORECAST AREA IN MARGINAL FOR TOMORROW. WITH HIGH SURFACE DEWPOINTS AND INCREASING DEEP LAYER SHEAR AHEAD OF APPROACHING MID LEVEL JET...MAY SEE SOME ORGANIZED STORMS CAUSE DAMAGING WINDS. STORMS WILL WEAKEN WITH LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING WHILE MOVING EAST OF OUR AREA. FROM TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT BEHIND THE DEPARTING COLD FRONT OUR REGION WILL BE IN COLDER AIR MASS. MAX TEMPS ON WED WILL BE ABOUT 20 DEGREES COOLER THAN THE PAST COUPLE DAYS DROPPING BELOW SEASONAL NORMALS. WILL HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO FROST POSSIBILITIES ESPECIALLY WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  
MVFR CONDITIONS WERE NOTED AT KPOU AND KPSF. CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO DETERIORATE TO MVFR AT KALB AND KGFL AS SHOWERS MOVE INTO AND STRATUS CLOUDS LOWER. IN FACT...WE BELIEVE THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE OF IFR AT KPOU AND KPSF LATER BETWEEN ABOUT 08Z-12Z. WE HELD CONDITIONS AT THE LOWER END OF MVFR (EXTRA FUEL REQUIRED) AT KALB AND KGFL AFTER 06Z.  CONDITIONS SHOULD IMPROVE BACK TO VFR BY LATE MORNING AT ALL THE TERMINALS. HOWEVER...A STRONG COLD FRONT WILL BRING THE THREAT OF ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. AT THIS POINT...THE THREAT APPEARED TO LOW TO INCLUDE EVEN A PROB30 GROUP AT THIS TIME...BUT WILL MONITOR. ANY THUNDERSTORM ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON COULD CONTAIN GUSTY WINDS AND SMALL HAIL.  SURFACE WINDS WILL BE SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST THIS EVENING...OCCASIONALLY GUSTING TO 25-30 KTS AT KALB. THEY WILL DIMINISH OVERNIGHT BUT STILL 5-10KTS.  ON TUESDAY...THE SURFACE WIND WILL BE AROUND 10KTS FROM THE SOUTH OR SOUTHWEST...SHIFTING TO NW AT 21Z AT KALB AND 22Z AT KPSF WITH SOME GUSTS BACK UP TO 20KTS.  OUTLOOK...  TUESDAY NIGHT: MODERATE OPERATIONAL IMPACT. CHANCE OF SHRA. WEDNESDAY: LOW OPERATIONAL IMPACT. BREEZY. NO SIG WX. WEDNESDAY NIGHT: NO OPERATIONAL IMPACT. NO SIG WX. THURSDAY TO SATURDAY: NO OPERATIONAL IMPACT. NO SIG WX.  
NO WIDESPREAD HYDRO PROBLEMS ARE EXPECTED THE NEXT 5 DAYS.  THE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INCREASE WILL INCREASE FROM TONIGHT THHROUGH TUESDAY. MOST OF THE HYDRO SERVICE AREA COULD GET A QUARTER TO HALF INCH OF RAINFALL...BUT LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS ARE POSSIBLE IN THUNDERSTORMS. DRY CONDITIONS WILL RETURN FOR THE MID WEEK PERIOD THROUGH THE END THE WEEK.  FOR DETAILS ON SPECIFIC AREA RIVERS AND LAKES...INCLUDING OBSERVED AND FORECAST RIVER STAGES AND LAKE ELEVATIONS...PLEASE VISIT THE ADVANCED HYDROLOGIC PREDICTION SERVICE /AHPS/ GRAPHS ON OUR WEBSITE.  
HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING INTO THE AREA FROM THE GULF OF MAINE WILL WEAKEN TONIGHT AS ITS CENTER MOVES OUT TO SEA. A FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY FROM CENTRAL NY TO DE OVERNIGHT...POSSIBLY DISSIPATING BEFORE MOVING INTO THE AREA TUESDAY MORNING.  MONITORING STRATUS/FOG BANK APPROACHING FROM THE E. OBS ACROSS CAPE COD AND BLOCK ISLAND HAVE DROPPED TO LIFR IN IT AND EXPECT THE SAME CONDITIONS TO DEVELOP ACROSS MOST IF NOT ALL TERMINALS TONIGHT WITH A SE FLOW DEVELOPING. BIGGEST UNCERTAINTY IN THE FORECASTS ARE THE TIMING OF LOWER CONDS...WHEN/WHERE RAIN DEVELOPS AND WIND SHIFTS. WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE SE IF THE SFC RIDGE AXIS DROPS S. OTHERWISE ONCE IT WEAKENS. HI RES MODELS INDICATE LINE OF SHRA/TSTMS OVER ERN PA WEAKENS AND DOESN`T AFFECT ANY TERMINALS...ALTHOUGH WILL BE MONITORING AND AMENDING ACCORDINGLY.  THERE IS ALSO UNCERTAINTY WITH HOW WIDESPREAD THE SHOWERS WILL BE LATE TONIGHT INTO TUE MORNING SINCE THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY MAY NOT MOVE MUCH BEFORE DISSIPATING. AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM CANNOT BE RULED OUT TUESDAY MORNING IN ANYTHING THAT DOES MAKE IT IN.  CONDS SHOULD IMPROVE TO MVFR THEN VFR AT WRN TERMINALS TUE AFTN...BUT REMAIN IFR TO MVFR AT ERN TERMINALS. COLD FRONT APPROACHES FOR THE EVE.       NY METRO ENHANCED AVIATION WEATHER SUPPORT...

HIGH PRESSURE NEAR NOVA SCOTIA WAS EXTENDING INTO SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND AND ACROSS LONG ISLAND..INTO NEW JERSEY. AN EASTERLY FLOW WAS WELL ESTABLISHED AS FAR WEST AS EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA. WITH A LOW LEVEL INVERSION IN PLACE AND STRATUS ACROSS THE REGION THE AREA WAS STABLE. THE HIGH SHIFTS EAST AFTER 06Z ALLOWING A STATIONARY FRONT IN EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA INTO EASTERN MARYLAND TO BEGIN TO LIFT NORTH AS A WARM FRONT. LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAS BEEN WEAKENING AS LINE MOVES INTO THE MORE STABLE AIRMASS. AS A RESULT HAVE REMOVED THE MENTION OF THUNDER FOR TONIGHT.  POPS LOOK OKAY AND WERE NOT ADJUSTED AT THIS TIME. THE BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS WILL BE ACROSS NJ AND THE LOWER HUDSON VALLEY. AS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE INCREASES...AREAS OF FOG WILL DEVELOP ACROSS LONG ISLAND...SOUTHERN CT...AND COASTAL AREAS...AND PATCHY FOG WILL DEVELOP ELSEWHERE...AND FOG WILL PERSIST THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. LOWS TONIGHT WILL GENERALLY DROP INTO THE 50S...HOLDING NEARLY STEADY ACROSS SOUTHERN CONNECTICUT AND LONG ISLAND.  
SEAS HAVE SUBSIDED AND WERE AROUND 4 FT ON THE OCEAN WATERS AT 23 UTC. EXPECT FOG TO RE-DEVELOP TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE WATERS LATE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...AND THEN A FEW GUSTS TO 20 KT ARE LIKELY TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE GRADIENT TIGHTENS BEHIND THE DEPARTING COLD FRONT.  SEAS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW 5 FT THROUGH THE REST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. THERE COULD BE HOWEVER BE FREQUENT GUSTS TO SCA CRITERIA WEDNESDAY BEHIND A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE...AND AGAIN ON FRIDAY BEHIND A COLD FRONT.  
500 MB HEIGHT FALLS WERE OCCURRING ACROSS THE REGION THIS EVENING SUPPORTED BY MODEST MID-UPR LEVEL DIVERGENCE ALOFT. A SERIES OF WEAK MID-LVL IMPULSES ARE PROGGED TO CONTINUE TO SLIDE FROM THE OHIO VALLEY OFF TO THE NORTHEAST ACROSS WESTERN...THEN CENTRAL NEW YORK AS THE ENTIRE COMPLEX SYSTEM DRIFTS EASTWARD. MODERATE SFC BASED INSTABILITY WILL WANE WITH THE LOSS OF SOLAR HEATING... HOWEVER...ANOMALOUS MOISTURE IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER WILL REMAIN AND CONTRIBUTE TO A LINGERING INSTABILITY AXIS ACROSS CNTRL NY AND NRN PA THROUGH THE NIGHT. FORECAST WAS GENERALLY IN GOOD SHAPE TO ACCOUNT FOR OCCASIONAL ROUNDS OF TSRA THROUGH THE NIGHT. GFS/GGEM AND HRRR MODELS DO SUGGEST A POTENTIAL ENHANCEMENT OF HEAVIER STORMS FOCUSING AGAIN FROM SOUTH CNTRL PA INTO CNTRL NY BETWEEN 03Z-09Z WHICH MATCHES WELL WITH THE INSTABILTY AXIS. WE ARE NO LONGER THINKING ANY ORGANIZED SEVERE WEATHER OVERNIGHT...BUT HEAVY RAIN POTENTIAL DOES REMAIN. THE QUESTION BEING IS THERE ENOUGH EVIDENCE AND CONFIDENCE TO HOIST A FLASH FLOOD WATCH AS THERE HAVE BEEN LOCALIZED AREAS OF EXTREME RAINFALL TODAY...ESPECIALLY HERE IN THE HOME COUNTY.  RIGHT NOW...WE THINK THE CONVECTIVE STRENGTH WILL BE WEAKER THAN EARLIER TODAY GIVEN THE LOSS OF BUOYANCY AND REALLY NO SIGNIFICANT PUNCH TO THE DYNAMIC FORCING. CAN`T TOTALLY RULE OUT SOME HEAVIER DOWNPOURS AND POTENTIAL OVERWHELMING OF STORM DRAINS IN ANY DEVELOPED TOWN OR CITY THAT MIGHT GET A SLOW MOVING STORM...BUT WILL DEAL WITH THAT ON THE SHORT TERM SHOULD IT UNFOLD.  OTHERWISE...JUST MINOR CHANGES THIS EVENING TO ADJUST FOR TEMPS IN THE MARINE LAYER TO OUR EAST PUSHING WESTWARD.  COLD FRONT THEN SWEEPS INTO AND THROUGH THE REGION ON TUESDAY MORNING WITH IMPROVING AND COOLER WEATHER DURING THE AFTERNOON.  
APPROACHING UPPER LEVEL TROF AND ASSOCIATED SFC COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE REGION OVERNIGHT BRINGING WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND CIG RESTRICTIONS. IN GENERAL, WIDESPREAD LOW MVFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED LATER THIS EVENING WITH CIGS AT KAVP/BGM DROPPING TO IFR DUE TO MARINE LAYER. FRONTAL PASSAGE WILL OCCUR AROUND 15Z WITH CONDITIONS GRADUALLY IMPROVING TO VFR BY MIDDAY TO EARLY AFTERNOON.  S/SE WINDS OVERNIGHT AROUND 5-10 KNOTS BECOMING SOUTHWEST AROUND MID MORNING AT 10 KNOTS THEN NW BY AFTERNOON AT 10-15 KNOTS WITH GUSTS AROUND 25 KNOTS.  
AS OF 707 PM EDT MONDAY...TWO DICHOTOMOUS AIR MASSES EXIST THIS EVENING WITH A MORE SPRINGLIKE MARINE-INFLUENCED AIR MASS ACROSS EASTERN VERMONT...WHILE AREAS FROM THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY WEST ACROSS NEW YORK HAVE AN AIR MASS MORE SUITABLE FOR MID-SUMMER. TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S WITH DEW POINTS 65-70 DEGREES IN THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY AND PARTS OF THE ADIRONDACKS HAVE LED TO BETWEEN 1000-2000 J/KG OF CAPE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. WITH LITTLE TO NO SHEAR PRESENT...ORGANIZATION IS NOT EXPECTED AND STORMS WILL BE COLD- POOL DRIVEN. MAIN IMPACTS WILL BE HEAVY RAIN (PWAT VALUES NEAR 1.75" AND WARM CLOUD DEPTHS APPROACHING 10K FEET)...BRIEFLY GUSTY WINDS UP TO 30 MPH...AND SOME OCCASIONAL LIGHTNING. CONVECTION SHOULD BE MAINLY CONFINED TO NORTHERN NEW YORK THIS EVENING...ALTHOUGH SOME PROPAGATION INTO VERMONT IS POSSIBLE. AS INITIAL CONVECTION BEGINS TO DECAY HEADING INTO TONIGHT...THE CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY OUT ACROSS WESTERN NY AND PA THIS EVENING WILL BE MOVING TOWARDS THE REGION...LIKELY BEING SOMEWHAT MAINTAINED SYNOPTICALLY BY AN UPPER SHORTWAVE COMING OUT OF THE OHIO VALLEY. BY THE TIME IT REACHES THE AREA OVERNIGHT THOUGH IT SHOULD BE LARGELY REDUCED TO SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY SOME LINGERING ELEVATED THUNDER. OTHERWISE...SOUTHERLY FLOW AND INCREASED LOW LEVEL DEW POINTS WILL KEEP MILD TEMPERATURES IN PLACE THROUGH THE NIGHT...WITH LOWS FROM 55-65F.  
A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH ACROSS THE REGION TONIGHT...BRINGING SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK...BRINGING DRY WEATHER AND COOLER TEMPERATURES...WITH HIGHS MAINLY IN THE 60S. HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLIDE EAST OF THE AREA BY THE WEEKEND...AND THIS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO RECOVER BACK INTO THE 70S FOR THE WEEKEND.  
THE FORECAST AREA REMAINS BETWEEN A RIDGE AXIS TO OUR EAST AND AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER THE UPPER GREAT LAKES...PRODUCING SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT ACROSS WESTERN AND CENTRAL NEW YORK. PW VALUES ON THE 12Z KBUF SOUNDING WERE AROUND 1.5 INCHES AND CURRENT MESOANALYSIS SUGGEST MOISTURE ADVECTION HAS PUSHED THESE VALUES TO NEAR 1.7 INCHES.  SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK SHORTWAVE HAVE BROUGHT TORRENTIAL DOWNPOURS AND SOME SEVERE WEATHER TO THE SOUTHERN TIER THIS EVENING. ONE CELL IN PARTICULAR HAS EXHIBITED BROAD ROTATION...AND THIS MESOCYCLONE WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK EAST NORTHEAST ACROSS ALLEGANY COUNTY WHERE ANOTHER SVR IS ALREADY IN PLACE. ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORMS ARE BLOSSOMING IN ADVANCE OF THIS FEATURE...WHICH SEEMS TO BE TIED TO A LOW LEVEL BOUNDARY THAT IS NOT DETECTABLE BY RADAR OR SATELLITE. ALL OF THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD WEAKEN AS WE APPROACH MIDNIGHT AND THE AIRMASS STARTS TO STABILIZE SOMEWHAT.  OVERNIGHT...A COLD FRONT WILL CROSS THE AREA AS THE SURFACE LOW TRACKS ACROSS SOUTHERN ONTARIO. WITH DRIER AIR MOVING INTO WESTERN NEW YORK...ANY REMAINING SHOWER ACTIVITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE FINGER LAKES REGION. OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL NOT FALL QUICKLY WITH REMAIN LOW-LEVEL CLOUD COVER HANGING AROUND THROUGH THE NIGHT. BY TUESDAY CLEARING WILL WORK ACROSS THE AREA FROM WEST TO EAST..AS WILL COOLER 850MB TEMPS...DROPPING INTO THE +2 TO +4 C RANGE. THUS TEMPERATURES ACROSS WESTERN NY WILL RECOVER INTO THE LOW-MID 60S TUESDAY MORNING...BEFORE DROPPING OFF THROUGH THE 50S BY LATE TUESDAY AFTERNOON. FARTHER EAST ACROSS THE FINGER LAKES REGION...TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECOVER A LITTLE LONGER BEFORE THE COOLER AIR ARRIVES...AND THUS SOME LOW 70S ARE LIKELY THERE BEFORE COOLING THROUGH THE LATE AFTERNOON. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ANY LINGERING EARLY DAY SHOWERS IN THE NORTH COUNTRY...TUESDAY SHOULD BE DRY AND TURNING SUNNY FOR MOST AREAS.  
WHILE MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL BE IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION TONIGHT...SHOWERS AND HEAVY THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE OUT OF THE SOUTHERN TIER AND CROSS PORTIONS OF THE FINGER LAKES REGION THROUGH 02Z. AREAS THAT RECEIVED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL LIKELY EXPERIENCE REDUCED VSBYS AFTER 06Z...WITH SOME SITES DETERIORATING TO IFR LEVELS. THIS WOULD INCLUDE KJHW AND KELZ.  IN THE WAKE OF A COLD FRONT ON TUESDAY...VFR CONDITIONS WILL BE FOUND ACROSS WESTERN AND NORTH CENTRAL NEW YORK.  OUTLOOK... TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...VFR.  
A COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP ACROSS THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES LATE TONIGHT/TUESDAY WITH AN INCREASE IN WIND SPEED AND WAVE ACTION INTO TUESDAY. A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR THE LAKE ERIE NEARSHORES COVERING TUESDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN BUILD OVER THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK WITH LOW WIND AND WAVE ACTION.  
A SOUTHERLY FLOW HAS BROUGHT STRATUS TO THE SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL REGION. THESE WILL TEND TO DISSIPATE A LITTLE THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...A COLD FRONT TO OUR WEST WILL TRIGGER THE THREAT FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THIS COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY MOVE ACROSS THE REGION TUESDAY AFTERNOON...AND THE THREAT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE. A MUCH COOLER AIR MASS WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THE COLD FRONT...WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES EXPECTED FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.  
AS OF 755 PM EDT...SCATTERED SHOWERS MAINLY JUST TO THE WEST OF THE CAPITAL REGION ALONG WITH OCCASIONAL CLOUD TO GROUND LIGHTNING STRIKE. EARLIER...THUNDERSTORMS WERE A LITTLE STRONGER AND INCLUDED POSITIVE CLOUD TO GROUND LIGHTNING STRIKES. AS THE STORMS MOVED INTO MORE STABLE AIR THEY HAVE WEAKENED.  WITH SOME GOOD MOISTURE POOLING ALONG A STALLED OUT BOUNDARY JUST TO THE WEST OF THE HUDSON VALLEY...IT LOOKS AS IF THESE SHOWERS SHOULD WORK INTO MUCH OF OUR REGION THIS EVENING.  UPSTREAM...THERE WAS ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEXT SHORT WAVE. IF THESE HOLD TOGETHER (AND THEY SHOULD) THEY WOULD WORK INTO OUR WESTERN AREAS LATER THIS EVENING AND MOST OTHER REGION OVERNIGHT. THE BEST THETA-E ADVECTION AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE POOLING LOOKS TO GO THE NORTHWEST OF THE CAPITAL REGION.  THIS COULD BE A BENEFICIAL RAIN AS IT HAS REMAINED EXCEPTIONALLY DRY WITH ONLY 0.06 INCHES RECORDED AT THE ALBANY AIRPORT SO FAR THIS MONTH! THIS HAS BEEN THE DRIEST MAY ON RECORD SO FAR IN OUR REGION.  TEMPERATURES WERE GENERALLY IN THE 70S TO THE WEST OF THE CAPITAL REGION (EXCEPT COOLER WHERE IT HAS RAINED). COOLER TEMPERATURES WERE FOUND TO MAINLY THE SOUTHEAST OF THE CAPITAL REGION WHERE A MARINE LAYER HAS DROPPED THEM INTO THE 60S...AND EVEN SOME 50S.  FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING...SHOWERS LOOK TO INCREASE IN COVERAGE. WHILE THE INSTABILITY HAS WEAKENED TO THE WEST OF ALBANY (UNDER 1000 J/KG) SHOWALTER VALUES AROUND 0 MIGHT ALLOW FOR SOME ELEVATED CONVECTION. WILL CONTINUE WITH SLIGHT CHANCES OF THUNDER.  TEMPERATURES OVERNIGHT WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE 50S.  
SHOWERS PROBABLY DIMINISH IN COVERAGE TUESDAY MORNING. HOWEVER...AS A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH SETS UP...THEN A COLD FRONT FOR LATE IN THE DAY...THE STAGE COULD BE SET FOR STRONGER THUNDERSTORM. INITIALLY THE WIND FIELD IS WEAK...BUT A SPEED MAS IS FORECAST TO WORK THROUGH IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COLD FRONT AND A SPIKE ON INSTABILITY. SBCAPES COULD QUICKLY REACH 1000 J/KG OR BETTER...ESPECIALLY SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL REGION. THE WILD CARD WILL BE HOW MUCH SUNSHINE WILL TAKE PLACE. THE CANADIAN ASTRONOMICAL FORECAST MODEL INDICATED THERE WILL BE A REDUCTION IN CLOUD COVER. ONE OTHER POSSIBLE MITIGATING FACTOR...DEW POINTS MIGHT ACTUALLY DROP A LITTLE BEFORE THE COLD FRONT COMES THROUGH.  FOR NOW...WE DID INTRODUCE ENHANCED WORDING WITH THE CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS TOMORROW...SMALL HAIL AND GUSTY WINDS.  HIGH TEMPERATURES ON TUESDAY LOOK TO BE 75-80 MOST PLACES...A LITTLE COOLER ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN.  COOLER AIR ARRIVES BEHIND THE COLD FRONT FOR TUESDAY NIGHT ALONG WITH A GUSTY BREEZE. TEMPERATURES WILL BACK INTO THE 40S WITH A CLEARING TREND AFTER A RESIDUAL EVENING SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM.  WEDNESDAY WILL BE QUITE BRISK BY MID MAY STANDARDS WITH A MIX OF CLOUDS AND SUN. THERE COULD BE A PASSING SHOWER ACROSS THE ADIRONDACKS. OTHERWISE MAINLY DRY WITH NOTHING MORE THAN A SPRINKLE. HIGHS WILL BE ABOUT 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL...60-65 IN THE VALLEYS...50S ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN.  WEDNESDAY NIGHT WILL BE COOLER WITH LOWS IN THE 30S TO AROUND 40 IN THE IMMEDIATE CAPITAL REGION. THERE COULD BE FROST ISSUES...MAINLY IN THE OUTLYING AREAS. FOR NOW...WILL MENTION THE POSSIBILITY IN THE HWO.  THURSDAY LOOKS DECENT WITH PARTIAL SUNSHINE AS HIGH PRESSURE CRESTS TO OUR SOUTH. TEMPERATURES WILL BE A LITTLE CLOSER TO NORMAL...STILL RUNNING A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. THEY WILL TOP OUT AROUND 70 IN THE VALLEYS... 60S OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN.  THURSDAY NIGHT WILL BE PARTLY CLOUDY WITH LOWS 40S. A SECONDARY UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL SWING THROUGH FRIDAY BRINGING A FEW MORE CLOUDS AND PERHAPS SOME SPRINKLES OR A SHOWER TO THE ADIRONDACKS. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE SIMILAR THURSDAY.  
A WARM MUGGY AIR MASS WILL COMBINE WITH A NORTH TO SOUTH FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO TRIGGER A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE AREA INTO TONIGHT. A COLD FRONT WILL CROSS THE AREA BY EARLY AFTERNOON TUESDAY WITH ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE. MUCH COOLER WEATHER WILL FOLLOW BEHIND THE FRONT FOR THE MIDDLE AND LATER PART OF THE WEEK.  
LATEST WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWING A DEEP PLUME OF MOISTURE EXTENDING FROM THE GULF STATES AND SOUTHERN ATLANTIC NORTH ACROSS THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES THIS AFTERNOON. SURFACE DEW POINTS IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S AND DEEP LAYER PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AROUND 1.75 ARE WELL ABOVE NORMAL FOR MID-MAY. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE DEVELOPING WITHIN THIS PLUME OF MOISTURE AND THESE SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO BECOME INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ALONG A PRONOUNCED SURFACE CONVERGENCE ZONE EXTENDING FROM NEAR SYR TO BGM TO AVP INTO EARLY THIS EVENING. EAST OF THIS BOUNDARY EASTERLY FLOW HAS RESULTED IN TEMPERATURES FALLING INTO THE 60S AT MSV WHILE TO THE WEST TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE 80S WEST OF I-81.  LATEST SPC ANALYSIS INDICATES MLCAPE VALUES RANGING FROM 1000-1500 J/KG EAST OF I-81 IN THE WARM MOIST AIR. DEEP LAYER WIND SPEEDS ARE GENERALLY LESS THAN 20 KTS SO EXPECTING MOST STORMS TO BE OF THE PULSE VARIETY... HOWEVER THE LINEAR NATURE OF THE LOW- LEVEL CONVERGENCE COULD RESULT IN SOME POORLY ORGANIZED LINES OF STORMS AS WELL. SEVERAL OF OUR HIGH RESOLUTION CONVECTION-ALLOWING MODELS HAVE BEEN SHOWING COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS INCREASING INTO EARLY THIS EVENING. GIVEN THE MOIST ENVIRONMENT WITH WEAK DEEP LAYER WIND FLOW EXPECT THAT THE MAIN CONCERN WITH THESE SHOWERS WILL BE LOCALIZED HEAVY RAIN... ALTHOUGH AN ISOLATED DAMAGING WIND GUST OR LARGE HAIL REPORT CAN`T BE COMPLETELY RULED OUT GIVEN THE MODERATE INSTABILITY NOW OVER THE AREA. SHOWERS WILL DIMINISH LATER THIS EVENING BECOMING ISOLATED OVERNIGHT.  LATEST MODEL FORECASTS INDICATE COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE ACROSS CENTRAL NY AND NORTHEAST PA WILL BE LATE MORNING THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON. INSTABILITY WILL INCREASE LATE TUESDAY MORNING AND THE FRONT MAY TRIGGER A FEW SHOWERS OR STORMS THROUGH MID-AFTERNOON ESPECIALLY FOR AREAS EAST OF I-81. WIND AND SHEAR WILL BE STRONGER THAN TODAY AND MOISTURE WILL BE LESS... THEREFORE THE MAIN THREAT WITH ANY STORMS ON TUESDAY WILL BE GUSTY WINDS AND HAIL.  
THROUGH 18Z TUESDAY...VFR, WITH A PERIOD OF MVFR POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING AS SCT SHOWERS/THUNDER MOVE THROUGH THE REGION. SCT SHOWERS/THUNDER DEVELOPING ACROSS CENTRAL/WRN NY STATE THIS AFTERNOON WILL PROGRESS NORTH AND EAST INTO THIS EVENING, AND ACROSS MOST TERMINALS OVERNIGHT. BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS/THUNDER TO OCCUR AT KSLK/KPBG/KBTV 22-03Z, THEN MAINLY AREAS OF SHOWERS FROM 03-12Z AT MOST TERMINALS WITH PATCHY BR AND MVFR CIGS OVERNIGHT, MVFR BEING MOST LIKELY AT KMPV/KSLK. WINDS SOUTH TO SOUTHWESTERLY AND GUSTY THROUGH 00Z (SOUTHEAST AT KPBG/KRUT) BEFORE ABATING OVERNIGHT INTO TUESDAY.  OUTLOOK 18Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...  18Z TUESDAY THROUGH 00Z WEDNESDAY...BKN/OVC VFR/MVFR WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS/THUNDER, MAINLY KPBG/KBTV EASTWARD. BRIEF IFR POSSIBLE IN HEAVIER DOWNPOURS.  00Z WEDNESDAY ONWARD...MAINLY VFR WITH HIGH PRESSURE.  
AS OF 240 PM EDT MONDAY...LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM APPROACHING FROM THE WEST IS BRINGING SOUTHERLY WINDS DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. SOUTH WINDS ARE NEAR LAKE WIND ADVISORY NOW AT 10-25 KNOTS. SOUTH WINDS 15-25 KNOTS TO CONTINUE OVERNIGHT AND INTO TUESDAY, UNTIL THE COLD FRONT PASSES AROUND MID DAY TUESDAY AND WIND SHIFTS TO WEST. WINDS COULD INCREASE TO ADVISORY LEVEL AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AT 15-25 KNOTS. WAVES OF 1-3 FEET ARE EXPECTED FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.  
AS OF 459 PM EDT...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND FEW THUNDERSTORMS HAVE WORKED INTO HERKIMER COUNTY. AS THEY MOVE INTO SOMEWHAT MORE STABLE AIR DUE TO A MARINE LAYER...THEY HAVE SO FAR TENDED TO WEAKEN. HOWEVER...ONE WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO WARRANT ISSUING A BULLET NOW ON FOR POSSIBLE GUSTY WINDS TO 30 MPH AND BRIEF HEAVY RAINFALL.  TEMPERATURES APPROACHED 80 IN PORTIONS OF THE HUDSON VALLEY FROM THE CAPITAL REGION NORTHWARD...COOLER TO THE SOUTH AND EAST. THE STRATUS CLOUDS INITIALLY BEGAN TO DISSIPATE FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST...BUT THEN HAVE RETHICKEN AS MOISTURE INCREASES.  FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING...THESE SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE TO MIGRATE EASTWARD...AT LEAST FOR AWHILE UNTIL THE HEATING OF THE DAY IS LOST.  HOWEVER...ANOTHER SHORT WEAK WAVE MIGHT ENHANCE MORE SHOWERS OVERNIGHT ALONG THIS STALLED OUT BOUNDARY INTO EARLY TUESDAY.  WE WILL CONTINUE WITH LIKELY SHOWER COVERAGE TONIGHT ALONG WITH SLIGHT CHANCES OF THUNDERSTORMS.  TEMPERATURES TONIGHT WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE 50S.  
SHOWERS PROBABLY DIMINISH IN COVERAGE TUESDAY MORNING. HOWEVER...AS A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH SETS UP...THEN A COLD FRONT FOR LATE IN THE DAY...THE STAGE COULD BE SET FOR STRONGER THUNDERSTORM. INITIALLY THE WIND FIELD IS WEAK...BUT A SPEED MAS IS FORECAST TO WORK THROUGH IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COLD FRONT AND A SPIKE ON INSTABILITY. SBCAPES COULD QUICKLY REACH 1000 J/KG OR BETTER...ESPECIALLY SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL REGION. THE WILD CARD WILL BE HOW MUCH SUNSHINE WILL TAKE PLACE. THE CANADIAN ASTRONOMICAL FORECAST MODEL INDICATED THERE WILL BE A REDUCTION IN CLOUD COVER. ONE OTHER POSSIBLE MITIGATING FACTOR...DEW POINTS MIGHT ACTUALLY DROP A LITTLE BEFORE THE COLD FRONT COMES THROUGH.  FOR NOW...WE DID INTRODUCE ENHANCED WORDING WITH THE CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS TOMORROW...SMALL HAIL AND GUSTY WINDS.  HIGH TEMPERATURES ON TUESDAY LOOK TO BE 75-80 MOST PLACES...A LITTLE COOLER ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN.  COOLER AIR ARRIVES BEHIND THE COLD FRONT FOR TUESDAY NIGHT ALONG WITH A GUSTY BREEZE. TEMPERATURES WILL BACK INTO THE 40S WITH A CLEARING TREND AFTER A RESIDUAL EVENING SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM.  WEDNESDAY WILL BE QUITE BRISK BY MID MAY STANDARDS WITH A MIX OF CLOUDS AND SUN. THERE COULD BE A PASSING SHOWER ACROSS THE ADIRONDACKS. OTHERWISE MAINLY DRY WITH NOTHING MORE THAN A SPRINKLE. HIGHS WILL BE ABOUT 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL...60-65 IN THE VALLEYS...50S ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN.  WEDNESDAY NIGHT WILL BE COOLER WITH LOWS IN THE 30S TO AROUND 40 IN THE IMMEDIATE CAPITAL REGION. THERE COULD BE FROST ISSUES...MAINLY IN THE OUTLYING AREAS. FOR NOW...WILL MENTION THE POSSIBILITY IN THE HWO.  THURSDAY LOOKS DECENT WITH PARTIAL SUNSHINE AS HIGH PRESSURE CRESTS TO OUR SOUTH. TEMPERATURES WILL BE A LITTLE CLOSER TO NORMAL...STILL RUNNING A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. THEY WILL TOP OUT AROUND 70 IN THE VALLEYS... 60S OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN.  THURSDAY NIGHT WILL BE PARTLY CLOUDY WITH LOWS 40S. A SECONDARY UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL SWING THROUGH FRIDAY BRINGING A FEW MORE CLOUDS AND PERHAPS SOME SPRINKLES OR A SHOWER TO THE ADIRONDACKS. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE SIMILAR THURSDAY.   
THE MEMORIAL HOLIDAY  WEEKEND LOOKS TO START OUT FINE AS A LARGE HIGH PRESSURE INTO THE REGION. FRIDAY NIGHT WILL BE COOL WITH SOME POSSIBLE FROST IN THE COLDER OUTLYING AREAS. SATURDAY WILL BE MOSTLY SUNNY WITH HIGHS RECOVERING TO AROUND 70 IN THE VALLEYS...60S HIGHER TERRAIN.  SUNDAY SHOULD BE ANOTHER DECENT DAY AS HIGH PRESSURE ROLLS OFFSHORE. A SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL SEND TEMPERATURES WELL INTO THE 70S ACROSS OUR ENTIRE REGION.  BY MEMORIAL DAY ITSELF...MODEL GUIDANCE IS AT ODDS WITH WHAT WILL HAPPEN. THE 12Z OPERATIONAL EUROPEAN MODEL INDICATED ANOTHER BUBBLE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING BEHIND A WEAK BACKDOOR COLD FRONT WHICH WOULD KEEP US DRY WITH TEMPERATURES AGAIN MAINLY IN THE 70S (SOME 60S NORTH). THIS SOLUTION HAS ACTUALLY BEEN OFFERED IN SEVERAL CONSECUTIVE RUNS.  THE 12Z GFS HOWEVER...BRING MOISTURE AHEAD OF STRONGER COLD FRONT OUR WAY FOR THAT DAY...IMPLYING A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY THUNDERSTORMS. FOR NOW...HAVE COMPROMISED BETWEEN THE TWO SOLUTIONS AND WENT FOR 30 POPS FOR SHOWERS AND A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS.   
A BROAD DIFFUSE STATIONARY BOUNDARY FROM THE MID HUDSON VALLEY INTO WESTERN NEW ENGLAND IS A FOCUS FOR SOME LOW CLOUDS IN THE KPOU AREA...WHERE LIGHT SOUTHEAST WINDS OFF THE OCEAN ARE CONVERGING WITH SOUTH WINDS FURTHER INLAND.  THE LOW CLOUDS ARE VERY SLOWLY ERODING AND BY SUNSET THE LOW CLOUDS SHOULD DISSIPATE. HOWEVER...SCATTERED VARIABLE BROKEN CLOUDS AROUND 3500-5000 FEET ARE SPREADING EAST FROM CENTRAL NY AND WILL REACH KPOU/KALB/KGFL/KPSF LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE FORMING FROM CENTRAL NY INTO NE PA AND WILL ALSO GRADUALLY SPREAD EAST...AND INCREASE IN COVERAGE AS A COLD FRONT APPROACHES. MOST OF THE SHOWER ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO REACH THE TAF SITES AFTER MIDNIGHT BUT BEFORE SUNRISE... WHERE MVFR VISIBILITIES AND CEILINGS ARE INDICATED. COULD BE BORDERLINE IFR AT KALB...KPOU AND KGFL. KPSF HAS THE BEST CHANCE FOR A PERIOD OF IFR CEILINGS.  AFTER SUNRISE...COVERAGE OF THE SHOWERS SHOULD GRADUALLY DECREASE AS THE BULK OF THE SHOWER ACTIVITY TRANSLATES INTO NEW ENGLAND. INDICATING CEILINGS AND VISIBILITIES IMPROVING A LITTLE BY 15Z-16Z BUT CEILINGS AND VISIBILITIES STILL LOOKING TO BE MVFR...BUT CLOSER TO VFR THAN EARLIER IN THE MORNING. SCATTERED SHOWERS ARE STILL POSSIBLE SINCE THE COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO PASS THROUGH RIGHT AT THE END OF THE TAF PERIOD OR JUST AFTER...SO KEEPING VCSH THROUGH 18Z.  WINDS THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST AT AROUND 10 MPH...WITH SOME INTERMITTENT GUSTS ABOVE 15 KT AT KALB...KGFL AND KPSF. WINDS REMAIN SOUTH AT 6 KT OR LESS TONIGHT...THEN 10 KT OR LESS TOMORROW...TRENDING SOUTHWEST BY MIDDAY TOMORROW AT KPSF.  OUTLOOK...  TUESDAY NIGHT: MODERATE OPERATIONAL IMPACT. CHANCE OF SHRA. WEDNESDAY: LOW OPERATIONAL IMPACT. BREEZY. NO SIG WX. WEDNESDAY NIGHT: NO OPERATIONAL IMPACT. NO SIG WX. THURSDAY TO SATURDAY: NO OPERATIONAL IMPACT. NO SIG WX.  
NOTE...MOST OF OUR REGION HAS OFFICIALLY BEEN DECLARED "GREENED-UP" EXCLUDING THE ADIRONDACKS...NORTHERN TACONICS...SOUTHERN VERMONT AND THE CATSKILLS.  RH VALUES REMAINED ELEVATED TODAY DESPITE GUSTY SOUTHEAST WINDS.  TONIGHT SHOWERS ARE LIKELY ACROSS THE REGION...AND POSSIBLY A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WITH HEAVIER RAIN. IT IS A GOOD BET (BUT NOT CERTAINTY) THAT A QUARTER INCH OF RAINFALL WILL FALL ACROSS MOST AREAS.  TOMORROW...ANY LEFT-OVER SHOWERS WILL TAPER...BUT THEN AS A PRE- FRONTAL TROUGH SETS UP AND A COLD FRONT LATER ON IN THE DAY...MORE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED. SOME OF THE THUNDERSTORMS COULD CONTAIN GUSTY WINDS AND SMALL HAIL.  IT WILL BE SOMEWHAT BREEZY MOST OF THE NIGHT BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY PREVENT A PARTIAL RECOVERY IN MANY AREAS.  WEDNESDAY LOOKS RATHER WIND WITH RH VALUES DROPPING TO AROUND 30 PERCENT ACROSS MOST AREAS SOUTH OF THE ADIRONDACKS. A NORTHWEST WIND WILL GUST TO AROUND 30 MPH AT TIMES IN MANY LOCATIONS.  AS LONG AS WE GET THE RAIN WE SHOULD BE OKAY. HOWEVER...IF WE DO NOT GET SUBSTANTIAL RAINFALL...WE MIGHT HAVE TO CONSIDER FIRE WEATHER HEADLINES FOR THAT DAY.  IT WILL DRY AGAIN THURSDAY AFTERNOON WITH RH VALUES LIKELY NEAR 30 PERCENT...BUT SHOULD NOT BE QUITE AS BREEZY.  MAINLY DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED INTO THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND.   
NOTE...MOST OF OUR REGION HAS OFFICIALLY BEEN DECLARED "GREENED-UP" EXCLUDING THE ADIRONDACKS...NORTHERN TACONICS...SOUTHERN VERMONT AND THE CATSKILLS  MOISTURE WILL INCREASE THROUGH TUESDAY WITH SHOWERS BECOMING LIKELY TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING. THERE IS ALSO THE CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND TUESDAY AFTERNOON.  THE RH VALUES WILL REMAIN ABOVE 50 PERCENT TODAY...AND ABOVE 40 PERCENT ON TUESDAY. TONIGHT...RH VALUES WILL INCREASE TO 90 TO 100 PERCENT.  THE WINDS TODAY AND TONIGHT WILL BE SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH AT 5 TO 15 MPH. ON TUESDAY THE WINDS WILL BE SHIFTING TO THE WEST DURING THE AFTERNOON...WITH SPEEDS INCREASING TO 10 TO 15 MPH WITH GUSTS OF AROUND 25 MPH.  
THE FORECAST AREA REMAINS BETWEEN A RIDGE AXIS TO OUR EAST AND AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER THE UPPER GREAT LAKES...PRODUCING SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT ACROSS WESTERN AND CENTRAL NEW YORK. PW VALUES ON THE 12Z KBUF SOUNDING WERE AROUND 1.5 INCHES AND CURRENT MESOANALYSIS SUGGEST MOISTURE ADVECTION HAS PUSHED THESE VALUES TO NEAR 1.7 INCHES. AN AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ASSOCIATED WITH A PRE- FRONTAL TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH THROUGH CENTRAL NEW YORK THROUGH EARLY EVENING. MEANWHILE ANOTHER AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING OVER OH AND NW PA ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK SHORTWAVE IN THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW. AS THIS WAVE RIDES UP AND AROUND THE RIDGE AXIS THIS EVENING...THESE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL EVOLVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER AND INTO THE FINGER LAKES REGION. MEAN STORM MOTION BASED ON CLOUD LAYER WINDS SUGGEST EAST- NORTHEAST MOVING STORMS AROUND 20 KNOTS...WHICH IS WHAT ONGOING STORMS SEEM TO BE OBEYING. GIVEN THIS FORWARD MOTION...DESPITE NEAR- RECORD PW VALUES...WIDESPREAD INTENSE RAINFALL IS NOT EXPECTED. HOWEVER...GIVEN BACK-BUILDING STORM VECTORS ARE NEAR-STATIONARY...IF ANY STORMS DO BEGIN TO BACK-BUILD LATER THIS EVENING...THIS COULD RESULT IN LOCALIZED FLOODING FROM VERY HEAVY RAINFALL.  OVERNIGHT...A COLD FRONT WILL CROSS THE AREA AS THE SURFACE LOW TRACKS ACROSS SOUTHERN ONTARIO. WITH DRIER AIR MOVING INTO WESTERN NEW YORK...ANY REMAINING SHOWER ACTIVITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE FINGER LAKES REGION. OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL NOT FALL QUICKLY WITH REMAIN LOW-LEVEL CLOUD COVER HANGING AROUND THROUGH THE NIGHT. BY TUESDAY CLEARING WILL WORK ACROSS THE AREA FROM WEST TO EAST..AS WILL COOLER 850MB TEMPS...DROPPING INTO THE +2 TO +4 C RANGE. THUS TEMPERATURES ACROSS WESTERN NY WILL RECOVER INTO THE LOW-MID 60S TUESDAY MORNING...BEFORE DROPPING OFF THROUGH THE 50S BY LATE TUESDAY AFTERNOON. FARTHER EAST ACROSS THE FINGER LAKES REGION...TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECOVER A LITTLE LONGER BEFORE THE COOLER AIR ARRIVES...AND THUS SOME LOW 70S ARE LIKELY THERE BEFORE COOLING THROUGH THE LATE AFTERNOON. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ANY LINGERING EARLY DAY SHOWERS IN THE NORTH COUNTRY...TUESDAY SHOULD BE DRY AND TURNING SUNNY FOR MOST AREAS.  
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE ACROSS AREAS SOUTH AND EAST OF A LINE FROM KBUF TO KROC TO KART THROUGH TONIGHT. THIS KEEP VFR CONDITIONS PREVAILING AT MOST TAF SITES. KJHW HAS THE BEST CHANCE OF SEEING MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS IN A HEAVIER SHOWER/THUNDERSTORM THROUGH THIS EVENING.  TONIGHT...EXPECT AREAS OF FOG TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER AND AND FINGER LAKES REGION...WHERE HEAVIER PRECIPITATION FALLS DURING THE DAY TODAY...THIS INCLUDES KJHW.    OUTLOOK... TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...VFR.  
WARM AIR ADVECTION PRECIPITATION WILL CONTINUE THIS AFTERNOON AND INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TUESDAY WITH COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE. FROM TUESDAY NIGHT ONWARD THE WEATHER WILL BE FAIRLY QUIET AND COOL.  
AS OF 348 PM EDT MONDAY...PRE FRONTAL TROUGH CROSSES OUR FORECAST AREA TONIGHT BRINGING A LINE OF SHOWERS WITH ISOLATED THUNDER ACROSS. BRIEF HEAVY DOWNPOURS ARE POSSIBLE WITH PWATS OVER 1.75 INCHES. STORMS THAT DO FORM SHOULD MOVE QUICKLY THOUGH...THEREFORE NO MAJOR HYDRO CONCERNS. SHOWERS SHOULD CLEAR OUR AREA TO THE EAST BY 12Z. OVERNIGHT MIN TEMPS WILL BE VERY MILD...NEAR SIXTY DEGREES WHICH IS ABOUT 15 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL FOR MID MAY.  
A STATIONARY FRONT SOUTHWEST OF THE REGION LIFTS NORTH AS A WARM FRONT TONIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING...AND THEN A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE IS THEN IN CONTROL THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A DRY COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE ON FRIDAY.  
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC MOVES TO THE EAST THIS EVENING. THIS WILL ALLOW THE STATIONARY FRONT SOUTHWEST OF THE AREA TO LIFT NORTHEAST AS A WARM FRONT LATE TONIGHT.  AS THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH...EXPECT SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A FEW ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP. THE BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL BE ACROSS NJ AND THE LOWER HUDSON VALLEY. AS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE INCREASES...AREAS OF FOG WILL DEVELOP ACROSS LONG ISLAND...SOUTHERN CT...AND COASTAL AREAS...AND PATCHY FOG WILL DEVELOP ELSEWHERE...AND FOG WILL PERSIST THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. LOWS TONIGHT WILL GENERALLY DROP INTO THE 50S.  
THE WARM FRONT LIFTS NORTH OF THE REGION EARLY TUESDAY MORNING. A COLD FRONT THEN APPROACHES FROM THE WEST DURING THE DAY TUESDAY. A SOUTHERLY FLOW OUT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT WILL USHER IN A WARMER AND MILDER AIRMASS INTO THE REGION. TEMPERATURES ON TUESDAY WILL TOP OFF IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S ACROSS LONG ISLAND AND SE CT...AND IN THE MIDDLE TO UPPER 70S ACROSS NYC...INTERIOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CT...AND IN THE UPPER 70S TO NEAR 80 ACROSS NE NJ AND THE LOWER HUDSON VALLEY.  WITH A WARM AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS ACROSS THE REGION ON TUESDAY... SHOWERS WILL BE LIKELY WITH SCATTERED TSTMS DURING THE DAY AND INTO THE EVENING AS THE COLD FRONT WORKS ITS WAY ACROSS THE REGION. CHANCES FOR CONVECTION WILL LOWER IN THE EVENING...AND THEN SHOWERS WILL TAPER OFF AFTER MIDNIGHT TUESDAY NIGHT. LOWS WILL DROP INTO THE LOW TO MID 50S.  
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA FROM NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND THROUGH THIS EVENING. A WARM FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TERMINALS LATE TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING.  MVFR CONTINUES AT MOST TERMINALS. CIGS DROP TO IFR AFTER SUNSET...FIRST AT KJFK AND KISP. LIFR/IFR CONDS ARE THEN EXPECTED OVERNIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING IN LOW CLOUDS...FOG...AND -SHRA.  NE-E WINDS 10-15 KT CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY...THEN BECOME SE-ESE AT 5-10 KT TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING.  AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM CANNOT BE RULED OUT TUESDAY MORNING.

AFTERNOON. VFR AT NIGHT. CHANCE SHRA/TSRA IN THE EVE. 
SEAS ARE BETWEEN 4 AND 5 FT THIS AFTERNOON AND ARE EXPECTED TO FALL BELOW 4 FT THIS EVENING. AT THIS TIME...WILL NOT ISSUE A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY SINCE THIS SHOULD BE SHORT LIVED. WILL MONITOR THROUGH THE EVENING. OTHERWISE...EXPECT FOG TO RE-DEVELOP TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE WATERS LATE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...AND THEN A FEW GUSTS TO 20 KT ARE LIKELY TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE GRADIENT TIGHTENS BEHIND THE DEPARTING COLD FRONT.  SEAS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW 5 FT THROUGH THE REST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. THERE COULD BE HOWEVER BE FREQUENT GUSTS TO SCA CRITERIA WEDNESDAY BEHIND A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE...AND AGAIN ON FRIDAY BEHIND A COLD FRONT.  
COMPLEX DBL FNT SYSTEM WILL PUSHES SHWRS AND TRWS INTO THE REGION THIS AFTN AND TNGT. THIS AFTN...HTG AND APRCHG WRM FNT HAS ALREADY GENERATED TSTMS. THIS WILL BRING BRIEF MVFR CONDS TO ANY STATION IN THE PATH OF THE STORMS. TNGT...INCRSD LL MOISTURE WILL GENERATE MORE WIDESPREAD MVFR CIGS AND VSBYS ALONG WITH OCNL SHWRS. CRNT TIMING ON THE FNT WILL GIVE A PASSAGE THRU THE AREA EARLY TUE. LOOKS LIKE A RETURN TO VFR ALL STATIONS IS LIKELY BEFORE THE END OF THE TAF PD.  
SOUTH WINDS WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE REGION AHEAD OF A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM APPROACHING FROM THE WEST. TEMPERATURES WILL BE QUITE WARM IN NORTHERN NEW YORK AND THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY, WHILE EASTERN VERMONT WILL FEEL THE EFFECTS OF COOLER AIR FROM THE GULF OF MAINE. CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL INCREASE FROM WEST TO EAST LATE TODAY AND OVERNIGHT AS THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DRAWS NEAR. A COLD FRONT ON TUESDAY WILL BRING MORE CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS, FOLLOWED BY COOLER TEMPERATURES FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE WEEK.  
AS OF 1251 PM EDT MONDAY...MAINLY JUST CHANGES TO REFLECT CURRENT OBSERVATIONS THIS AFTERNOON. GOING FORECAST WAS ALREADY IN GOOD SHAPE. PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS FOLLOW.  MAIN CHANGE WITH THIS UPDATE WAS TO DELINEATE CLOUDS IN EASTERN VERMONT ASSOCIATED WITH BACK DOOR COLD FRONT. SUNRISE HAS REVEALED SOLID LOW OVERCAST ON VISIBLE SATELLITE OVER MUCH OF EASTERN VERMONT. PREVIOUS FORECAST HAD GENERAL OUTLINE BUT WAY LOW ON TOTAL SKY COVER IN THAT AREA. NO MODEL GUIDANCE IS PICKING UP ON THE CLOUDS SO USED THE 30 PERCENT SKY COVER AREA AND BUMPED IT UP TO OVERCAST THROUGH LATE MORNING, THEN TAPERED DOWN THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON. QUITE A BIT OF VARIABILITY IN TEMPERATURES TODAY WITH SOUTH WINDS BRINGING WARM AIR TO NORTHERN NEW YORK AND CHAMPLAIN VALLEY, WHILE BACK DOOR FRONT KEEPS EASTERN VERMONT COOLER WITH MORE CLOUDS.  SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER MAINE WILL KEEP EASTERLY FLOW OFF THE GULF OF MAINE ACROSS NH INTO EASTERN VERMONT. SURFACE OBS SHOWING EXTENT OF MOIST MARINE LAYER EVIDENT IN LOW OVERCAST BELOW 1500 FT INTO EASTERN VT. ELSEWHERE NEARLY CALM WINDS AND HIGH THIN CLOUDS WITH PATCHES OF LIGHT FOG. SOUTHERLY FLOW TO DEVELOP TODAY IN CHAMPLAIN VALLEY AND NORTHERN NY IN ADVANCE OF APPROACHING SURFACE LOW. UPPER RIDGE CRESTS OVER REGION DURING THE DAY AND SHIFTS EAST BY THE END OF THE PERIOD ALLOWING FOR CHANCE FOR SHOWERS IN ST. LAWRENCE COUNTY.  TEMPS IN ST. LAWRENCE VALLEY TO REACH THE MID 80S...WITH 70S ELSEWHERE AND EASTERN VERMONT ONLY IN THE 60S. MARINE LAYER IS SHALLOW AND DO NOT EXPECT IT TO BECOME BLOCKED BY THE GREEN MOUNTAINS AND REMAIN IN EASTERN VT. SOUTHERLY FLOW UP THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY WILL ALSO KEEP ANY MARINE INVERSION MIXED OUT AS WELL. WINDS TO INCREASE TO 15 TO 25 KNOTS.  
AS OF 415 AM EDT MONDAY...500 MB RIDGE SHIFTS EAST EARLY IN THE PERIOD WITH INITIAL SHORTWAVE TROUGH PUSHING INTO THE RIDGE. DEEPER UPPER LOW MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES TONIGHT AND WILL SUPPRESS RIDGE TO THE EAST AND SOUTH LATER IN THIS PERIOD. BAND OF SHOWERS WITH SOME THUNDER WILL MOVE WEST TO EAST MAINLY OVERNIGHT TONIGHT ALONG THE INITIAL SHORTWAVE TROUGH, WITH LIKELY POPS TRANSLATING WEST TO EAST. SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL POOL VERY MOIST AIR WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER OVER 1.5 INCHES BASED ON NAM BUFKIT PLOT, WHICH GETS US ABOVE THE 90TH PERCENTILE FOR THE DAY. BRIEF HEAVY DOWNPOURS ARE POSSIBLE, BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS RAIN WILL BE MOVING THROUGH RELATIVELY QUICKLY AND HYDRO ISSUES ARE NOT A CONCERN.  FOR TUESDAY THE COLD FRONT MAKES ITS PUSH THROUGH, CROSSING NORTHERN NEW YORK IN THE MORNING, CHAMPLAIN VALLEY MIDDAY, AND VERMONT IN THE AFTERNOON. HIGH RESOLUTION MODELS NOT INDICATING MUCH PRECIP WITH THE FRONT IN THE MORNING AS CAPE DOES NOT YET BUILD, BUT BETTER CHANCES FOR RAIN SHOWERS AND SOME THUNDER FROM MIDDAY ONWARD COINCIDING WITH SURFACE HEATING. TEMPERATURES TUESDAY STILL WARM IN THE 70S. AFTER THE FRONT PASSES TEMPERATURES QUITE A BIT COOLER TUESDAY NIGHT, WITH FROST A POSSIBILITY IN THE ADIRONDACKS. LOW CHANCE POPS CONTINUE IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN THROUGH WEDNESDAY. TRAILING 500 MB TROUGH PASSES THROUGH THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY, AND WEST TO NORTHWEST UPSLOPE FLOW COMBINED WITH DESTABILIZATION OF COLD POOL ALOFT AND RESIDUAL LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL GENERATE SCATTERED TERRAIN DRIVEN SHOWERS. TEMPS WEDNESDAY IN THE 50S AND 60S.  
AS OF 415 AM EDT MONDAY...LITTLE CHANGE WITH REGARDS TO THE EXTENDED FORECAST PERIOD... WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...WITH THE MAIN THEME OF DRY WEATHER AND BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES. THE FLOW ALOFT THROUGH MUCH OF THE PERIOD WILL BE FROM THE NORTHWEST...HENCE THE REASON FOR THE DRIER AND COOLER WEATHER. HIGHS WILL GENERALLY BE IN THE 60S WITH LOWS IN THE 30S AND 40S...WHICH IS A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. THE ONE TIME PERIOD THAT STANDS OUT IS FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVES DOWN FROM CANADA ON FRIDAY AND BRINGS A CHANCE OF SHOWERS TO THE AREA. ANOTHER SURGE OF COLDER AIR COMES IN BEHIND THAT FEATURE FRIDAY NIGHT AND LOWS WILL BE IN THE 20S AND 30S...WHICH WILL HAVE TO BE MONITORED FOR POTENTIAL FROST/FREEZE CONDITIONS.  
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS DOWN FROM THE CANADIAN MARITIMES AND ALONG THE NEW ENGLAND COAST TODAY. A WARM FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE WEST TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING...AND THEN A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE IS THEN IN CONTROL THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A DRY COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE ON FRIDAY.  
STRATUS REMAINS OVER MUCH OF THE REGION...EXCEPT ACROSS EASTERN CT...WHERE SOME CLEARING HAS OCCURRED. TEMPERATURES THERE HAVE CLIMBED INTO THE LOWER 70S. ELSEWHERE...EXPECT HIGHS ONLY IN THE UPPER 50S AND LOWER TO MIDDLE 60S. TEMPERATURES MAY JUMP A FEW DEGREES IF ANY BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS DEVELOP. OTHERWISE...EXPECT A MOSTLY DRY DAY.  
HIGH PRES OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC MOVES TO THE EAST THIS EVENING AS THE STATIONARY FRONT SOUTH OF THE AREA LIFTS TO THE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT LATE TONIGHT.  WEAK SHORTWAVE APPROACHES FROM THE WEST TONIGHT...AND WITH INCREASING LOW LEVEL INSTABILITY FROM WEST TO EAST...WILL BE A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS WITH ISOLATED TSTMS FOR THE WESTERN THIRD OF THE CWA THIS EVENING...AND THEN CHANCES FOR SHOWERS INCREASE ACROSS THE REGION LATE TONIGHT AS THE WARM FRONT LIFTS TO THE NORTH. WITH INCREASING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...AREAS OF FOG WILL DEVELOP ACROSS LONG ISLAND...SOUTHERN CT...AND COASTAL AREAS...AND PATCHY FOG WILL DEVELOP ELSEWHERE...AND FOG WILL PERSIST THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. LOWS TONIGHT WILL GENERALLY DROP INTO THE LOW TO MID 50S.  COLD FRONT THEN APPROACHES FROM THE WEST DURING THE DAY TUESDAY. SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL USHER A WARMER AND MILDER AIRMASS INTO THE REGION. TEMPS ON TUESDAY WILL TOP OFF IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S ACROSS LONG ISLAND AND SE CT...AND IN THE LOW TO MID 70S ACROSS NYC...INTERIOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CT...AND IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S ACROSS NE NJ AND THE LOWER HUDSON VALLEY.  WITH A WARM AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS ACROSS THE REGION ON TUESDAY... SHOWERS WILL BE LIKELY WITH SCATTERED TSTMS DURING THE DAY AND INTO THE EVENING AS THE COLD FRONT WORKS ITS WAY ACROSS THE REGION. CHANCES FOR CONVECTION WILL LOWER IN THE EVENING...AND THEN SHOWERS WILL TAPER OFF BY MIDNIGHT TUESDAY NIGHT. LOWS WILL DROP INTO THE LOW TO MID 50S.  
THERE IS GOOD AGREEMENT IN THE GLOBAL MODELS WITH LARGELY CONFLUENT FLOW EAST OF THE MS RIVER VALLEY. THIS WILL ALLOW HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS TO BUILD EAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND TO JUST OFFSHORE THE EAST COAST NEXT SUN. THIS WILL ALSO MEAN A DRY FORECAST WITH TEMPS NEARLY SEASONABLE THROUGH THE PERIOD.  A SHORT WAVE OVER THE MIDWEST DAMPENS AS IT MOVES OUT INTO THE TN AND OH VALLEY WED INTO THU. THE NAM WRF IS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE SOLUTION AS IT BRING IN CLOUDS AND LIGHT RAIN TO THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. THE GFS AND ECMWF ARE SUPPRESSED SOUTH WITH THE SYSTEM...BUT DO BRING IN SOME MID LEVEL CLOUDS ON THU. PREFERRED TO STAY DRY AT THIS TIME. THEREAFTER...A REINFORCING COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH LATE FRI.  
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA FROM NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND TODAY. A WARM FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TERMINALS LATE TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING.  CONDITIONS HAVE IMPROVED SINCE THIS MORNING WITH MVFR NOW AT MOST TERMINALS. CIGS DROP TO IFR AFTER SUNSET...FIRST AT KJFK AND KISP. LIFR/IFR CONDS ARE THEN EXPECTED OVERNIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING IN LOW CLOUDS...FOG...AND -SHRA.  NE-E WINDS 10-15 KT CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY...THEN BECOME SE-ESE AT 5-10 KT TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING.  AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM CANNOT BE RULED OUT TUESDAY MORNING.

A WEAK PRES GRADIENT WILL KEEP CONDS BELOW SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDS THROUGH TUESDAY. EXPECT FOG TO RE-DEVELOP TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE WATERS LATE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...AND THEN A FEW GUSTS TO 20 KT ARE LIKELY TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE GRADIENT TIGHTENS BEHIND THE DEPARTING COLD FRONT.  SUB-SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED WED THROUGH FRI WITH A RELATIVELY LIGHT FLOW PERSISTING ACROSS THE AREA. NW GUSTS MAY REACH AROUND 20 KT WED INTO WED NIGHT BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. OFFSHORE FLOW WILL KEEP OCEAN SEAS BELOW 5 FT.  
A WARM MUGGY AIR MASS WILL BE OVER THE REGION INTO TUESDAY. THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF A WARM FRONTAL PASSAGE TODAY...THEN A COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE ON TUESDAY...WILL BRING THE LIKELIHOOD OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. DRIER COOLER WEATHER IS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW ON WEDNESDAY.  
UPDATED AT 11 AM... LATEST SPC ANALYSIS SHOWING SBCAPE VALUES RISING TO ABOVE 1000 J/KG ACROSS CENTRAL NY LATE THIS MORNING WITH MLCAPE VALES FROM 500-1000 J/KG. TROUGH OVER WESTERN NY AND NW PA IS MOVING EAST WITH NO CONVECTION AS OF YET... HOWEVER WITH INCREASING DESTABILIZATION EXPECTED DOWNSTREAM OF THIS FEATURE EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE AREA BY 2 OR 3 PM. SFC DEW POINTS ARE IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S AND PWAT VALUES ARE FORECAST TO INCREASE TO BETWEEN 1.5 AND 1.75 INCHES LATER THIS AFTERNOON WHICH IS QUITE ANOMALOUS FOR MAY. WINDS FROM 850-500 WILL BE RATHER LIGHT... MAINLY 20 KTS OR LESS... WITH A WEAK LOW-LEVEL SWRLY JET FROM 20-25 KTS DEVELOPING LATE THIS AFTERNOON. THESE FACTORS ALL INDICATE THAT THERE WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME LOCALIZED HEAVY RAIN WITH SOME OF THE STORMS THAT DEVELOP LATER TODAY. WILL BE WATCHING THIS EVOLUTION CLOSELY DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS. PREVIOUS DISCUSSION IS BELOW.    430 AM MON UPDATE... UNSETTLED WX IS STILL EXPECTED THIS PD.  A NEARLY STATIONARY FRNTL BNDRY NEAR THE PA/NY BORDER EARLY THIS MRNG...WILL BEGIN TO MOVE SLOWLY NEWD AS A WARM FRNT TDY. AS OUR RESIDENT AMS DESTABILIZES THIS AFTN (SPCLY FOR AREAS NEAR AND W OF THE I-81 CORRIDOR...WHICH ARE MOST LIKELY TO BREAK INTO THE WARM SECTOR)...AND HGT FALLS ALOFT/IMPROVING UPR JET DYNAMICS BEGIN TO IMPINGE ON THE RGN LTR IN THE DAY...SHWRS/TSTMS SHOULD INCREASE IN COVERAGE BY EARLY TO MID-AFTN. THE LIKELIHOOD OF SHWRS/TSTMS SHOULD THEN CONTINUE WELL INTO THIS EVE.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE POTENTIAL FOR LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL THIS AFTN AND EVE...AS SIGNALS HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN THERE IN THE MODELS FOR THE LAST SVRL CYCLES. THESE INGREDIENTS INCLUDE DEEP MOISTURE (PWAT VALUES NEAR 1.75" AND WARM CLOUD DEPTHS OF 10-12K FEET)...TALL NARROW INSTABILITY PROFILES TO INCREASE PARCEL RESIDENCE TIMES IN THE WARM CLOUD LYR...AND THE PSBLTY FOR SLOW MOVING/TRAINING CELLS...OWING TO A FAIRLY LGT AND UNIDIRECTIONAL WIND PATN UP THROUGH THE MID-LYRS OF THE ATMOSPHERE. THUS...WE`VE MENTIONED HEAVY DOWNPOURS IN THE GRIDS...AND HAVE CONTINUED THE MENTION OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL IN THE HWO. DUE TO THE LIKELY SMALL-SCALE/ISOLD NATURE OF ANY EXCESSIVE RAINFALL...PLUS LONG- TERM DRY ANTECEDENT CONDS...AND FULL GREEN-UP...IT`S WAY TOO PREMATURE/UNCERTAIN TO CONSIDER ANY FLOOD WATCHES ATTM.  AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS...THE PROXIMITY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED WARM FRNTL BNDRY ACRS THE RGN...SHOULD LEAD TO A FAIR TEMP GRADIENT THIS AFTN (HIGHS RANGING FROM NEAR 70 OVER PTNS OF THE CATSKILLS...TO THE MID 80S IN THE FINGER LAKES RGN).  ON TUE...THE MAIN SFC COLD FRNT IS STILL EXPECTED TO CHARGE THROUGH CNY/NE PA FROM NW TO SE...MOST LIKELY DURG THE AFTN HRS. BY THIS TIME...DRIER AIR ALOFT AND LESSENING JET DYNAMICS...SHOULD ONLY LEAD TO SCTD CONVECTIVE COVERAGE ALG AND JUST PRECEDING THIS FRNT. IT DOES APPEAR...HOWEVER...THAT THERE WILL BE A SOMEWHAT GREATER WIND/HAIL THREAT...SPCLY FOR OUR ERN ZNS...AS A RESULT OF THE JUST ALLUDED TO DRIER AIR IN THE MID-LVLS...AND ALSO STGR DEEP-LYRD SHEAR.  ONCE THE FRNT CLEARS THE FA...MUCH COOLER AIR SHOULD QUICKLY ADVECT IN STARTING TUE EVE.  
400 AM EDT UPDATE... BEHIND THE FRONT...SHOWERS WILL QUICKLY DIMINISH TUESDAY NIGHT. A BRIEF SPRINKLE COULD STILL SKIM FAR NORTHERN ZONES WEDNESDAY MORNING...OTHERWISE DRY DURING THE SHORT TERM PERIOD. STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL OCCUR TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...WITH PEAK DAYTIME GUSTS OF 20-25 MPH. HIGHS WILL RANGE FROM ONLY MID- UPPER 50S IN CENTRAL NY...TO UPPER 50S- LOW 60S IN NORTHEAST PA. SURFACE RIDGE...EXTENDING EAST FROM SPRAWLING CENTRAL PLAINS HIGH PRESSURE...WILL VISIT WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHICH WILL SLACKEN WINDS AND RESULT IN SOME RADIATIONAL COOLING. NOT AN IDEAL RADIATIONAL COOLING SET UP...GIVEN THAT HIGH PRESSURE WILL NOT PASS DIRECTLY OVERHEAD /STILL SOME GRADIENT WIND JUST OFF THE SURFACE/...AND HIGH THIN CLOUDS MAY BE SPREADING INTO THE AREA BY THURSDAY MORNING FROM WEAK WAVE ALOFT. STILL LOOKING FOR LOWS OF MAINLY UPPER 30S-LOW 40S WEDNESDAY NIGHT...SOME OF OUR TYPICALLY COLDEST DRAINAGE SPOTS COULD HAVE PATCHY FROST AND MID 30S.  
QUIET PD FOR THE XTNDD. SCNDRY FNT APRCHS THE AREA ON FRI AND MGT GENERATE A FEW SHWRS OVER THE NRN AREAS WITH PEAK HTG. HGTS BLDS AGAIN AS SFC HIPRES BLDS IN FOR THE WEEKEND SO XPCT DRY WEATHER INTO SUNDAY. WITH THE TROFINESS ALOFT IN THE PD...TEMPS WILL BE A BIT COOLER THAN NRML DESPITE THE DAYTIME SUN.  
COMPLEX DBL FNT SYSTEM WILL PUSHES SHWRS AND TRWS INTO THE REGION THIS AFTN AND TNGT. THIS AFTN...HTG AND APRCHG WRM FNT HAS ALREADY GENERATED TSTMS. THIS WILL BRING BRIEF MVFR CONDS TO ANY STATION IN THE PATH OF THE STORMS. TNGT...INCRSD LL MOISTURE WILL GENERATE MORE WIDESPREAD MVFR CIGS AND VSBYS ALONG WITH OCNL SHWRS. CRNT TIMING ON THE FNT WILL GIVE A PASSAGE THRU THE AREA EARLY TUE. LOOKS LIKE A RETURN TO VFR ALL STATIONS IS LIKELY BEFORE THE END OF THE TAF PD.  
A WARM AND HUMID AIR MASS WILL REMAIN OVER THE REGION WITH A PERIOD OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS PUSHING ACROSS WESTERN AND CENTRAL NEW YORK TODAY AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT. SOME OF THESE THUNDERSTORMS MAY BRING LOCALIZED HEAVY RAIN. THE FRONT WILL CROSS EARLY TUESDAY THEN A COOLER AND DRIER AIRMASS WILL ARRIVE BEHIND THE FRONT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK.  
THE FORECAST AREA LIES BENEATH AN AMPLIFIED 500MB RIDGE WITH STACKED SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE MINNESOTA ARROWHEAD CONTINUING TO SPREAD WARM AND MOIST AIR NORTH ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. AT 12Z...KBUF SOUNDING INDICATED PW VALUES NEAR 1.5 INCHES...AND WITH CONTINUED MOISTURE ADVECTION FORECAST SOUNDINGS PUSH PW VALUES TO AROUND 1.7 INCHES BY THIS AFTERNOON.  FORCING FOR CONVECTION TODAY WILL COME FROM A FEW DISORGANIZED SOURCES: 1/ A SURFACE TROUGH IS ANALYZED ROUGHLY FROM NORTHERN MI SOUTHEAST TO NEAR KERI...2/FROM A WEAK SHORTWAVE LIFTING OUT OF THE MID-WEST AND OVER THE RIDGE THIS AFTERNOON...AND 3/ INLAND MOVING LAKE BREEZE BOUNDARIES FROM LAKE ERIE/LAKE ONTARIO. WITH PLENTY OF MOISTURE AND UNSTABLE LAPSE RATES ALOFT...GETTING CONVECTION TO INITIATE THIS AFTERNOON SHOULDNT BE A PROBLEM DESPITE VIS SATELLITE DEPICTING A LAYER OF STRATUS ACROSS WESTERN NY THIS MORNING.  BY EARLY AFTERNOON FORECAST CAPE VALUES OF 1-2K J/KG WILL FEED MORE NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING FROM THE SOUTHERN TIER ACROSS THE GENESEE VALLEY AND FINGER LAKES. A STABLE SOUTHWEST FLOW OFF LAKE ERIE SHOULD KEEP MUCH OF THE NIAGARA FRONTIER /INCLUDING BUFFALO AND NIAGARA FALLS/ PROTECTED FROM THE HEAVIER STORMS BUT LAKE BREEZES COULD TRIGGER ADDITIONAL CELLS TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF BUFFALO. BULK SHEAR THIS AFTERNOON IS FORECAST ONLY AROUND 15 KTS SO TOO WEAK TO SUPPORT ANY SIGNIFICANT WIND/HAIL THREAT. INSTEAD...THE MAIN THREAT WILL BE VERY HEAVY RAINFALL FROM THE GENESEE VALLEY EAST ACROSS THE FINGER LAKES. WITH NEAR-RECORD PW VALUES...NEAR- STATIONARY UPSTREAM PROPAGATION VECTORS...TRAINING OF THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE SAME AREAS IS A GOOD POSSIBILITY...AND COULD LEAD TO LOCALIZED VERY HEAVY RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.  TONIGHT...THE SURFACE LOW WILL SHIFT NORTH OF THE GREAT LAKES TO SOUTHERN QUEBEC. NEAR-TERM MODELS INDICATE THE MAJORITY OF REMAINING CONVECTION WILL BE LIMITED FROM THE FINGER LAKES EASTWARD ACROSS CENTRAL AND EASTERN NEW YORK. WESTERN NEW YORK WILL LARGELY REMAIN DRY. THE COLD FRONT WILL CROSS WNY LATE TONIGHT AND IS FORECAST TO BE NEAR THE FINGER LAKES BY 12Z TUESDAY WITH SKY COVER THINNING FROM WEST TO EAST. THE OVERNIGHT TIMING OF THE FRONT SHOULD LIMIT A SECOND ROUND OF SHOWER/TSTM ACTIVITY.  TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL AGAIN RISE ABOVE NORMAL WITHIN A HUMID AIRMASS. 850MB TEMPS OF NEAR +15C WILL SUPPORT SURFACE HIGH TEMPS RANGING FROM THE UPPER 70S TO MID 80S. THE U70S TEMPS WILL ONLY BE LIMITED BY EARLIER START TO CONVECTION WHILE MORE HEATING ACROSS FINGER LAKES AND NORTH COUNTRY WILL HELP BOOST TEMPS TO THE M80S.  
A STRONG COLD FRONT WILL CROSS THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAY ON TUESDAY. WHILE THE BULK OF THE PRECIPITATION WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AND ALREADY WELL TO THE EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA OVER THE ADIRONDACKS/GREEN MOUNTAINS BY TUESDAY MORNING...A FEW SHOWERS WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG/JUST AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT...PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE NORTH COUNTRY WHERE THE APPROACH OF THE COLD FRONT WILL COINCIDE WITH THE AFTERNOON DIURNAL HEATING MAXIMUM.  OTHERWISE...LOOK FOR BREEZY CONDITIONS WITH FALLING TEMPERATURES BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. A PERIOD OF POST-FRONTAL SUBSIDENCE AND SUNSHINE WILL GIVE WAY TO INCREASING CLOUDS LATER IN THE DAY AND INTO THE EVENING AS THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH. TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO FALL INTO THE 40S TUESDAY NIGHT...WITH HIGHER ELEVATIONS DIPPING JUST BELOW THE 40 DEGREE MARK AS THE CORE OF THE COLD AIR ALOFT MOVES ACROSS THE REGION. WITH 850MB TEMPS FALLING BELOW -2C...WE MAY EVEN SEE A DECENT AMOUNT OF LAKE-ENHANCED CLOUD COVER TUESDAY NIGHT AND INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. THIS COLD AIR ALOFT AND THE ASSOCIATED CLOUD COVER WILL AID IN MAKING WEDNESDAY THE COLDEST DAY OF THIS WEEK WITH HIGHS ONLY TOPPING OUT IN THE LOW TO MID 50S.  BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON WE SHOULD SEE AN INCREASE IN SUNSHINE ONCE MORE AS THE COLDEST AIR ALOFT IS QUICKLY SHUNTED OFF TO THE EAST AS A FLATTER AND FASTER PATTERN TAKES SHAPE IN THE UPPER LEVELS AND SURFACE RIDING BEGINS TO CREEP IN ACROSS THE AREA FROM THE UPPER MIDWEST. A FAST-MOVING SHORTWAVE SHOULD BRING SOME CLOUD COVER TO THE SOUTHERN TIER  WEDNESDAY NIGHT BUT HAVE LITTLE OTHER IMPACT OWING TO A DEARTH OF MOISTURE. LOWS ONCE AGAIN WILL RUN IN THE 40S...WITH A FEW UPPER 30S IN THE SOUTHERN TIER. IT NOW APPEARS THAT THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH OF A BREEZE BOTH TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHTS TO PRECLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF FROST IN THE SOUTHERN TIER/NORTH COUNTRY IN SPITE OF TEMPERATURES THAT WILL BE DIPPING INTO THE 30S.  
IT WILL BE A DRY DAY ON THURSDAY WITH PASSING HIGH CLOUDS AS THE REGION WILL REMAIN UNDERNEATH THE FLATTENED BASE OF A DEEP UPPER LEVEL LOW CENTERED NEAR JAMES BAY. THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL AMPLIFY ONCE MORE ACROSS THE AREA ON FRIDAY AS A JET MAX DROPS INTO THE BASE OF THE TROUGH OVER NORTHEASTERN ONTARIO. THIS WILL HELP PUSH ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS UPSTATE AND WESTERN NEW YORK ON FRIDAY...POTENTIALLY TRIGGERING A SHOWER OR TWO ACROSS THE NORTH COUNTRY. HOWEVER...A LACK OF MOISTURE WILL ONCE AGAIN LIMIT POPS TO A SLIGHT CHANCE AT BEST.  AN EVEN MORE BENIGN PATTERN TAKES SHAPE FOR THE COMING WEEKEND AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE TRACKS OVER THE LOWER GREAT LAKES. THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TO BE HAD FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AS THE HIGH MOVES OVERHEAD BEFORE MOVING OFF THE EAST COAST SUNDAY. AS THE HIGH MOVES OFF THE EAST COAST...LOOK FOR RETURN FLOW TO SET UP ACROSS THE LOWER GREAT LAKES THAT WILL SIGNAL A RETURN TO WARMER CONDITIONS SUNDAY WITH UNSETTLED WEATHER LIKELY TO FOLLOW BY MONDAY AS A WARM FRONT LIFTS NORTH ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES.  REGARDING TEMPERATURES...READINGS WILL RUN IN THE 60S ON THURSDAY. WHILE CERTAINLY WARMER THAN THE CHILLY 50S EXPECTED WEDNESDAY...THE LOWER GREAT LAKES REGION WILL REMAIN CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE AFOREMENTIONED UPPER LEVEL LOW TO KEEP TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. INDEED THE PASSAGE OF THE WEAK COOL FRONT FRIDAY WILL KNOCK TEMPS BACK A COUPLE OF DEGREES. WITH HIGH PRESSURE MOVING BUILDING FRIDAY NIGHT AND COOL/DRY AIR IN PLACE...WE SHOULD SEE A CHILLY NIGHT WITH LOWS IN THE LOW/MID 40S...WITH UPPER 30S IN THE SOUTHERN TIER AND NORTH COUNTRY. THIS TIME WINDS MAY BE LIGHT ENOUGH TO POTENTIALLY ALLOW FOR FROST ACROSS THE SHELTERED AREAS OF THE NORTH COUNTRY AND THE SOUTHERN TIER. THEREAFTER...TEMPERATURES SHOULD GRADUALLY REBOUND THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS THE HIGH DRIFTS EAST OF THE REGION AND RETURN FLOW TAKES HOLD WITH WIDESPREAD 70S EXPECTED ONCE AGAIN BY SUNDAY.  
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP ACROSS INTERIOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHER TIER...GENESEE VALLEY AND FINGER LAKES REGIONS TODAY. THE MAIN THREAT WILL BE VERY HEAVY RAINFALL...AND THUS MVFR/IFR FLIGHT CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE IN THE HEAVIER SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. KBUF/KIAG SHOULD REMAIN RAIN FREE WITH MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS PREVAILING. MOST OF THE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WILL STAY JUST SOUTH AND EAST OF KROC/KART...BUT CANNOT RULE OUT THUNDERSTORM CLIPPING THE TERMINAL. SOME LOW CLOUDS/FOG MAY BRING IFR TO KJHW LATE TONIGHT ESPECIALLY IF HEAVY RAIN FALLS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER.  OUTLOOK... TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...VFR.  
LIGHT WINDS AND MINIMAL WAVES WILL CONTINUE ON THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES TODAY WITH AREAS OF FOG AS A WARM AND HUMID AIRMASS REMAINS OVER THE COOL LAKE WATERS. CONDITIONS ON THE LAKES SHOULD REMAIN QUIET OUTSIDE OF ANY THUNDERSTORMS PRODUCING ASSOCIATED HIGHER WINDS AND WAVES.  A COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP ACROSS THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES LATE TONIGHT/TUESDAY WITH AN INCREASE IN WIND SPEED AND WAVE ACTION INTO TUESDAY. A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR THE LAKE ERIE NEARSHORES COVERING TUESDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN BUILD OVER THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK WITH LOW WIND AND WAVE ACTION.  
AS OF 120 PM EDT MONDAY...LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM APPROACHING FROM THE WEST IS BRINGING SOUTHERLY WINDS DURING THE AFTERNOON. SOUTH WINDS ARE NEAR LAKE WIND ADVISORY NOW AT 10-25 KNOTS. SOUTH WINDS 15-25 KNOTS TO CONTINUE OVERNIGHT AND INTO TUESDAY, UNTIL THE COLD FRONT PASSES AROUND MID DAY TUESDAY AND WIND SHIFTS TO WEST. WAVES OF 1-3 FEET ARE EXPECTED FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.  
AS OF 1230 PM EDT...LOTS OF STRATUS CLOUDS DOWN SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL REGION...BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY ERODING FROM THE EAST.  TEMPERATURES IN MANY CASES HAVE REACHED (OR EVEN EXCEEDED) OUR PROJECT HIGHS SO INCREASE AFTERNOON HIGHS 3-5 DEGREES.  SO FAR...RADARS NOT DETECTING ANY CONVECTION JUST YET BUT SOME CU WERE FORMING ACROSS THE ADIRONDACKS AND CATSKILLS.   CHANCES FOR SHOWERS LOOK TO BE MAINLY FOR FAR WESTERN AREAS THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON...BASED ON AREA SOUNDINGS AND HAVE REDUCED CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE EASTERN CATSKILLS AND SCHOHARIE VALLEY UNTIL CLOSER TO SUNSET. HIGHS AROUND 80 OR HIGHER IN VALLEYS AREA FROM THE CAPITAL REGION NORTHWARD. FURTHER SOUTH WITH MORE CLOUDS AND MARINE INFLUENCE...HIGHS WILL BE HELD TO THE MID OR UPPER 70S. 70S WILL ALSO BE COMMON ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN.  THE THREAT OF SHOWERS WILL BE INCREASING THIS AFTERNOON...BUT MAINLY FOR AREAS WEST OF THE HUDSON RIVER. WESTERN NEW ENGLAND ZONES SHOULD REMAIN DRY THROUGH 600 PM.  
THE THREAT FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL SLOWLY SPREAD EASTWARD THIS EVENING...BUT DURING THE NIGHT ANY CONVECTION WILL SLOWLY DIMINISH AS THE MARITIME/MORE STABLE AIR BEGINS TO DOMINATE. HOWEVER...THE PCPN WILL TRANSITION TO MAINLY AN OVERUNING TYPE PATTERN WITH NUMEROUS SHOWERS EXPECTED IN MOST AREAS. POPS ARE FORECAST TO RISE TO LIKELY IN ALL AREAS BY LATE TONIGHT...AND CONTINUE IN THE LIKELY RANGE INTO EARLY TUESDAY. AS THE WARM FRONT MOVES THROUGH...THE MORE NUMEROUS SHOWERS WILL EXIT THE REGION...BUT SCATTERED MORE CONVECTIVE SHOWERS/TSTMS WILL DEVELOP ONCE AGAIN DURING THE AFTERNOON...AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT. WITH A BETTER WIND FLOW ON TUESDAY...ANY TSTMS COULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY GUSTY WINDS. LOWS TONIGHT WILL BE 50 TO 60. HIGHS TUESDAY IN THE UPPER 60S AND 70S.  THE SHOWERS AND TSTMS WILL END IN MOST AREAS EARLY TUESDAY EVENING...BUT AN UPPER LEVEL TROF WILL KEEP SCATTERED TO ISOLATED SHOWERS GOING OVER THE ADIRONDACKS THROUGH THE NIGHT AND INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. MUCH COOLER AIR WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPS EXPECTED BEHIND THIS COLD FRONT. LOWS TUESDAY NIGHT WILL GENERALLY BE IN THE UPPER 30S AND 40S. HIGHS WEDNESDAY ONLY IN THE MID 50S TO MID 60S.  
OVERALL TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL WITH BELOW NORMAL PRECIPITATION CONTINUING THROUGH THE LONG TERM ENDING SUNDAY.  THE PERIOD STARTS OUT WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY WITH TRANQUIL AND COOL CONDITIONS WITH A DRY WEST-NORTHWEST FLOW REGIME IN PLACE. LOW TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY NIGHT MAY BE COLD ENOUGH FOR FROST IN PARTS OF THE ADIRONDACKS...WHERE THE GROWING SEASON WILL BEGIN.  AN UPPER LEVEL LOW IS FORECAST TO TRACK EASTWARD ACROSS QUEBEC ON FRIDAY...WHICH WILL BE TOO FAR NORTH TO HAVE MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON OUR AREA. HOWEVER...A COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER TROUGH MAY TRIGGER ISOLATED SHOWERS ACROSS THE ADIRONDACKS. MOISTURE LOOKS RATHER LIMITED SO WILL ONLY MENTION SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AT THIS TIME.  HIGH PRESSURE LOOKS TO THEN BUILD IN FOR SATURDAY OF MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AND TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL. THE HIGH SHIFTS SOUTHEAST OF THE AREA ON SUNDAY...INDUCING A SOUTHERLY FLOW BRINGING WARMER AIR INTO THE REGION. SO TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM BACK INTO THE 70S.  
NO WIDESPREAD HYDRO PROBLEMS ARE EXPECTED THE NEXT 5 DAYS.  THE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INCREASE WILL INCREASE FROM LATER TODAY AFTERNOON THROUGH TUESDAY. MOST OF THE HYDRO SERVICE AREA COULD GET A QUARTER TO HALF INCH OF RAINFALL...BUT LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS ARE POSSIBLE IN THUNDERSTORMS. DRY CONDITIONS WILL RETURN FOR THE MID WEEK PERIOD THROUGH THE END THE WEEK.  FOR DETAILS ON SPECIFIC AREA RIVERS AND LAKES...INCLUDING OBSERVED AND FORECAST RIVER STAGES AND LAKE ELEVATIONS...PLEASE VISIT THE ADVANCED HYDROLOGIC PREDICTION SERVICE /AHPS/ GRAPHS ON OUR WEBSITE.  
THROUGH 12Z TUESDAY...THE PATCHY FOG HAS BURNED OFF THIS MORNING AND MOST LOCATIONS ARE EXPERIENCING VFR CONDITIONS WITH VERY LITTLE CLOUD COVER. THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THIS IS KMPV WHERE MVFR CEILINGS EXIST AND WILL CONTINUE THROUGH 16Z BEFORE ERODING. VFR CONDITIONS WILL EXIST FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE AFTERNOON...THEN CUMULUS CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO DEVELOP OVER THE AREA WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS AFTER 20Z ACROSS NORTHERN NEW YORK AND AFTER 06Z ACROSS VERMONT AS SHOWERS WILL BE MOVING FROM WEST TO EAST. VISIBILITIES WILL GENERALLY BE IN THE VFR CATEGORY...BUT MAY LOWER INTO THE MVFR CATEGORY IN ANY OF THE SHOWERS. WINDS WILL BE INCREASING THIS MORNING FROM THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST WITH GUSTS IN THE 15 TO 25 KNOT RANGE.  OUTLOOK 12Z TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...  12Z TUESDAY THROUGH 00Z WEDNESDAY...BKN/OVC VFR/MVFR WITH SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS. BRIEF IFR POSSIBLE IN HEAVIER DOWNPOURS. THUNDER POSSIBLE.  00Z WEDNESDAY ONWARD...MAINLY VFR WITH HIGH PRESSURE.  
AS OF 721 AM EDT MONDAY...LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM APPROACHING FROM THE WEST WILL GENERATE SOUTHERLY WINDS DURING THE DAY TODAY. SOUTH WINDS 5-10 KNOTS IN THE MORNING WILL INCREASE IN SPEED IN THE AFTERNOON AND REACH LAKE WIND ADVISORY BY EARLY EVENING, IN THE SECOND PERIOD OF THE RECREATIONAL FORECAST. SOUTH WINDS 15-25 KNOTS TO CONTINUE OVERNIGHT AND INTO TUESDAY, UNTIL THE COLD FRONT PASSES AROUND MID DAY TUESDAY AND WIND SHIFTS TO WEST. WAVES LESS THAN A FOOT THIS MORNING WILL BUILD ALONG WITH THE WIND THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.  
A SOUTHERLY FLOW HAS BROUGHT STRATUS TO THE SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL REGION. THESE WILL TEND TO DISSIPATE A LITTLE THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...A COLD FRONT TO OUR WEST WILL TRIGGER THE THREAT FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THIS COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY MOVE ACROSS THE REGION TUESDAY AFTERNOON...AND THE THREAT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE. A MUCH COOLER AIR MASS WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THE COLD FRONT...WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES EXPECTED FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.   
AS OF 1230 PM EDT...LOTS OF STRATUS CLOUDS DOWN SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL REGION...BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY ERODING FROM THE EAST.  TEMPERATURES IN MANY CASES HAVE REACHED (OR EVEN EXCEEDED) OUR PROJECT HIGHS SO INCREASE AFTERNOON HIGHS 3-5 DEGREES.  SO FAR...RADARS NOT DETECTING ANY CONVECTION JUST YET BUT SOME CU WERE FORMING ACROSS THE ADIRONDACKS AND CATSKILLS.   CHANCES FOR SHOWERS LOOK TO BE MAINLY FOR FAR WESTERN AREAS THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON...BASED ON AREA SOUNDINGS AND HAVE REDUCED CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE EASTERN CATSKILLS AND SCHOHARIE VALLEY UNTIL CLOSER TO SUNSET. HIGHS AROUND 80 OR HIGHER IN VALLEYS AREA FROM THE CAPITAL REGION NORTHWARD. FURTHER SOUTH WITH MORE CLOUDS AND MARINE INFLUENCE...HIGHS WILL BE HELD TO THE MID OR UPPER 70S. 70S WILL ALSO BE COMMON ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN.  THE THREAT OF SHOWERS WILL BE INCREASING THIS AFTERNOON...BUT MAINLY FOR AREAS WEST OF THE HUDSON RIVER. WESTERN NEW ENGLAND ZONES SHOULD REMAIN DRY THROUGH 600 PM.  
A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO BUILD SOUTHWARD ALONG THE NEW ENGLAND COAST AND IS INDUCING AN EASTERLY MARINE FLOW ACROSS NEW ENGLAND AT THIS TIME. THE STRATUS SHOULD REMAIN EAST OF KALB/KGFL THIS MORNING...SO EXPECTING VFR CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE.  BKN STRATUS CLOUD DECK SHOULD ENVELOPE THE ENTIRE AREA BY EARLY AFTERNOON...WITH GENERALLY VFR LEVEL CIGS AT KGFL/KALB AND MVFR CIGS AT KPSF/KPOU. SOME IFR CIGS WILL LINGER AT KPSF FOR A FEW HOURS AFTER 12Z BEFORE CIGS RISE TO MVFR LEVELS. DRY CONDITIONS SHOULD PERSIST THROUGH THE DAYLIGHT HOURS. CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM WILL INCREASE AFTER 00Z TUESDAY AS A FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPROACHES FROM THE WEST.  WINDS WILL INITIALLY BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE...BECOMING EAST-SOUTHEAST AROUND 7-12 KTS BY LATE THIS MORNING. SOME HIGHER GUSTS NEAR 20 KTS WILL BE POSSIBLE AT KALB DUE TO CHANNELING UP THE HUDSON VALLEY.  OUTLOOK...  TUESDAY NIGHT: MODERATE OPERATIONAL IMPACT. CHANCE OF SHRA. WEDNESDAY: LOW OPERATIONAL IMPACT. BREEZY. NO SIG WX. WEDNESDAY NIGHT: NO OPERATIONAL IMPACT. NO SIG WX. THURSDAY TO SATURDAY: NO OPERATIONAL IMPACT. NO SIG WX.  
A VERY QUIET PD WITH A WNW FLOW ALOFT AND BLDG SFC HIPRES. THIS WILL RESULT IN GNRLY DRY AND SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN NRML WX FOR THE LONG TERM. ONLY REAL WX ITEM TO DISCUSS IS A SCNDRY COLD FNT SLIDING INTO NEW ENG ON FRI WHICH PTNLY COULD TRIGGER A FEW SHWRS OVER THE ERN AREAS FRI AFTN. HAVE GONE WITH THE DRY HPC GUID FOR NOW BUT THIS PSBLTY CANNOT BE RULED OUT. BEYOND THAT...A LRG SFC BLDS IN BHD THE FNT AND DRY AND COOL WX WILL CONT THRU THE END OF THE PD...AND BEYOND.  
12Z UPDATE... COMPLICATED AVIATION SCENARIO THIS TAF PERIOD...AS A SURFACE TROUGH MOVES IN FROM THE WEST WITH SOME MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY...YET FLOW AROUND HIGH PRESSURE OVER NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND WILL SLIDE FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND MARINE LAYER IN FROM THE EAST LATE TODAY INTO TONIGHT. SQUEEZE PLAY CAUSING LIFT BETWEEN THESE FEATURES...SHOULD YIELD DEVELOPING SHRA-TSRA THIS AFTERNOON...WITH AT LEAST SHRA THIS EVENING AND POSSIBLY STILL EMBEDDED TSRA. BEFORE THEN...GENERALLY VFR EXCEPT FOR A BRIEF TIME THIS MORNING AT KELM /LINGERING LOW CIG-VIS TO 13Z/. WINDS WILL FLUCTUATE BETWEEN LIGHT SE/LIGHT SW...EXCEPT FOR ERRATIC GUSTS NEAR CB THIS AFTERNOON. MVFR CIGS/VIS AND -SHRA TONIGHT...DIPPING TO IFR CIG FOR KBGM.  
THE FORECAST AREA LIES BENEATH AN AMPLIFIED 500MB RIDGE THIS MORNING WITH STACKED SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE MINNESOTA ARROWHEAD CONTINUING TO SPREAD WARM AND MOIST AIR NORTH ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. AT 12Z...KBUF SOUNDING INDICATED PW VALUES NEAR 1.5 INCHES...AND WITH CONTINUED MOISTURE ADVECTION FORECAST SOUNDINGS PUSH PW VALUES TO AROUND 1.7 INCHES BY THIS AFTERNOON.  FORCING FOR CONVECTION TODAY WILL COME FROM A FEW DISORGANIZED SOURCES: 1/ A SURFACE TROUGH IS ANALYZED ROUGHLY FROM NORTHERN MI SOUTHEAST TO NEAR KERI...2/FROM A WEAK SHORTWAVE LIFTING OUT OF THE MID-WEST AND OVER THE RIDGE THIS AFTERNOON...AND 3/ INLAND MOVING LAKE BREEZE BOUNDARIES FROM LAKE ERIE/LAKE ONTARIO. WITH PLENTY OF MOISTURE AND UNSTABLE LAPSE RATES ALOFT...GETTING CONVECTION TO INITIATE THIS AFTERNOON SHOULDNT BE A PROBLEM DESPITE VIS SATELLITE DEPICTING A LAYER OF STRATUS ACROSS WESTERN NY THIS MORNING.  BY EARLY AFTERNOON FORECAST CAPE VALUES OF 1-2K J/KG WILL FEED MORE NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING FROM THE SOUTHERN TIER ACROSS THE GENESEE VALLEY AND FINGER LAKES. A STABLE SOUTHWEST FLOW OFF LAKE ERIE SHOULD KEEP MUCH OF THE NIAGARA FRONTIER /INCLUDING BUFFALO AND NIAGARA FALLS/ PROTECTED FROM THE HEAVIER STORMS BUT LAKE BREEZES COULD TRIGGER ADDITIONAL CELLS TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF BUFFALO. BULK SHEAR THIS AFTERNOON IS FORECAST ONLY AROUND 15 KTS SO TOO WEAK TO SUPPORT ANY SIGNIFICANT WIND/HAIL THREAT. INSTEAD...THE MAIN THREAT WILL BE VERY HEAVY RAINFALL FROM THE GENESEE VALLEY EAST ACROSS THE FINGER LAKES. WITH NEAR-RECORD PW VALUES...NEAR- STATIONARY UPSTREAM PROPAGATION VECTORS...TRAINING OF THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE SAME AREAS IS A GOOD POSSIBILITY...AND COULD LEAD TO LOCALIZED VERY HEAVY RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.  TONIGHT...THE SURFACE LOW WILL SHIFT NORTH OF THE GREAT LAKES TO SOUTHERN QUEBEC. NEAR-TERM MODELS INDICATE THE MAJORITY OF REMAINING CONVECTION WILL BE LIMITED FROM THE FINGER LAKES EASTWARD ACROSS CENTRAL AND EASTERN NEW YORK. WESTERN NEW YORK WILL LARGELY REMAIN DRY. THE COLD FRONT WILL CROSS WNY LATE TONIGHT AND IS FORECAST TO BE NEAR THE FINGER LAKES BY 12Z TUESDAY WITH SKY COVER THINNING FROM WEST TO EAST. THE OVERNIGHT TIMING OF THE FRONT SHOULD LIMIT A SECOND ROUND OF SHOWER/TSTM ACTIVITY.  TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL AGAIN RISE ABOVE NORMAL WITHIN A HUMID AIRMASS. 850MB TEMPS OF NEAR +15C WILL SUPPORT SURFACE HIGH TEMPS RANGING FROM THE UPPER 70S TO MID 80S. THE U70S TEMPS WILL ONLY BE LIMITED BY EARLIER START TO CONVECTION WHILE MORE HEATING ACROSS FINGER LAKES AND NORTH COUNTRY WILL HELP BOOST TEMPS TO THE M80S.  
VFR CONDITIONS IN PLACE EARLY THIS MORNING EXCEPT FOR SOME IFR FOG ACROSS THE HILLTOPS OF THE SOUTHERN TIER. THIS WILL WILL DISSIPATE IN THE MORNING WITH INCREASING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR KJHW/KROC/KART DURING THE LATE MORNING AND AFTERNOON AS A PRE- FRONTAL TROUGH CROSSES THE FORECAST AREA. A STABLE FLOW OFF LAKE ERIE SHOULD KEEP KBUF/KIAG FREE FROM ANY HEAVY STORMS WHICH WILL DEVELOP FROM THE SOUTHERN TIER TO EAST OF BUFFALO TO ROCHESTER AND SYRACUSE. STORM ACTIVITY WILL SHIFT EAST LATER THIS EVENING WITH MAINLY DRY CONDITIONS EXPECTED TONIGHT. SOME LOW CLOUDS/FOG MAY BRING IFR TO KJHW LATE TONIGHT ESPECIALLY IF HEAVY RAIN FALLS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER.  OUTLOOK... TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...VFR.  
FORECAST GENERALLY ON TRACK. A BACK DOOR COLD FRONT REMAINS JUST WEST OF THE REGION. SOME LOW STRATUS AND PATCHY FOG CONTINUE FOR MUCH OF THE REGION. THERE MAY BE A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS LATE THIS MORNING.  QUESTION OF THE DAY IS WHETHER OR NOT THE STRATUS BREAKS UP...AND IF SO...HOW MUCH? LATEST VISIBILE SHOWING SOME CLEARING ACROSS EASTERN CT AND INTO THE NORTH FORK OF LI. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THE CLEARING.  WITH E/SE FLOW...TEMPS WILL BE MUCH COLDER TODAY AS COMPARED TO SUNDAY...WITH HIGHS HOLDING AROUND 60 ACROSS EASTERN CT...LONG ISLAND...AND ALONG THE COASTS. INTERIOR ZONES WEST OF THE HUDSON RIVER WILL BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER...TOPPING OFF IN THE UPPER 60S TO AROUND 70...DUE TO THE OCNL BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS ALLOWING A BIT MORE SUNSHINE TO FILTER THROUGH.  
A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE WEST ACROSS EASTERN PA...STALL...THEN MOVE EAST ACROSS THE REGION AS A WARM FRONT TONIGHT.  WIDESPREAD IFR WITH POCKETS OF LIFR CONTINUE ACROSS CITY TERMINALS THIS MORNING. IMPROVEMENTS TO MVFR EXPECTED EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. HIGH END MVFR IS LIKELY MIDDLE TO LATE AFTERNOON.  CLEARING HAS OCCURRED ACROSS SE CT AND E LONG ISLAND AND THIS MAY WORK ITS WAY WESTWARD THIS AFTERNOON.  NE-E WINDS 10-15 KT THROUGH THE DAY...THEN SE AT 5-10 KT TONIGHT.  LOW STRATUS AND FOG...POSSIBLY DENSE...ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN AFTER SUNSET AND CONTINUE THROUGH TONIGHT.       NY METRO ENHANCED AVIATION WEATHER SUPPORT...

SHRA/TSTM. 
A WEAK PRES GRADIENT WILL KEEP CONDS BELOW SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDS THROUGH TUESDAY. AREAS OF FOG ON THE WATERS EARLY THIS MORNING WILL DISSIPATE...AND THEN FOG WILL REDEVELOP TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE WATERS LATE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...AND THEN A FEW GUSTS TO 20 KT ARE LIKELY TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE GRADIENT TIGHTENS BEHIND THE DEPARTING COLD FRONT.  SUB-SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED WED THROUGH FRI WITH A RELATIVELY LIGHT FLOW PERSISTING ACROSS THE AREA. NW GUSTS MAY REACH AROUND 20 KT WED INTO WED NIGHT BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. OFFSHORE FLOW WILL KEEP OCEAN SEAS BELOW 5 FT.  
CLOUDS WILL INCREASE TODAY AHEAD OF A WARM FRONT THAT WILL LIFT INTO THE REGION. THIS WILL RESULT IN INCREASING CLOUDS AND AN INCREASING THREAT FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REGION TUESDAY AFTERNOON... AND THE THREAT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE. A MUCH COOLER AIR MASS WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THE COLD FRONT...WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES EXPECTED FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.  
LOW CLOUDS IN WESTERN NEW ENGLAND AND THE MID HUDSON VALLEY ARE SLOW TO ERODE AND WILL SLOWLY ERODE THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON...WHEN MOST OF THE CLOUDS SHOULD MIX OUT. HAVE MODIFIED CLOUD COVER AND TEMPERATURES A BIT FOR THOSE AREAS THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON. CHANCES FOR SHOWERS LOOK TO BE MAINLY FOR FAR WESTERN AREAS THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON...BASED ON AREA SOUNDINGS AND HAVE REDUCED CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE EASTERN CATSKILLS AND SCHOHARIE VALLEY UNTIL CLOSER TO SUNSET. HIGHS MAINLY WELL INTO THE 70S TO NEAR 80...EXCEPT FOR THE AREAS WHERE THE CLOUDS ARE SLOW TO ERODE...AND IN HIGHER TERRAIN...WHERE TEMPERATURES WILL BE A LITTLE COOLER.  THE THREAT OF SHOWERS WILL BE INCREASING THIS AFTERNOON...BUT MAINLY FOR AREAS WEST OF THE HUDSON RIVER. WESTERN NEW ENGLAND ZONES SHOULD REMAIN DRY THROUGH 600 PM.  
AS OF 1001 AM EDT MONDAY...MAINLY JUST CHANGES TO REFLECT CURRENT OBSERVATIONS THIS MORNING. GOING FORECAST WAS ALREADY IN GOOD SHAPE. PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS FOLLOW.  MAIN CHANGE WITH THIS UPDATE WAS TO DELINEATE CLOUDS IN EASTERN VERMONT ASSOCIATED WITH BACK DOOR COLD FRONT. SUNRISE HAS REVEALED SOLID LOW OVERCAST ON VISIBLE SATELLITE OVER MUCH OF EASTERN VERMONT. PREVIOUS FORECAST HAD GENERAL OUTLINE BUT WAY LOW ON TOTAL SKY COVER IN THAT AREA. NO MODEL GUIDANCE IS PICKING UP ON THE CLOUDS SO USED THE 30 PERCENT SKY COVER AREA AND BUMPED IT UP TO OVERCAST THROUGH LATE MORNING, THEN TAPERED DOWN THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON. QUITE A BIT OF VARIABILITY IN TEMPERATURES TODAY WITH SOUTH WINDS BRINGING WARM AIR TO NORTHERN NEW YORK AND CHAMPLAIN VALLEY, WHILE BACK DOOR FRONT KEEPS EASTERN VERMONT COOLER WITH MORE CLOUDS.  SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER MAINE WILL KEEP EASTERLY FLOW OFF THE GULF OF MAINE ACROSS NH INTO EASTERN VERMONT. SURFACE OBS SHOWING EXTENT OF MOIST MARINE LAYER EVIDENT IN LOW OVERCAST BELOW 1500 FT INTO EASTERN VT. ELSEWHERE NEARLY CALM WINDS AND HIGH THIN CLOUDS WITH PATCHES OF LIGHT FOG. SOUTHERLY FLOW TO DEVELOP TODAY IN CHAMPLAIN VALLEY AND NORTHERN NY IN ADVANCE OF APPROACHING SURFACE LOW. UPPER RIDGE CRESTS OVER REGION DURING THE DAY AND SHIFTS EAST BY THE END OF THE PERIOD ALLOWING FOR CHANCE FOR SHOWERS IN ST. LAWRENCE COUNTY.  TEMPS IN ST. LAWRENCE VALLEY TO REACH THE MID 80S...WITH 70S ELSEWHERE AND EASTERN VERMONT ONLY IN THE 60S. MARINE LAYER IS SHALLOW AND DO NOT EXPECT IT TO BECOME BLOCKED BY THE GREEN MOUNTAINS AND REMAIN IN EASTERN VT. SOUTHERLY FLOW UP THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY WILL ALSO KEEP ANY MARINE INVERSION MIXED OUT AS WELL. WINDS TO INCREASE TO 15 TO 25 KNOTS.  
THE FORECAST AREA LIES BENEATH AN AMPLIFIED 500MB RIDGE THIS MORNING WITH STACKED SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE MINNESOTA ARROWHEAD CONTINUING TO SPREAD WARM AND MOIST AIR NORTH ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. DEWPOINTS RISING INTO THE MID 60S ACROSS WESTERN NEW YORK AS A RIBBON OF HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AROUND 1.7 INCHES /NEAR MAX ON MID MAY SOUNDING CLIMO/ RUNNING FROM NORTH OF GEORGIAN BAY TO LAKE ERIE. PLENTY OF MOISTURE TO BE FOUND SO FOCUS FOR TIMING OF SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY TODAY WILL BE ON ANY SYNOPTIC/MESOSCALE FEATURES SHIFTING ACROSS THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES.  A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH IS ANALYZED ROUGHLY FROM NORTHERN MI SOUTHEAST TO NEAR KERI. THIS IS FORECAST TO SHIFT ACROSS WESTERN AND CENTRAL NEW YORK TODAY. LOOKING TO THE MID-LEVELS...FORCING MAY ALSO COME FROM ANY SUBTLE SHORTWAVES ROLLING UP THE WEST SIDE OF THE RIDGE AXIS FROM THE MISS VALLEY TOWARD THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES. MESOSCALE GUIDANCE SUCH AS WRF AND HRRR MODELS SUGGEST A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS MAY WORK INTO WNY ALONG THE TROUGH THIS MORNING. BY EARLY AFTERNOON FORECAST CAPE OF 2-3K J/KG WILL FEED MORE NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING FROM THE SOUTHERN TIER ACROSS THE GENESEE VALLEY AND FINGER LAKES. A STABLE SOUTHWEST FLOW OFF LAKE ERIE SHOULD KEEP MUCH OF THE NIAGARA FRONTIER PROTECTED FROM THE HEAVIER STORMS BUT LAKE BREEZES COULD TRIGGER ADDITIONAL CELLS TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF BUFFALO. BULK SHEAR THIS AFTERNOON IS FORECAST ONLY AROUND 15 KTS SO TOO WEAK TO SUPPORT ANY SIGNIFICANT WIND/HAIL THREAT. THE DEEP MOISTURE IN PLACE PER PWATS AND SKINNY CAPE PROFILES WITH SLOW STORM MOTIONS WILL HOWEVER BRING A RISK FOR LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN AND FLOODING IF ANY TRAINING CELLS DEVELOPS.  TONIGHT...THE SURFACE LOW WILL SHIFT NORTH OF THE GREAT LAKES TO SOUTHERN QUEBEC. NEAR-TERM MODELS INDICATE THE MAJORITY OF REMAINING CONVECTION WILL BE LIMITED FROM THE FINGER LAKES EASTWARD ACROSS CENTRAL AND EASTERN NEW YORK. WESTERN NEW YORK WILL LARGELY REMAIN DRY. THE COLD FRONT WILL CROSS WNY LATE TONIGHT AND IS FORECAST TO BE NEAR THE FINGER LAKES BY 12Z TUESDAY WITH SKY COVER THINNING FROM WEST TO EAST. THE OVERNIGHT TIMING OF THE FRONT SHOULD LIMIT A SECOND ROUND OF SHOWER/TSTM ACTIVITY.  TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL AGAIN RISE ABOVE NORMAL WITHIN A HUMID AIRMASS. 850MB TEMPS OF NEAR +15C WILL SUPPORT SURFACE HIGH TEMPS RANGING FROM THE UPPER 70S TO MID 80S. THE U70S TEMPS WILL ONLY BE LIMITED BY EARLIER START TO CONVECTION WHILE MORE HEATING ACROSS FINGER LAKES AND NORTH COUNTRY WILL HELP BOOST TEMPS TO THE M80S.  
HAVE UPDATED TO INCLUDE A FEW SHOWERS THIS MORNING ACROSS THE NYC METRO AND THE LOWER HUDSON VALLEY AS A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT COLLIDES WITH AN AREA OF MARGINAL ELEVATED INSTABILITY. IN ADDITION...ADVECTION FOG COMING OFF THE SURROUNDING WATERS WILL BE LOCALLY DENSE THIS MORNING UNTIL LOWER DEW POINT AIR FILTERS IN FROM THE EAST.  BACKDOOR COLD FRONT STALLS JUST WEST OF THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON. MEANWHILE...HIGH PRES OVER THE CANADIAN MARITIMES BUILDS SOUTH ALONG THE NEW ENGLAND COAST AND INTO THE AREA. THIS WILL RESULT IN AN EASTERLY FLOW THAT WILL USHER A COOLER AIRMASS.  WIDESPREAD STRATUS WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE DAY...WITH OCNL BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS FROM TIME TO TIME WEST OF THE HUDSON RIVER. WITH E/SE FLOW...TEMPS WILL BE MUCH COLDER TODAY AS COMPARED TO SUNDAY...WITH HIGHS HOLDING AROUND 60 ACROSS EASTERN CT...LONG ISLAND...AND ALONG THE COASTS. INTERIOR ZONES WEST OF THE HUDSON RIVER WILL BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER...TOPPING OFF IN THE UPPER 60S TO AROUND 70...DUE TO THE OCNL BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS ALLOWING A BIT MORE SUNSHINE TO FILTER THROUGH.  
A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE WEST ACROSS EASTERN PA...STALL...THEN MOVE EAST ACROSS THE REGION AS A WARM FRONT TONIGHT.  WIDESPREAD MVFR FOG ALONG WITH AREAS OF LIFR DENSE FOG WILL CONTINUE UNTIL AROUND 15Z. LIFR/IFR CIGS WILL CONTINUE MOVING WEST ACROSS NORTHERN NJ AND THE LOWER HUDSON VALLEY BY 14Z.  SUB VFR CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST TO LINGER THROUGH THE MORNING PUSH. EXPECT CIGS TO IMPROVE TO HIGH END MVFR DURING THE AFTERNOON.  LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS WILL GIVE WAY TO E WINDS 10-15 KT THROUGH THE DAY...THEN SE AT 5-10 KT TONIGHT.  WIDESPREAD DENSE FOG IS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE REGION AFTER SUNSET WHICH WILL CONTINUE THRU THE NIGHT. STAY TUNED.       NY METRO ENHANCED AVIATION WEATHER SUPPORT...

AS OF 721 AM EDT MONDAY...MAIN CHANGE WITH THIS UPDATE WAS TO DELINEATE CLOUDS IN EASTERN VERMONT ASSOCIATED WITH BACK DOOR COLD FRONT. SUNRISE HAS REVEALED SOLID LOW OVERCAST ON VISIBLE SATELLITE OVER MUCH OF EASTERN VERMONT. PREVIOUS FORECAST HAD GENERAL OUTLINE BUT WAY LOW ON TOTAL SKY COVER IN THAT AREA. NO MODEL GUIDANCE IS PICKING UP ON THE CLOUDS SO USED THE 30 PERCENT SKY COVER AREA AND BUMPED IT UP TO OVERCAST THROUGH LATE MORNING, THEN TAPERED DOWN THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON. QUITE A BIT OF VARIABILITY IN TEMPERATURES TODAY WITH SOUTH WINDS BRINGING WARM AIR TO NORTHERN NEW YORK AND CHAMPLAIN VALLEY, WHILE BACK DOOR FRONT KEEPS EASTERN VERMONT COOLER WITH MORE CLOUDS.  SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER MAINE WILL KEEP EASTERLY FLOW OFF THE GULF OF MAINE ACROSS NH INTO EASTERN VERMONT. SURFACE OBS SHOWING EXTENT OF MOIST MARINE LAYER EVIDENT IN LOW OVERCAST BELOW 1500 FT INTO EASTERN VT. ELSEWHERE NEARLY CALM WINDS AND HIGH THIN CLOUDS WITH PATCHES OF LIGHT FOG. SOUTHERLY FLOW TO DEVELOP TODAY IN CHAMPLAIN VALLEY AND NORTHERN NY IN ADVANCE OF APPROACHING SURFACE LOW. UPPER RIDGE CRESTS OVER REGION DURING THE DAY AND SHIFTS EAST BY THE END OF THE PERIOD ALLOWING FOR CHANCE FOR SHOWERS IN ST. LAWRENCE COUNTY.  TEMPS IN ST. LAWRENCE VALLEY TO REACH THE MID 80S...WITH 70S ELSEWHERE AND EASTERN VERMONT ONLY IN THE 60S. MARINE LAYER IS SHALLOW AND DO NOT EXPECT IT TO BECOME BLOCKED BY THE GREEN MOUNTAINS AND REMAIN IN EASTERN VT. SOUTHERLY FLOW UP THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY WILL ALSO KEEP ANY MARINE INVERSION MIXED OUT AS WELL. WINDS TO INCREASE TO 15 TO 25 KNOTS.  
AS OF 721 AM EDT MONDAY...LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM APPROACHING FROM THEWEST WILL GENERATE SOUTHERLY WINDS DURING THE DAY TODAY. SOUTH WINDS 5-10 KNOTS IN THE MORNING WILL INCREASE IN SPEED IN THE AFTERNOONAND REACH LAKE WIND ADVISORY BY EARLY EVENING, IN THE SECOND PERIOD OF THE RECREATIONAL FORECAST. SOUTH WINDS 15-25 KNOTS TO CONTINUE OVERNIGHT AND INTO TUESDAY, UNTIL THE COLD FRONT PASSES AROUND MID DAY TUESDAY AND WIND SHIFTS TO WEST. WAVES LESS THAN A FOOT THIS MORNING WILL BUILD ALONG WITH THE WIND THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.  
AS OF 645 AM...A LOW CLOUD DECK WAS SPREADING WESTWARD ACROSS WESTERN NEW ENGLAND...WHILE MID LEVEL CLOUDS SPREAD EASTWARD FROM CENTRAL AND WESTERN NEW YORK. THE LOW CLOUD DECK IS THE RESULT OF MOIST MARITIME AIR SPREADING WESTWARD AROUND A HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OVER THE CANADIAN MARITIMES AND LOCATED RIGHT ALONG THE NY/WESTERN NEW ENGLAND BORDER AT 630 AM. THE MID LEVEL CLOUDS WERE SPREADING EASTWARD AHEAD OF A WARM FRONT. THIS WILL RESULT IN INCREASING CLOUDS TODAY AND TEMPS WILL NOT BE AS WARM AS YESTERDAY...ESPECIALLY ACROSS WESTERN NEW ENGLAND WERE HIGHS WILL GENERALLY BE IN THE 60S. IN NEW YORK...HIGHS WILL BE IN THE 70S... WITH SOME UPPER 60S OVER THE MID HUDSON VALLEY AND SOUTHERN CATSKILLS.  THE THREAT OF SHOWERS WILL BE INCREASING THIS AFTERNOON...BUT MAINLY FOR AREAS WEST OF THE HUDSON RIVER. WESTERN NEW ENGLAND ZONES SHOULD REMAIN DRY THROUGH 600 PM.  
A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO BUILD SOUTHWARD ALONG THE NEW ENGLAND COAST AND IS INDUCING AN EASTERLY MARINE FLOW ACROSS NEW ENGLAND AT THIS TIME. THE STRATUS SHOULD REMAIN EAST OF KALB/KGFL THIS MORNING...SO EXPECTING VFR CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE.  BKN STRATUS CLOUD DECK SHOULD ENVELOPE THE ENTIRE AREA BY EARLY AFTERNOON...WITH GENERALLY VFR LEVEL CIGS AT KGFL/KALB AND MVFR CIGS AT KPSF/KPOU. SOME IFR CIGS WILL LINGER AT KPSF FOR A FEW HOURS AFTER 12Z BEFORE CIGS RISE TO MVFR LEVELS. DRY CONDITIONS SHOULD PERSIST THROUGH THE DAYLIGHT HOURS. CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM WILL INCREASE AFTER 00Z TUESDAY AS A FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPROACHES FROM THE WEST.  WINDS WILL INITIALLY BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE...BECOMING EAST-SOUTHEAST AROUND 7-12 KTS BY LATE THIS MORNING. SOME HIGHER GUSTS NEAR 20 KTS WILL BE POSSIBLE AT KALB DUE TO CHANNELING UP THE HUDSON VALLEY.  OUTLOOK...  TUESDAY NIGHT: MODERATE OPERATIONAL IMPACT. CHANCE OF SHRA. WEDNESDAY: LOW OPERATIONAL IMPACT. BREEZY. NO SIG WX. WEDNESDAY NIGHT: NO OPERATIONAL IMPACT. NO SIG WX. THURSDAY TO SATURDAY: NO OPERATIONAL IMPACT. NO SIG WX.  
AS OF 721 AM EDT MONDAY...MAIN CHANGE WITH THIS UPDATE WAS TO DELINEATE CLOUDS IN EASTERN VERMONT ASSOCIATED WITH BACK DOOR COLD FRONT.

MARINE LAYER IS SHALLOW AND DO NOT EXPECT IT TO BECOME BLOCKED BY THE GREEN MOUNTAINS AND REMAIN IN EASTERN VT. SOUTHERLY FLOW UP THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY WILL ALSO KEEP ANY MARINE INVERSION MIXED OUT AS WELL. WINDS TO INCREASE TO 15 TO 25 KTS.  
THROUGH 06Z TUESDAY...OVERALL LOOKING AT VFR CONDITIONS FOR MUCH OF THE PERIOD. THERE WILL BE BRIEF PERIODS OF FOG BEFORE 12Z...ESPECIALLY OVER NORTHERN NEW YORK...THAT WILL CREATE IFR CONDITIONS. CLOUDS SHOULD BEGIN TO FORM LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND ESPECIALLY TONIGHT...BUT ANY CEILINGS WILL BE IN THE VFR CATEGORY. LOOK FOR ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS FORMING OVER NORTHERN NEW YORK AFTER 20Z. LIGHT WINDS THIS MORNING WILL INCREASE FROM THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST WITH GUSTS IN THE 15 TO 25 KNOT RANGE AFTER ABOUT 16Z.  OUTLOOK 06Z TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...  06Z TUESDAY THROUGH 00Z WEDNESDAY...BKN/OVC VFR/MVFR WITH SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS. BRIEF IFR POSSIBLE IN HEAVIER DOWNPOURS. THUNDER POSSIBLE.  00Z WEDNESDAY ONWARD...MAINLY VFR WITH HIGH PRESSURE.  
AS OF 721 AM EDT MONDAY...LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM APPROACHING FROMTHE WEST WILL GENERATE SOUTHERLY WINDS DURING THE DAY TODAY. SOUTH WINDS 5-10 KNOTS IN THE MORNING WILL INCREASE IN SPEED IN THE AFTERNOONT AND REACH LAKE WIND ADVISORY BY EARLY EVENING, IN THE SECOND PERIOD OF THE RECREATIONAL FORECAST.

WAVES LESS THAN A FOOT THIS MORNING WILL BUILD ALONG WITH THE WIND THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.  
430 AM MON UPDATE... UNSETTLED WX IS STILL EXPECTED THIS PD.  A NEARLY STATIONARY FRNTL BNDRY NEAR THE PA/NY BORDER EARLY THIS MRNG...WILL BEGIN TO MOVE SLOWLY NEWD AS A WARM FRNT TDY. AS OUR RESIDENT AMS DESTABILIZES THIS AFTN (SPCLY FOR AREAS NEAR AND W OF THE I-81 CORRIDOR...WHICH ARE MOST LIKELY TO BREAK INTO THE WARM SECTOR)...AND HGT FALLS ALOFT/IMPROVING UPR JET DYNAMICS BEGIN TO IMPINGE ON THE RGN LTR IN THE DAY...SHWRS/TSTMS SHOULD INCREASE IN COVERAGE BY EARLY TO MID-AFTN. THE LIKELIHOOD OF SHWRS/TSTMS SHOULD THEN CONTINUE WELL INTO THIS EVE.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE POTENTIAL FOR LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL THIS AFTN AND EVE...AS SIGNALS HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN THERE IN THE MODELS FOR THE LAST SVRL CYCLES. THESE INGREDIENTS INCLUDE DEEP MOISTURE (PWAT VALUES NEAR 1.75" AND WARM CLOUD DEPTHS OF 10-12K FEET)...TALL NARROW INSTABILITY PROFILES TO INCREASE PARCEL RESIDENCE TIMES IN THE WARM CLOUD LYR...AND THE PSBLTY FOR SLOW MOVING/TRAINING CELLS...OWING TO A FAIRLY LGT AND UNIDIRECTIONAL WIND PATN UP THROUGH THE MID-LYRS OF THE ATMOSPHERE. THUS...WE`VE MENTIONED HEAVY DOWNPOURS IN THE GRIDS...AND HAVE CONTINUED THE MENTION OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL IN THE HWO. DUE TO THE LIKELY SMALL-SCALE/ISOLD NATURE OF ANY EXCESSIVE RAINFALL...PLUS LONG- TERM DRY ANTECEDENT CONDS...AND FULL GREEN-UP...IT`S WAY TOO PREMATURE/UNCERTAIN TO CONSIDER ANY FLOOD WATCHES ATTM.  AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS...THE PROXIMITY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED WARM FRNTL BNDRY ACRS THE RGN...SHOULD LEAD TO A FAIR TEMP GRADIENT THIS AFTN (HIGHS RANGING FROM NEAR 70 OVER PTNS OF THE CATSKILLS...TO THE MID 80S IN THE FINGER LAKES RGN).  ON TUE...THE MAIN SFC COLD FRNT IS STILL EXPECTED TO CHARGE THROUGH CNY/NE PA FROM NW TO SE...MOST LIKELY DURG THE AFTN HRS. BY THIS TIME...DRIER AIR ALOFT AND LESSENING JET DYNAMICS...SHOULD ONLY LEAD TO SCTD CONVECTIVE COVERAGE ALG AND JUST PRECEDING THIS FRNT. IT DOES APPEAR...HOWEVER...THAT THERE WILL BE A SOMEWHAT GREATER WIND/HAIL THREAT...SPCLY FOR OUR ERN ZNS...AS A RESULT OF THE JUST ALLUDED TO DRIER AIR IN THE MID-LVLS...AND ALSO STGR DEEP-LYRD SHEAR.  ONCE THE FRNT CLEARS THE FA...MUCH COOLER AIR SHOULD QUICKLY ADVECT IN STARTING TUE EVE.  
A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING SOUTHWARD ALONG THE NEW ENGLAND COAST IS INDUCING AN EASTERLY MARINE FLOW ACROSS CENTRAL/EASTERN NEW ENGLAND AT THIS TIME. AS THIS RIDGE CONTINUES TO BUILD SOUTHWARD SOME LOW STRATUS CLOUDS WILL LIKELY DEVELOP AT KPSF/KPOU PRIOR TO 12Z DUE TO MARINE INFLUENCE. AS OF 06Z THE LOW STRATUS HAD MADE IT WESTWARD TO CENTRAL MA...AND JUST ENTERING EASTERN CT. SO THE STRATUS DECK IS EXPECTED TO IMPACT KPSF FIRST...AROUND 09Z-10Z WITH BORDERLINE MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS. THRESHOLDS FOR IFR WILL BE CLOSE SO WILL MENTION TEMPO FOR IFR FROM 09Z-12Z. CIGS/VSBYS SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY HIGHER AT KPOU AND ARRIVING LATER BETWEEN 10Z-12Z SO WILL ONLY MENTION MVFR FOR NOW.  THE STRATUS SHOULD REMAIN EAST OF KALB THROUGH 12Z...SO EXPECTING VFR CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE. WHILE STRATUS SHOULD REMAIN EAST OF KGFL...SOME RADIATIONAL FOG WILL BE POSSIBLE TOWARDS DAYBREAK SO ADDED MENTION OF A TEMPO FOR IFR IN FOG.  BKN-OVC STRATUS CLOUD DECK SHOULD ENVELOPE THE ENTIRE AREA BY LATE MORNING OR SO...WITH GENERALLY VFR LEVEL CIGS AT KGFL/KALB AND MVFR CIGS AT KPSF/KPOU. DRY CONDITIONS SHOULD PERSIST THROUGH THE DAYLIGHT HOURS. CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM WILL INCREASE AFTER 00Z TUESDAY AS A FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPROACHES FROM THE WEST.  WINDS WILL INITIALLY BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE...BECOMING EAST-SOUTHEAST AROUND 7-12 KTS BY LATE THIS MORNING. SOME HIGHER GUSTS NEAR 20 KTS WILL BE POSSIBLE AT KALB DUE TO CHANNELING UP THE HUDSON VALLEY.  OUTLOOK...  TUESDAY NIGHT: LOW OPERATIONAL IMPACT. SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHRA. WEDNESDAY: LOW OPERATIONAL IMPACT. BREEZY. NO SIG WX. WEDNESDAY NIGHT: NO OPERATIONAL IMPACT. NO SIG WX. THURSDAY TO SATURDAY: NO OPERATIONAL IMPACT. NO SIG WX.  
A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE TERMINALS FROM EAST TO WEST BY 12Z...RETURNING EAST AS A WARM FRONT TONIGHT.  WIDESPREAD MVFR FOG ALONG WITH PATCHY LIFR DENSE FOG WILL CONTINUE UNTIL AROUND 14Z. LIFR/IFR CIGS WILL CONTINUE MOVING WEST ACROSS CT AND LONG ISLAND...MOVING ACROSS ALL METRO TERMINALS BETWEEN 10Z AND 12Z.  SUB VFR CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST TO LINGER THROUGH THE MORNING PUSH. EXPECT CIGS TO IMPROVE TO HIGH END MVFR DURING THE AFTERNOON.  LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS WILL GIVE WAY TO E WINDS 10-15 KT THROUGH THE DAY...THEN SE AT 5-10 KT TONIGHT.  WIDESPREAD DENSE FOG IS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE REGION AFTER SUNSET WHICH WILL CONTINUE THRU THE NIGHT. STAY TUNED.       NY METRO ENHANCED AVIATION WEATHER SUPPORT...

THE FORECAST AREA LIES BENEATH AN AMPLIFIED 500MB RIDGE THIS MORNING WITH STACKED SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER NORTHERN MINNESOTA CONTINUING TO SPREAD WARM AND MOIST AIR NORTH ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. DEWPOINTS RUNNING CLOSE TO 60F ACROSS WESTERN NEW YORK WITH MID 60S DEWPOINTS FOUND ACROSS MICHIGAN. SPC MESOSCALE ANALYSIS SHOWS A RIBBON OF HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AROUND 1.7 INCHES RUNNING FROM NORTH OF GEORGIAN BAY TO LAKE ERIE. PLENTY OF MOISTURE TO BE FOUND SO FOCUS FOR TIMING OF SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY TODAY WILL BE ON ANY SYNOPTIC/MESOSCALE FEATURES SHIFTING ACROSS THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES.  A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH IS ANALYZED ROUGHLY FROM NORTHERN MI SOUTHEAST TO NEAR KERI. THIS IS FORECAST TO SHIFT ACROSS WESTERN AND CENTRAL NEW YORK TODAY. LOOKING TO THE MID-LEVELS...FORCING MAY ALSO COME FROM ANY SUBTLE SHORTWAVES ROLLING UP THE WEST SIDE OF THE RIDGE AXIS FROM THE MISS VALLEY TOWARD THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES. MESOSCALE GUIDANCE SUCH AS WRF AND HRRR MODELS SUGGEST A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS MAY WORK INTO WNY ALONG THE TROUGH THIS MORNING. BY EARLY AFTERNOON FORECAST CAPE OF 2-3K J/KG WILL FEED MORE NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING FROM THE SOUTHERN TIER ACROSS THE GENESEE VALLEY AND FINGER LAKES. A STABLE SOUTHWEST FLOW OFF LAKE ERIE SHOULD KEEP MUCH OF THE NIAGARA FRONTIER PROTECTED FROM THE HEAVIER STORMS BUT LAKE BREEZES COULD TRIGGER ADDITIONAL CELLS TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF BUFFALO. BULK SHEAR THIS AFTERNOON IS FORECAST ONLY AROUND 15 KTS SO TOO WEAK TO SUPPORT ANY SIGNIFICANT WIND/HAIL THREAT. THE DEEP MOISTURE IN PLACE PER PWATS AND SKINNY CAPE PROFILES WITH SLOW STORM MOTIONS WILL HOWEVER BRING A RISK FOR LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN AND FLOODING IF ANY TRAINING CELLS DEVELOPS.  TONIGHT...THE SURFACE LOW WILL SHIFT NORTH OF THE GREAT LAKES TO SOUTHERN QUEBEC. NEAR-TERM MODELS INDICATE THE MAJORITY OF REMAINING CONVECTION WILL BE LIMITED FROM THE FINGER LAKES EASTWARD ACROSS CENTRAL AND EASTERN NEW YORK. WESTERN NEW YORK WILL LARGELY REMAIN DRY. THE COLD FRONT WILL CROSS WNY LATE TONIGHT AND IS FORECAST TO BE NEAR THE FINGER LAKES BY 12Z TUESDAY WITH SKY COVER THINNING FROM WEST TO EAST. THE OVERNIGHT TIMING OF THE FRONT SHOULD LIMIT A SECOND ROUND OF SHOWER/TSTM ACTIVITY.  TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL AGAIN RISE ABOVE NORMAL WITHIN A HUMID AIRMASS. 850MB TEMPS OF NEAR +15C WILL SUPPORT SURFACE HIGH TEMPS RANGING FROM THE UPPER 70S TO MID 80S. THE U70S TEMPS WILL ONLY BE LIMITED BY EARLIER START TO CONVECTION WHILE MORE HEATING ACROSS FINGER LAKES AND NORTH COUNTRY WILL HELP BOOST TEMPS TO THE M80S.  
VFR CONDITIONS IN PLACE EARLY THIS MORNING EXCEPT FOR SOME IFR FOG ACROSS THE HILLTOPS OF THE SOUTHERN TIER. THIS WILL WILL DISSIPATE IN THE MORNING WITH INCREASING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE LATE MORNING AND AFTERNOON AS A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH CROSSES THE FORECAST AREA. A STABLE FLOW OFF LAKE ERIE SHOULD KEEP KBUF/KIAG FREE FROM ANY HEAVY STORMS WHICH WILL DEVELOP FROM THE SOUTHERN TIER TO EAST OF BUFFALO TO ROCHESTER AND SYRACUSE. STORM ACTIVITY WILL SHIFT EAST LATER THIS EVENING WITH MAINLY DRY CONDITIONS EXPECTED TONIGHT.  OUTLOOK...  TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...VFR.  
AS OF 430 AM...A LOW CLOUD DECK WAS SPREADING WESTWARD ACROSS WESTERN NEW ENGLAND...WHILE MID LEVEL CLOUDS SPREAD EASTWARD FROM CENTRAL AND WESTERN NEW YORK. THE LOW CLOUD DECK IS THE RESULT OF MOIST MARITIME AIR SPREADING WESTWARD AROUND A HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OVER THE CANADIAN MARITIMES. THE MID LEVEL CLOUDS WERE SPREADING EASTWARD AHEAD OF A WARM FRONT. THIS WILL RESULT IN INCREASING CLOUDS TODAY AND TEMPS WILL NOT BE AS WARM AS YESTERDAY...ESPECIALLY ACROSS WESTERN NEW ENGLAND WERE HIGHS WILL GENERALLY BE IN THE 60S. IN NEW YORK...HIGHS WILL BE IN THE 70S... WITH SOME UPPER 60S OVER THE MID HUDSON VALLEY AND SOUTHERN CATSKILLS.  THE THREAT OF SHOWERS WILL BE INCREASING THIS AFTERNOON...BUT MAINLY FOR AREAS WEST OF THE HUDSON RIVER. WESTERN NEW ENGLAND ZONES SHOULD REMAIN DRY THROUGH 600 PM.  
OVERALL TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL WITH BELOW NORMAL PRECIPITATION CONTINUING THROUGH THE LONG TERM ENDING SUNDAY.  THE PERIOD STARTS OUT WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY WITH TRANQUIL AND COOL CONDITIONS WITH A DRY WEST-NORTHWEST FLOW REGIME IN PLACE. LOW TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY NIGHT MAY BE COLD ENOUGH FOR FROST IN PARTS OF THE ADIRONDACKS...WHERE THE GROWING SEASON WILL BEGIN.  AN UPPER LEVEL LOW IS FORECAST TO TRACK EASTWARD ACROSS QUEBEC ON FRIDAY...WHICH WILL BE TOO FAR NORTH TO HAVE MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON OUR AREA. HOWEVER...A COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER TROUGH MAY TRIGGER ISOLATED SHOWERS ACROSS THE ADIRONDACKS. MOISTURE LOOKS RATHER LIMITED SO WILL ONLY MENTION SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AT THIS TIME.  HIGH PRESSURE LOOKS TO THEN BUILD IN FOR SATURDAY OF MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AND TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL. THE HIGH SHIFTS SOUTHEAST OF THE AREA ON SUNDAY...INDUCING A SOUTHERLY FLOW BRINGING WARMER AIR INTO THE REGION. SO TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM BACK INTO THE 70S.  
06Z UPDATE... COMPLICATED AVIATION SCENARIO THIS TAF PERIOD...AS A SURFACE TROUGH MOVES IN FROM THE WEST WITH SOME MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY...YET FLOW AROUND HIGH PRESSURE OVER NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND WILL SLIDE FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND MARINE LAYER IN FROM THE EAST LATE TODAY INTO TONIGHT. SQUEEZE PLAY CAUSING LIFT BETWEEN THESE FEATURES...SHOULD YIELD DEVELOPING SHRA-TSRA THIS AFTERNOON...WITH AT LEAST SHRA THIS EVENING AND POSSIBLY STILL EMBEDDED TSRA. BEFORE THEN...FAIRLY MOIST LOW LEVELS WILL ALLOW FOR MVFR MIST DEVELOPMENT DURING REMAINDER OF CURRENT NIGHT UNTIL JUST A LITTLE AFTER DAWN. KELM ALREADY HAS MVFR VIS PRIOR TO 06Z...AND SHOULD BOUNCE IN-AND-OUT OF IFR FOR PREDAWN HOURS UNTIL INCREASING HIGH CLOUDS MITIGATE FURTHER RESTRICTIONS. WINDS WILL FLUCTUATE BETWEEN LIGHT SE/LIGHT SW...EXCEPT FOR ERRATIC GUSTS NEAR CB THIS AFTERNOON. MARINE LAYER WITH FUEL ALT MVFR DECK SHOULD ADVECT INTO KAVP THIS EVENING AND PROBABLY KBGM AS WELL.  
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS DOWN FROM THE CANADIAN MARITIMES INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WATERS. A WARM FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE WEST TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING...AND THEN A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE IS THEN IN CONTROL THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A DRY COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE ON FRIDAY.  
BACKDOOR COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO SAG SOUTH OF LONG ISLAND AND WILL BECOME NEARLY STATIONARY LATER THIS MORNING. MEANWHILE...HIGH PRES OVER THE CANADIAN MARITIMES WILL DROP TO THE SOUTH AND WILL BE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WATERS. THIS WILL SET UP AN ONSHORE FLOW ACROSS THE REGION THAT WILL USHER A COOLER AIRMASS.  ONSHORE FLOW WILL RESULT IN PATCHY FOG THIS MORNING...AND THAT FOG WILL DISSIPATE SHORTLY AFTER SUNRISE. WIDESPREAD STRATUS WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE DAY...WITH OCNL BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS FROM TIME TO TIME WEST OF THE HUDSON RIVER. WITH SE FLOW...TEMPS WILL BE MUCH COLDER TODAY AS COMPARED TO SUNDAY...WITH HIGHS IN THE LOW TO MID 60S ACROSS EASTERN CT...LONG ISLAND...AND ALONG THE COASTS. INTERIOR ZONES WEST OF THE HUDSON RIVER WILL BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER...TOPPING OFF IN THE UPPER 60S TO AROUND 70...DUE TO THE OCNL BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS ALLOWING A BIT MORE SUNSHINE TO FILTER THROUGH.  
A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE TERMINALS FROM EAST TO WEST BY 12Z...RETURNING EAST AS A WARM FRONT TONIGHT.  WIDESPREAD MVFR FOG ALONG WITH PATCHY LIFR DENSE FOG WILL CONTINUE UNTIL AROUND 14Z. LIFR/IFR CIGS WILL CONTINUE MOVING WEST ACROSS CT AND LONG ISLAND...MOVING ACROSS ALL METRO TERMINALS BETWEEN 10Z AND 12Z.  SUB VFR CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST TO LINGER THROUGH THE MORNING PUSH. EXPECT CIGS TO IMPROVE TO HIGH END MVFR DURING THE AFTERNOON.  LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS WILL GIVE WAY TO E WINDS 10-15 KT THROUGH THE DAY...THEN SE AT 5-10 KT TONIGHT.  WIDESPREAD DENSE FOG IS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE REGION AFTER SUNSET WHICH WILL CONTINUE THRU THE NIGHT. STAY TUNED.  
WEDNESDAY.  
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...BROAD/FLAT UPPER LEVEL TROUGHING OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND NORTHEAST WILL REAMPLIFY AS A PAIR OF SHORTWAVES DROP THROUGH ITS BACKSIDE AND BASE...WITH AN ATTENDANT SECONDARY COLD FRONT PIVOTING ACROSS OUR REGION BETWEEN THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. AT THIS JUNCTURE...THIS LATTER FEATURE STILL APPEARS TO BE TOO WEAK AND STARVED FOR BOTH MOISTURE AND UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT TO WARRANT THE INCLUSION OF ANY PRECIP CHANCES IN THE FORECAST...SO HAVE CONTINUED TO LEAVE THINGS DRY WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AND DRIER AIR CONTINUING TO DOMINATE OUR WEATHER. IN ADVANCE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED FRONT...SOME MODEST WARMING OF OUR AIRMASS SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO RECOVER BACK INTO THE LOWER AND MID 60S ON THURSDAY...BEFORE PULLING BACK AT LEAST A LITTLE BEHIND THE BOUNDARY ON FRIDAY.  NEXT WEEKEND...SPRAWLING HIGH PRESSURE AND DRY AIR OVER OUR REGION AT THE START OF SATURDAY WILL SLOWLY DRIFT EASTWARD AND OFF THE ATLANTIC COASTLINE...WHILE HEIGHTS ALOFT ALSO REBUILD AS THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER OUR REGION LIFTS OUT...AND THE NEXT MODEST TROUGH BEGINS SLIDING EASTWARD ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES. UNDER THIS REGIME...DRY WEATHER SHOULD PERSIST THROUGH AT LEAST THE FIRST HALF OF SUNDAY...BEFORE AN APPROACHING WARM FRONT OVER THE OHIO VALLEY POTENTIALLY BRINGS A RISK OF SHOWERS SUNDAY AFTERNOON. THIS STATED...HAVE ELECTED TO KEEP THINGS DRY ON SUNDAY FOR NOW GIVEN BOTH THE DISTANT VANTAGE POINT AND THE LACK OF AGREEMENT EXHIBITED BY THE MEDIUM RANGE GUIDANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE TIMING OF THE WARM FRONT...WHICH IS TYPICAL FOR THIS FAR IN ADVANCE. WHAT IS MORE CERTAIN IS THAT THIS PATTERN SHOULD ALLOW FOR A WARMING TREND...WITH DAYTIME HIGHS CLIMBING BACK INTO THE 70S BY NEXT SUNDAY.  
AS OF 415 AM EDT MONDAY...QUITE A BIT OF VARIABILITY IN TEMPERATURES TODAY WITH SOUTH WINDS BRINGING WARM AIR TO NORTHERN NEW YORK AND CHAMPLAIN VALLEY, WHILE BACK DOOR FRONT KEEPS EASTERN VERMONT COOLER WITH MORE CLOUDS.  SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER MAINE WILL KEEP EASTERLY FLOW OFF THE GULF OF MAINE ACROSS NH INTO EASTERN VERMONT. AS OF EARLY MORNING DIFFICULT TO PICK OUT BACK DOOR FRONT LOCATION AS ALL TEMPS ACROSS THE REGION IN THE 50S. HOWEVER SURFACE OBS SHOWING EXTENT OF MOIST MARINE LAYER EVIDENT IN LOW OVERCAST BELOW 1500 FT NOT QUITE REACHING CONNECTICUT RIVER VALLEY. ELSEWHERE NEARLY CALM WINDS AND HIGH THIN CLOUDS WITH PATCHES OF LIGHT FOG. SOUTHERLY FLOW TO DEVELOP TODAY IN CHAMPLAIN VALLEY AND NORTHERN NY IN ADVANCE OF APPROACHING SURFACE LOW. UPPER RIDGE CRESTS OVER REGION DURING THE DAY AND SHIFTS EAST BY THE END OF THE PERIOD ALLOWING FOR CHANCE FOR SHOWERS IN ST. LAWRENCE COUNTY.  TEMPS IN ST. LAWRENCE VALLEY TO REACH THE MID 80S...WITH 70S ELSEWHERE AND EASTERN VERMONT ONLY IN THE 60S. MARINE LAYER IS SHALLOW AND DO NOT EXPECT IT TO BECOME BLOCKED BY THE GREEN MOUNTAINS AND REMAIN IN EASTERN VT. SOUTHERLY FLOW UP THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY WILL ALSO KEEP ANY MARINE INVERSION MIXED OUT AS WELL. WINDS TO INCREASE TO 15 TO 25 KTS.  
AS OF 415 AM EDT MONDAY...LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM APPROACHING FROMT THE WEST WILL GENERATE SOUTHERLY WINDS DURING THE DAY TODAY. SOUTH WINDS 5-10 KNOTS IN THE MORNING WILL INCREASE IN SPEED IN THE AFTERNOONT AND REACH LAKE WIND ADVISORY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON. SOUTH WINDS 15-25 KNOTS TO CONTINUE OVERNIGHT AND INTO TUESDAY, UNTIL THE COLD FRONT PASSES AROUND MID DAY TUESDAY AND WIND SHIFTS TO WEST. WAVES LESS THAN A FOOT THIS MORNING WILL BUILD ALONG WITH THE WIND THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.  
A FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON INTO TUESDAY...BRINGING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO MUCH OF NY AND PA. MUCH COOLER TEMPERATURES WILL FOLLOW FOR MIDWEEK.  
725 PM UPDATE... FORECAST UPDATED FOR LATEST OBS/TRENDS INCLUDING THE QUICK DISSIPATION OF CLOUD COVER THE LAST FEW HOURS. LIMITED INSTABILITY IN VICINITY OF WASHED OUT STATIONARY FRONT IN THE WYOMING VALLEY...ONLY MUSTERED A COUPLE ISOLATED SHOWERS AND NOW EVEN THOSE ARE FALLING APART WITH LOSS OF HEATING. QUIET NIGHT FORESEEN WITH PATCHY FOG AND LOWS MAINLY UPPER 50S-LOW 60S...AND SOME INCREASING CLOUDS LATE.  PREVIOUS DISCUSSION... STATIONARY FRONT WILL MOVE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT ON MONDAY AFTERNOON, SPREADING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE FA. STRONG TEMPERATURE GRADIENT WILL ENHANCE LIFT, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR THE FINGER LAKES REGION TO PUSH INTO THE MID/UPPER 80S BY AFTERNOON. MLCAPE IS MODEST, WITH FORECAST VALUES OF 500-1000 J/KG. 0-6KM SHEAR ALSO MARGINAL AT 20 TO 25 KNOTS. THUS THINK THUNDERSTORMS WILL NOT ORGANIZE, AND THE MAIN THREAT WILL BE FROM HEAVY DOWNPOURS AND TRAINING CELLS. THIS CONCERN IS SUPPORTED BY PWAT VALUES BETWEEN 1.60" AND 1.90" AND A WIND FIELD CONDUCIVE TO TRAINING.  STILL SOME MINOR DISAGREEMENTS ON TIMING OF COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE ON TUESDAY. LATEST RUNS SUGGEST THE MORE STABLE AIR BEHIND THE FRONT HOLDS OFF THROUGH THE AFTERNOON, SO KEPT MENTION OF THUNDER THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY. HOWEVER, ATMOSPHERE WILL BE WORKED OVER TO A LARGE DEGREE, AND INSTABILITY MAY BE BELOW MODEL PROGS AS A RESULT.  
A VERY QUIET PD WITH A WNW FLOW ALOFT AND BLDG SFC HIPRES. THIS WILL RESULT IN GNRLY DRY AND SLGTY COOLER THAN NRML WX FOR THE LONG TERM. ONLY REAL WX ITEM TO DISCUSS IS A SCNDRY COLD FNT SLIDING INTO NEW ENG ON FRI WHICH PTNLY COULD TRIGGER A FEW SHWRS OVER THE ERN AREAS FRI AFNT. HAVE GONE WITH THE DRY HPC GUID FOR NOW BUT THIS PSBLTY CANNOT BE RULED OUT. BEYOND THAT...A LRG SFC BLDS IN BHD THE FNT AND DRY AND COOL WX WILL CONT THRU THE END OF THE PD...AND BEYOND.  
A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE TERMINALS FROM EAST TO WEST BY SUNRISE...RETURNING EAST AS A WARM FRONT MONDAY NIGHT.  MVFR FOG CONTS TO DEVELOP RAPIDLY ACROSS THE AREA WITH ISOLATED PATCHES OF LIFR DENSE FOG.  LIFR/IFR CIGS AND FOG CONTINUE MOVING WEST ACROSS SE CT AND EASTERN LONG ISLAND AND SHOULD ARRIVE AT ALL METRO TERMINALS BETWEEN 09Z AND 11Z.  SUB VFR CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST TO LINGER THROUGH THE MONDAY MORNING PUSH...AND EXPECT CEILINGS TO IMPROVE TO HIGH END MVFR DURING THE AFTERNOON.  LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS WILL GIVE WAY TO A DEVELOPING E/NE WIND LATE TONIGHT AFTER THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH. EAST WINDS CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY MONDAY AT AROUND 10 KT.  WIDESPREAD DENSE FOG IS POSSIBLE MAINLY EAST OF NYC AFTER SUNSET WHICH WILL CONTINUE THRU THE NIGHT. STAY TUNED.  
AND/OR SHRA/TSTM. 
A WARM AND HUMID AIR MASS WILL REMAIN OVER THE REGION WITH A PERIOD OF THUNDERSTORMS PUSHING ACROSS WESTERN AND CENTRAL NEW YORK TODAY AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT. SOME OF THESE THUNDERSTORMS MAY BRING LOCALIZED HEAVY RAIN AND GUSTY WINDS. THE FRONT WILL CROSS EARLY TUESDAY THEN A COOLER AND DRIER AIRMASS WILL ARRIVE BEHIND THE FRONT FOR THE MID WEEK PERIOD.  
MUGGY AIRMASS WILL REMAIN IN PLACE EARLY THIS MORNING WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 60S ACROSS WESTERN NEW YORK TO THE MID 50S FOR THE NORTH COUNTRY. THIS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE COMBINED WITH LIGHT WINDS WILL CONTINUE THE POTENTIAL FOR AREAS OF FOG OVERNIGHT MAINLY OVER THE COOLER LAKES AND ALONG THE LAKESHORES.  A DEEP LAYER SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL REMAIN FIRMLY IN PLACE ACROSS THE LOWER LAKES TODAY. THE REGION WILL BE LARGELY OUTSIDE THE MAIN HEIGHT FALL CENTER AND ASSOCIATED UPPER JET CORE ATTENDANT TO THE CLOSED LOW MEANDERING ACROSS THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES. ANY EARLY DAY STRATUS DEBRIS WILL GET MIXED OUT INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD FOR SEEING A GOOD BIT OF SUN BY THE MIDDAY PERIOD. THIS SHOULD YIELD A SOLID DIURNAL TEMPERATURE RESPONSE WITH HIGHS MAKING A DECENT RUN AT THE LOWER TO MID 80S...ESPECIALLY ACROSS INTERIOR SECTIONS OF THE GENESEE VALLEY AND FINGER LAKES.  COLD FRONTAL TIMING LOOKS TO BE CENTERED ON TUESDAY MORNING. THEREFORE WE WILL LOOK FOR A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AND LAKE BREEZE CONVERGENCE TO CAPITALIZE UPON WHAT SHOULD BE A MODERATELY UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT WITH MLCAPES NEARING 2000 J/KG DURING PEAK HEATING. EXPECTING THE BEST CHANCES OF STORMS TO DEVELOP INLAND OF THE LAKES FROM EAST OF BUFFALO TO ROCHESTER AND SYRACUSE. STABLE SOUTHWEST FLOW OFF LAKE ERIE SHOULD KEEP BUFFALO SHIELDED FROM ANY STORMS THIS AFTERNOON.  IT APPEARS THAT THE STRONGER MID LEVEL WIND FIELDS WILL RESIDE BEHIND THE FRONT...KEEPING SHEAR PROFILES RATHER WEAK. THIS WILL BRING THE POTENTIAL FOR SLOW MOVING CELLS AND LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINFALL...ESPECIALLY IF ANY TRAINING CELLS EMERGE. CAN NOT RULE OUT SOME GUSTY STORMS WITH SMALL HAIL IF STORM TOPS CAN GROW TALL ENOUGH. A MARGINAL RISK FOR SEVERE STORMS EXISTS TODAY.  
DURING THE COURSE OF MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...ELONGATED LOW PRESSURE INITIALLY DRAPED ACROSS EASTERN ONTARIO AND QUEBEC PROVINCES WILL CONSOLIDATE A BIT AS IT DRIFTS TOWARD THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY. IN THE PROCESS...THIS FEATURE WILL PUSH ITS ATTENDANT PREFRONTAL TROUGH/ PSEUDO-WARM FRONT FROM CENTRAL NEW YORK TO CENTRAL NEW ENGLAND MONDAY NIGHT...BEFORE SWEEPING ITS TRAILING COLD FRONT ACROSS THE REGION BETWEEN LATE MONDAY NIGHT AND THE EARLY-TO-MIDDLE PORTION OF TUESDAY AFTERNOON.  AN ONGOING SWATH OF CONVECTION ALONG THE PREFRONTAL TROUGH ACROSS THE FINGER LAKES AND NORTH COUNTRY AT THE START OF MONDAY EVENING WILL SHIFT EASTWARD ALONG WITH THE BOUNDARY WHILE WEAKENING WITH THE LOSS OF HEATING AND DIMINISHING INSTABILITY MONDAY NIGHT. IN SPITE OF GRADUALLY IMPROVING WIND PROFILES/SHEAR LEVELS MONDAY NIGHT...THE WEAKENING INSTABILITY SHOULD PRECLUDE ANY REAL ORGANIZED THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS...WHILE ANY LINGERING POTENTIAL FOR LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINS ALSO SHOULD TEND TO DIMINISH WITH TIME AS WINDS PICK UP ALOFT. FURTHER WEST...THE COMBINATION OF RELATIVELY DRIER AIR IN THE WAKE OF THE PREFRONTAL TROUGH AND LESSER AMOUNTS OF INSTABILITY SHOULD TRANSLATE INTO MUCH LOWER CHANCES OF CONVECTION MONDAY NIGHT...THOUGH SOME SCATTERED SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY STILL CANNOT BE TOTALLY RULED OUT...ESPECIALLY EARLY ON AND AGAIN LATER IN THE NIGHT AS THE SURFACE COLD FRONT BEGINS TO CROSS THE REGION. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN RATHER MILD...WITH OVERNIGHT LOWS MOSTLY IN THE LOWER 60S.  BY THE START OF TUESDAY MORNING...THE SURFACE COLD FRONT SHOULD BE LOCATED IN THE VICINITY OF THE GENESEE VALLEY. LINGERING CHANCES FOR SCATTERED CONVECTION ALONG AND TO THE EAST OF THIS BOUNDARY WILL DIMINISH THROUGH THE EARLY TO MID AFTERNOON HOURS AS THE FRONT PRESSES ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF OUR REGION...WITH DRY WEATHER THEN FOLLOWING IN ITS WAKE. GIVEN THE EXPECTED TIMING OF THE FRONT...AT THIS POINT THE BEST INSTABILITY /AND POTENTIAL FOR NOTEWORTHY CONVECTION ALONG IT/ LOOKS TO LIE A BIT TO OUR EAST OVER CENTRAL AND EASTERN NEW YORK. OTHERWISE...DEVELOPING COLD AIR ADVECTION BEHIND THE FRONT WILL RESULT IN NOTICEABLY COOLER AND LESS HUMID CONDITIONS COMPARED TO THOSE OF MONDAY...WITH HIGHS GENERALLY RANGING FROM THE MID AND UPPER 60S ACROSS FAR WESTERN NEW YORK TO THE LOWER AND MID 70S FROM THE GENESEE VALLEY EASTWARD...AND DEWPOINTS DROPPING OFF TO THE 45-50F RANGE.  TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THE FIRST PART OF WEDNESDAY...A VIGOROUS SHORTWAVE WILL SLIDE ACROSS SOUTHERN ONTARIO AND QUEBEC. COUPLED WITH A MODEST INCREASE IN MOISTURE...THIS FEATURE COULD PRODUCE AN ADDITIONAL STRAY SHOWER OR TWO ACROSS THE NORTH COUNTRY AND SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY LATER TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY MORNING...WHILE THE REMAINDER OF THE REGION JUST EXPERIENCES AN INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER. ONCE THIS FEATURE GOES BY... HIGH PRESSURE AND DRIER AIR SHOULD BUILD ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH THE BALANCE OF THE PERIOD...BRINGING A RETURN TO DRY WEATHER AREAWIDE ALONG WITH SOME PARTIAL CLEARING.  REGARDING TEMPERATURES...CONTINUED GOOD COLD AIR ADVECTION TUESDAY NIGHT WILL SEND 850 MB READINGS DOWN TO A LITTLE BELOW FREEZING BY WEDNESDAY MORNING...BEFORE THE COOLER AIRMASS BEGINS TO SLOWLY MODIFY DURING THE COURSE OF WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL RESULT IN SURFACE READINGS DROPPING BACK INTO THE LOWER HALF OF THE 40S TUESDAY NIGHT... THEN STRUGGLING TO GET MUCH ABOVE THE MID 50S ON WEDNESDAY. THE COLDEST OVERALL READINGS OF THE PERIOD LOOK TO COME WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHEN LESSER AMOUNTS OF CLOUD COVER AND LIGHTER WINDS SHOULD ALLOW FOR OVERNIGHT LOWS TO FALL INTO THE UPPER 30S AND LOWER 40S.  
VFR CONDITIONS IN PLACE EARLY THIS MORNING EXCEPT FOR SOME MVFR FOG AT KJHW AND KART. THIS WILL WILL DISSIPATE IN THE MORNING WITH INCREASING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE LATE MORNING AND AFTERNOON AS A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH CROSSES THE FORECAST AREA. A STABLE FLOW OFF LAKE ERIE SHOULD KEEP KBUF/KIAG FREE FROM ANY HEAVY STORMS WHICH WILL DEVELOP FROM THE SOUTHERN TIER TO EAST OF BUFFALO TO ROCHESTER AND SYRACUSE. STORM ACTIVITY WILL SHIFT EAST LATER THIS EVENING WITH MAINLY DRY CONDITIONS EXPECTED TONIGHT.  OUTLOOK...  TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...VFR.  
LIGHT WINDS AND MINIMAL WAVES WILL CONTINUE ON THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES WITH AREAS OF FOG AS A WARM AND HUMID AIRMASS REMAINS OVER THE COOL LAKE WATERS.  CONDITIONS ON THE LAKES SHOULD REMAIN QUIET OUTSIDE OF ANY FOG AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS PRODUCING ASSOCIATED HIGHER WINDS AND WAVES TODAY.  A COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP ACROSS THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES LATE TONIGHT/TUESDAY WITH AN INCREASE IN WIND SPEED AND WAVE ACTION INTO TUESDAY. SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES MAY BE NEEDED.  
NY...NONE. MARINE...NONE.  
A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT PUSHES SOUTHWEST THROUGH THE AREA TONIGHT...FOLLOWED BY HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING DOWN FROM THE CANADIAN MARITIMES THROUGH MONDAY. A WARM FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE WEST MONDAY NIGHT AS THE HIGH BEGINS TO RETREAT TO THE NORTHEAST. A WARM FRONT WILL LIFT THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING...FOLLOWED BY A COLD FRONT TUESDAY EVENING. HIGH PRESSURE IS THEN IN CONTROL THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A WEAK COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE ON FRIDAY.  
FOG/STRATUS DEVELOPING OVER SE CT AND THE TWIN FORKS OF LONG ISLAND...AND THAT WILL SPREAD TO THE WEST DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. BACKDOOR COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO DROP TO THE SOUTH THROUGH THE REGION...AND TEMPS WILL CONTINUE TO FALL AS WELL.  PATCHY DRIZZLE WILL DEVELOP TOWARDS DAYBREAK AS WELL.  LOWS WILL DROP INTO THE LOW TO MID 50S FOR EASTERN ZONES AND IN THE LOW 60S FOR THE WESTERN ZONES.  
SHOULD SEE ANY PATCHY FOG/DRIZZLE DISSIPATE BY MID MORNING...EXCEPT MAYBE UPSLOPE FLOW REGIONS IN HIGHER TERRAIN TO THE W OF NYC. DO EXPECT CLOUDS TO BREAK UP AT LEAST SOMEWHAT FROM E TO W AS DRIER LOW LEVEL AIR WORKS IN FROM THE NE AND 850-500 HPA RIDGE AXIS BUILDS OVER THE AREA. SUBSIDENCE UNDER THIS RIDGE SHOULD KEEP ANY MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION AT BAY DURING THE DAYLIGHT HOURS.  FOR HIGHS MONDAY USED A BLEND OF MIXING DOWN FROM 975-950 HPA PER BUFKIT SOUNDINGS WITH NAM 2-METER TEMPERATURES AND A BLEND OF MAV/MET/ECS GUIDANCE. HIGHS SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL.  INCREASING ISENTROPIC LIFT FROM W TO E COUPLED WITH INCREASING LOW LEVEL INSTABILITY FROM W TO E...BASED ON SHOWALTER INDICES DECREASING TO AROUND 0...BRINGS MAINLY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS TO THE NW 1/2 OF THE CWA MONDAY EVENING...THEN LIKELY SHOWERS W/CHANCE SHOWERS E WITH PATCHY FOG LATE MONDAY NIGHT.  FOR LOWS MONDAY NIGHT USED A BLEND OF NAM 2-METER TEMPERATURES WITH ECS/MET/MAV GUIDANCE. LOWS SHOULD BE AROUND 5 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL.  
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE H5 PATTERN THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. SLIGHT DIFFERENCES COME INTO PLAY WITH TIMING AND AMPLITUDE OF A SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING THROUGH NEW ENGLAND ON WED...ALTHOUGH SHOWER/TSTM ACTIVITY CURRENTLY LOOKS TO REMAIN TO OUR N. A VORTEX DEVELOPS OVER SE CANADA AT THE END OF THE WEEK WITH ZONAL FLOW BECOMING SW ALOFT AS A PIECE OF ENERGY MOVING AROUND THE BASE RESULTS IN AMPLIFICATION. THE TROUGH SLIDES EAST ON SATURDAY WITH DEEP LAYERED RIDGING BUILDING TOWARDS THE AREA.  AT THE SFC...A WARM FRONT LIFTS THROUGH TUE MORNING WITH SHOWERS LIKELY. MAINTAINED NO MENTION OF THUNDER AS SHOWALTER VALUES INCREASE DURING THE MORNING RESULTING IN DECREASING INSTABILITY ALOFT.  NOT EXPECTING MUCH SUN ON TUE AS WITH A COLD FRONT APPROACHING...ALTHOUGH HIGH SHOULD BE NEAR TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL LEVELS. COLD FRONT PASSES IN THE EVE WITH SHOWERS... POSSIBLY A FEW RUMBLES OF THUNDER PRECEDING IT IN THE AFTERNOON. SOUNDINGS TODAY ARE SHOWING A CAPPING INVERSION AROUND H95. IF THIS TREND CONTINUES...THUNDER WILL NEED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE FORECAST.  HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS IN FROM THE W AND REMAINS IN CONTROL THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAYBE A SHOWER ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK COLD FRONT DROPPING THROUGH THE AREA ON FRI AFTERNOON/EVE. GFS IS THE ONLY MODEL INDICATING THIS AND HAS MORE MOISTURE THAN THE OTHERS...SO KEPT IT DRY.  TEMPERATURES WILL GENERALLY BE NEAR TO ABOVE NORMAL LEVELS THROUGH THE PERIOD.  
LIGHT FLOW TONIGHT...WILL GIVE WAY TO E WINDS UP TO 15KT MONDAY/MONDAY EVENING...BEFORE DIMINISHING BACK TO 10 KT OR LESS. AT THIS TIME THOUGH IT APPEARS GUSTS AND SEAS WILL STAY BELOW SCA LEVELS TONIGHT-MONDAY NIGHT.  SUB-SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY WITH A RELATIVELY LIGHT FLOW PERSISTING ACROSS THE AREA. GUSTS MAY REACH AROUND 20 KT LATE TUE NIGHT INTO WED NIGHT AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHTENS BETWEEN LOW PRES TO THE NE AND HIGH PRES BUILDING IN FROM THE W.  
FROM ONE TO THREE TENTHS OF AN INCH OF RAIN IS POSSIBLE FROM LATE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING. LITTLE OR NO HYDROLOGIC IMPACT IS EXPECTED.  NO PRECIPITATION IS THEN EXPECTED THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK.  
THE WEAK COLD FRONT JUST SOUTH OF THE REGION WILL RETURN NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT DURING MONDAY. THIS WILL INCREASE BOTH THE CLOUD COVER AND THE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. A STRONGER COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO MOVE ACROSS THE REGION ON TUESDAY WITH ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.  
AS OF 1030 PM EDT...QUIET NIGHT WITH A CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKY. THE WIND HAS BECOME CALM IN MANY AREAS...AND TEMPERATURES HAVE DROPPED QUITE A BIT FROM BEFORE...GENERALLY DOWN INTO THE 60S...EXCEPT LOWER 70S IN THE MID HUDSON VALLEY WHERE DEWPOINTS HAVE SURGED INTO THE 60S.  FOR THIS UPDATE...LEFT LOW TEMPERATURES ALONE. HOWEVER...DECIDED TO ADD PATCHY FOG ACROSS THE BOARD SINCE TEMPERATURES HAVE DROPPED QUITE A BIT...AND DEWPOINTS WERE CREEPING UPWARD.  OVERNIGHT...AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES OFF SHORE...AND A BOUNDARY LURKING TO OUR SOUTH...THERE ARE SIGNALS THAT STRATUS COULD FORM SOUTH OF LONG ISLAND AND THEN COULD MOVE NORTH UP THE HUDSON VALLEY AND AREAS EAST OF THE HUDSON VALLEY...POSSIBLY TO JUST SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL REGION BY DAYBREAK. IF THIS HAPPENED...WE MIGHT HAVE TO ADJUST LOWS A LITTLE UPWARD BUT FOR NOW...THEY LOOK REASONABLE AND WERE LEFT ALONE. LOOK FOR LOWS GENERALLY IN THE 50S...CLOSER TO 60 IN THE CAPITAL REGION.  
MONDAY...THE AFOREMENTIONED SURFACE HIGH ALONG THE MAINE COASTLINE WILL EXTEND ITS INFLUENCE FURTHER WEST ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION. A SCT-BKN MARINE LAYER STRATUS DECK IS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 1/3RD OF THE REGION AND LOW LEVEL SOUTHEAST FLOW BECOMES A BIT MORE ENHANCED. THIS TOO WILL BE A FACTOR OF THE UPSTREAM CYCLONE APPROACHING THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES REGION FURTHER ENHANCING THE AGEOSTROPHIC FLOW. MEANWHILE THE UPPER RIDGE AXIS WILL MIGRATE FURTHER EAST THROUGH THE DAY AND AS THE CYCLONE FURTHER TRACKS INTO THE CENTRAL GREAT LAKES REGION. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR MOISTURE TO QUICKLY ADVECT NORTHWARD WITH ELEVATED SHOWERS AND EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ALONG AND WEST OF I81 CORRIDOR THEN MIGRATING EASTWARD INTO OUR WESTERN ZONES DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. DUE TO THE ELEVATED NATURE OF THESE CELLS...NOT EXPECTING SEVERE WEATHER AT THIS TIME. DUE TO THE INCREASE IN CLOUD COVERAGE...TEMPERATURES MONDAY WILL BE A BIT COOLER THAN SUNDAY WITH MAINLY 60S FOR THE TERRAIN AND 70S FOR VALLEY LOCATIONS.  MONDAY NIGHT...NCEP MODEL SUITE IS IN RATHER GOOD AGREEMENT WITH UPSTREAM APPROACH OF THE PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AXIS AND DEEPENING MOISTURE PROFILES. PWATS IN EXCESS OF 1.50 INCHES ARE PROGGED SO THE POTENTIAL FOR MODERATE TO HEAVY RAINFALL WILL EXIST. AS DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS NARROW...SO WILL VISIBILITIES AS WE WILL PLACE PATCHY FOG IN THE GRIDS FOR THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD AS LOWS WILL BE MILD...MAINLY BETWEEN 55F-65F.  TUESDAY...THIS WILL BE THE MAIN CHALLENGE OF THIS FORECAST AS IT WILL BE A RACE BETWEEN THE PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED PRECIP AND THE APPROACH OF THE MAIN COLD FRONT DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. IF WE ARE ABLE TO ATTAIN SEVERAL BREAKS IN THE OVERCAST...WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR A MORE SIGNIFICANT THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT /AS SUGGESTED BY THE SWODY3 FROM SPC/. MODELS ARE IN RATHER GOOD AGREEMENT WITH EXITING THE TROUGH AND PRECIP WITH SURFACE LAYER RECOVERING TO OUR WEST. SBCAPES FROM THE NCEP MODELS SUGGEST VALUES CLIMB TO BETWEEN 1-2K J/KG WITH 0-6KM SHEAR OF 30-40KTS. FORECAST BUFR PROFILES DO SUGGEST RATHER LOW LCL/S YET THE HODOGRAPHS ARE MORE STRAIGHT AND LINEAR. WE WILL PLACE CHC-SCT POPS FOR CONVECTION AT THIS TIME WITH NEAR TO ABOVE SEASONABLE TEMPERATURES.  TUESDAY NIGHT...STRENGTHENING COLD ADVECTION IN THE WAKE OF THE COLD FROPA WITH A BRISK WEST-NORTHWEST WINDS. MODELS ARE SUGGESTING AMPLE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AROUND H850 TO STREAM DOWN FROM LAKE ONTARIO AND WITH UPSLOPE CONDITIONS FOR SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS POSSIBLE. H850 TEMPS TOWARD SUNRISE ARE EXPECTED TO RANGE FROM ZERO TO -2C FROM ALBANY AND POINTS WEST AND NORTHWEST WITH LOWER POSITIVE SINGLE DIGITS SOUTH AND EAST OF ALBANY.  
IT STILL LOOKS AS IF WEDNESDAY WILL BE A BRISK DAY AS A STEEP PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL EXIST BETWEEN A DEPARTING DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE OVER EASTERN CANADA...AND LARGE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING SOUTH FROM HUDSON BAY. H850 TEMPERATURES WILL BE BETWEEN 0 NORTH AND ABOUT +3C SOUTH AS ARCTIC AIR GETS PULLED SOUTH.  THERE COULD BE A FEW SHOWERS ACROSS THE ADIRONDACKS...BUT NOTHING MORE THAN SPRINKLES ANYWHERE ELSE. IT WILL BE VARIABLY CLOUDY...WITH MORE SUNSHINE TO THE LEE OF THE CATSKILLS. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL ONLY BE IN THE LOWER TO MID 60S ACROSS THE VALLEYS...50S HIGHER TERRAIN.  WEDNESDAY NIGHT WILL CONTINUE TO BE BREEZY IN MOST PLACES...THEREFORE WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY FROST. STILL...IT WILL BE COOL UNDER A CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKY AND LOWS LOWER TO MID 40S VALLEYS...UPPER 30S HIGHER TERRAIN.  THURSDAY WILL NOT BE AS BREEZY OR COOL AS WEDNESDAY HAS H850 TEMPERATURES WARM UP A LITTLE BIT AND FLOW BECOMES MORE ANTICYLONIC WHILE THE PRESSURE GRADIENT RELAXES. WITH MORE SUNSHINE AND THE SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPERATURES ALOFT...LOOK FOR HIGHS TO RECOVER TO AROUND 70 IN THE VALLEYS...MAINLY 60S ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN.  FRIDAY...ANOTHER TROUGH WILL SWING BY TO OUR NORTH. WHILE MOST ENERGY AND FORCING SHOULD STAY NORTH...THERE COULD BE A FEW MORE CLOUDS AND PERHAPS A SPRINKLE ACROSS OUR NORTHERN AREAS. FOR NOW...THE THREAT OF ANY MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION WAS TOO LOW TO INCLUDE OUR EXTENDED FORECAST.  OTHERWISE IT WILL BE A LITTLE BREEZY AND PARTLY SUNNY. TEMPERATURES WILL RANGE FROM THE LOWER TO MID 70S SOUTH OF ALBANY IN THE HUDSON VALLEY...CLOSER TO 70 IN AND AROUND THE CAPITAL REGION....COOLER...MID 50S TO MID 60S NORTH OF THE CAPITAL REGION...WITH THE COOLEST READINGS ACROSS THE ADIRONDACKS.  LARGE HIGH PRESSURE IS FORECAST BY ALL THE LONG RANGE MODELS TO BUILD FOR THE START OF THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND. THIS LOOKS TO PROVIDE A LOT OF SUNSHINE BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL MODERATE EACH DAY...LOWER TO MID 70S VALLEYS SATURDAY FOR HIGHS...60S HIGHER TERRAIN. SUNDAY WILL SEE HIGHS IN THE 70S ACROSS THE ENTIRE REGION...WITH SOME SPOTS SOUTH OF ALBANY IN THE HUDSON VALLEY MAKING A RUN AT 80.  
NOTE...MOST OF OUR REGION HAS OFFICIALLY BEEN DECLARED "GREENED-UP" EXCLUDING THE ADIRONDACKS...NORTHERN TACONICS...SOUTHERN VERMONT AND THE CATSKILLS  MOISTURE WILL INCREASE THROUGH TUESDAY WITH MODERATE TO PERHAPS HEAVY RAINFALL MONDAY NIGHT. AS GREEN UP IS UNDERWAY...THIS TOO WILL FURTHER LIMIT FIRE WEATHER RELATED CONCERNS.  THE RH VALUES WILL RECOVER TO 85 TO 100 PERCENT TONIGHT WITH SOME DEW FORMATION. EXPECT THE RH VALUES TO LOWER TO 45 TO 60 PERCENT MONDAY AFTERNOON THEN WET WEATHER MONDAY NIGHT.  THE WINDS WILL BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE TONIGHT. THE WINDS WILL BE FROM THE SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH AT 5 TO 15 MPH ON MONDAY.  
NO WIDESPREAD HYDRO PROBLEMS ARE EXPECTED THE NEXT 5 DAYS.  DRY WEATHER WILL PERSIST TODAY INTO EARLY MONDAY. CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INCREASE LATE MONDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH TUESDAY. MOST OF THE HYDRO SERVICE AREA COULD GET A QUARTER TO HALF INCH OF RAINFALL...BUT LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS ARE POSSIBLE IN THUNDERSTORMS. DRY CONDITIONS WILL RETURN FOR THE MID WEEK PERIOD THROUGH THE END THE WEEK.  FOR DETAILS ON SPECIFIC AREA RIVERS AND LAKES...INCLUDING OBSERVED AND FORECAST RIVER STAGES AND LAKE ELEVATIONS...PLEASE VISIT THE ADVANCED HYDROLOGIC PREDICTION SERVICE /AHPS/ GRAPHS ON OUR WEBSITE.  
IT WILL BE QUIET OVERNIGHT WITH PATCHY FOG. A FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION MONDAY AFTERNOON INTO TUESDAY...BRINGING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO MUCH OF NY AND PA.  
725 PM UPDATE... FORECAST UPDATED FOR LATEST OBS/TRENDS INCLUDING THE QUICK DISSIPATION OF CLOUD COVER THE LAST FEW HOURS. LIMITED INSTABILITY IN VICINITY OF WASHED OUT STATIONARY FRONT IN THE WYOMING VALLEY...ONLY MUSTERED A COUPLE ISOLATED SHOWERS AND NOW EVEN THOSE ARE FALLING APART WITH LOSS OF HEATING. QUIET NIGHT FORESEEN WITH PATCHY FOG AND LOWS MAINLY UPPER 50S-LOW 60S...AND SOME INCREASING CLOUDS LATE.  
STATIONARY FRONT WILL MOVE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT ON MONDAY AFTERNOON, SPREADING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE FA. STRONG TEMPERATURE GRADIENT WILL ENHANCE LIFT, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR THE FINGER LAKES REGION TO PUSH INTO THE MID/UPPER 80S BY AFTERNOON. MLCAPE IS MODEST, WITH FORECAST VALUES OF 500-1000 J/KG. 0-6KM SHEAR ALSO MARGINAL AT 20 TO 25 KNOTS. THUS THINK THUNDERSTORMS WILL NOT ORGANIZE, AND THE MAIN THREAT WILL BE FROM HEAVY DOWNPOURS AND TRAINING CELLS. THIS CONCERN IS SUPPORTED BY PWAT VALUES BETWEEN 1.60" AND 1.90" AND A WIND FIELD CONDUCIVE TO TRAINING.  STILL SOME MINOR DISAGREEMENTS ON TIMING OF COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE ON TUESDAY. LATEST RUNS SUGGEST THE MORE STABLE AIR BEHIND THE FRONT HOLDS OFF THROUGH THE AFTERNOON, SO KEPT MENTION OF THUNDER THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY. HOWEVER, ATMOSPHERE WILL BE WORKED OVER TO A LARGE DEGREE, AND INSTABILITY MAY BE BELOW MODEL PROGS AS A RESULT.  MUCH COOLER AND DRY FOR WEDNESDAY WITH MAX TEMPS STRUGGLING TO REACH 60F.  
A WEAK RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL GIVE WAY TO A BACK DOOR COLD FRONT THIS EVENING LEADING TO A VARIETY OF MAX TEMPS TOMORROW BEFORE AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT PASSING THROUGH THE REGION BRINGS A GOOD CHANCE FOR RAIN MONDAY NIGHT. BEHIND THE COLD FRONT A DEEP LAYER TROUGH AND BROAD SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL SET IN CAUSING TEMPS TO BE BELOW NORMAL FOR MOST OF THE LATE WEEK.  
AS OF 1253 AM EDT MONDAY...GOING FORECAST REMAINS IN GOOD SHAPE. BACK DOOR FRONT FORECAST TO CONTINUE TO MOVE WESTWARD MOVE UP TO ABOUT THE SPINE OF THE GREEN MOUNTAINS. WIND SHIFT MAY PROPAGATE INTO THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY BUT COOLER TEMPERATURES SHOULD REMAIN GREENS/EAST. MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES WILL BE THE RULE FOR MOST...EXCEPT SOME LOWER CLOUDS SPREADING INTO PARTS OF EASTERN VERMONT OVERNIGHT W/ BACKDOOR FRONT. LOOKING AT LOWS GENERALLY 45-55F.  
AS OF 346 PM EDT SUNDAY...LATE MONDAY THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO GIVE WAY TO AN APPROACHING COLD FROM THE WEST. BY NOON THE CENTER OF THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BE CROSSING OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND THE LEADING EDGE OF THE PREFRONTAL SHORTWAVE SHOULD BE BEGINNING TO PRODUCE A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS OVER NORTHERN NEW YORK. THERE WILL BE SOME INSTABILITY IN THE AFTERNOON BUT IT SHOULD BE MAINLY ISOLATED TO THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY SO IF ANY SHOWERS DO DEVELOP INTO THUNDERSTORMS EXPECT THAT MAINLY TO BE ONLY WEST OF THE ADIRONDACKS TOMORROW. THAT IS MAINLY BECAUSE THE BACK DOOR FRONT WILL PUSH ALL THE WAY INTO THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY AND THE MARITIME AIR MASS SHOULDN`T SUPPORT DEW POINTS HIGH ENOUGH FOR SIGNIFICANT CONVECTIVE INSTABILITY. EXPECT MAX TEMPS TOMORROW TO BE COMPLETELY MESOSCALE DRIVEN AS THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY WILL WARM UNDER MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES INITIALLY INTO THE LOW 80S WHEREAS THE AREAS BEHIND THE BACKDOOR FRONT ALONG THE VERMONT/NEW HAMPSHIRE BORDER WILL STRUGGLE TO REACH 70S WITH UPPER 60S MORE LIKELY. ADDITIONALLY WITH THE LAKE TEMPS STILL JUST AROUND 50 I EXPECT TEMPS IN AND AROUND THE BROAD LAKE IN THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY TO BE A GOOD 3-5 DEGREES F COOLER TOMORROW THAN THE REST OF THE VALLEY. THERE WILL BE A STRONG NEARLY 15 DEGREE EAST/WEST TEMPERATURE GRADIENT IN THE MAX TEMPS TOMORROW.  AS THE SURFACE LOW AND CORRESPONDING FRONTAL SYSTEM PUSH EAST TOMORROW EVENING WE WILL SEE SHOWERS MOVE INTO THE REST OF THE REGION EARLY MONDAY EVENING AND PERSIST OVERNIGHT AS THE PREFRONTAL SHORT WAVE PASSES THROUGH THE AREA. THEN MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE RAIN CHANCES WILL DROP OFF FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING BEFORE THE FRONT ACTUALLY ARRIVES. AS THE FRONT DOES MOVE INTO THE AREA TUESDAY MORNING THE HIRES MODELS DEPICT CONVECTIVE SHOWERS RAMPING UP QUITE QUICKLY MAINLY EAST OF THE ADIRONDACKS WHERE A NARROW RIBBON OF >1000 J/KG OF CAPE WILL PROVIDE ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO PRODUCE SOME DECENTLY STRONG THUNDERSTORMS OVER NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VERMONT. THE 0-6KM BULK SHEAR WILL BE CLOSE TO 30KTS SO WHERE THE INTERSECTION OF GOOD SHEAR AND THE NARROW RIBBON OF CAPE ARE THERE SHOULD BE SOME DECENT CONVECTIVE SHOWERS THAT DEVELOP.  BEHIND THAT FRONT TEMPS WILL CRASH INTO THE UPPER 30S TO UPPER 40S FOR OVERNIGHT LOWS WITH THE COLDEST TEMPS BEING IN THE NORTHERN ADIRONDACKS APPROACHING FROST CONDITIONS FOR THE NORTHERN ADIRONDACKS.  
AS OF 346 PM EDT SUNDAY...SEASONABLY COOL AND RELATIVELY QUIET WEATHER IS EXPECTED FROM WEDNESDAY ONWARD INTO THE LATE WEEK TIME FRAME WITH THIS MORNING`S GLOBAL OUTPUT KEEPING IN GENERAL CONSENSUS WITH PRIOR FORECAST RUNS. THE PRIMARY IDEA WILL BE FOR SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE TO SETTLE ACROSS THE NORTHEAST, BRIDGED BY COOL NORTHERN STREAM TROUGHING ALOFT. THIS WILL PROVIDE SEASONABLY COOL TEMPERATURES IN THE WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY TIME FRAME AS DAILY HIGHS RANGE FROM THE UPPER 50S TO MID 60S AND OVERNIGHT LOWS DROP INTO THE 30S AND 40S UNDER LIGHT NORTHERLY FLOW. SOME PATCHY FROST WILL BE POSSIBLE IN MANY SPOTS OUTSIDE THE BROADER VALLEYS DURING THIS PERIOD, BUT WILL BE HEAVILY GOVERNED BY BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW AND COVERAGE OF ANY CLOUDS. THEN TRENDING WARMER BY NEXT SUNDAY AS TEMPERATURES RETURN TO THE 70S UNDER LIGHT SOUTH RETURN FLOW. IN TERMS OF PRECIPITATION THERE COULD BE A STRAY LIGHT SHOWER OR SPRINKLE ACROSS THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS ON WEDNESDAY, AND AGAIN BY FRIDAY WITH WEAK REINFORCING SFC TROUGH PASSAGES, BUT BY AND LARGE DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED.  
A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE TERMINALS FROM EAST TO WEST OVERNIGHT.  VFR INITIALLY...THEN MVFR/IFR CEILINGS ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE IN FROM THE EAST...MAINLY AFTER 6-8Z. A BIT EARLIER OVER KGON. VSBYS LOWER IN FOG AND DRIZZLE AS WELL LATE TONIGHT. IN FACT...LIFR CANNOT BE RULED OUT IN A FEW SPOTS.  SUB VFR CONDITIONS LINGER THROUGH THE MONDAY MORNING PUSH...AND EXPECT CEILINGS TO IMPROVE TO HIGH END MVFR DURING THE AFTERNOON.  LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS WILL GIVE WAY TO A DEVELOPING E/NE WIND LATE TONIGHT AFTER THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH. EASTERLY WINDS CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY MONDAY...9-14 KTS.  
AS OF 346 PM EDT SUNDAY...LATE MONDAY THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO GIVE WAY TO AN APPROACHING COLD FROM THE WEST. BY NOON THE CENTER OF THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BE CROSSING OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND THE LEADING EDGE OF THE PREFRONTAL SHORTWAVE SHOULD BE BEGINNING TO PRODUCE A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS OVER NORTHERN NEW YORK. THERE WILL BE SOME INSTABILITY IN THE AFTERNOON BUT IT SHOULD BE MAINLY ISOLATED TO THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY SO IF ANY SHOWERS DO DEVELOP INTO THUNDERSTORMS EXPECT THAT MAINLY TO BE ONLY WEST OF THE ADIRONDACKS TOMORROW. THAT IS MAINLY BECAUSE THE BACK DOOR FRONT WILL PUSH ALL THE WAY INTO THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY AND THE MARITIME AIRMASS SHOULDN`T SUPPORT DEW POINTS HIGH ENOUGH FOR SIGNIFICANT CONVECTIVE INSTABILITY. EXPECT MAX TEMPS TOMORROW TO BE COMPLETELY MESOSCALE DRIVEN AS THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY WILL WARM UNDER MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES INITIALLY INTO THE LOW 80S WHEREAS THE AREAS BEHIND THE BACKDOOR FRONT ALONG THE VERMONT/NEW HAMPSHIRE BORDER WILL STRUGGLE TO REACH 70S WITH UPPER 60S MORE LIKELY. ADDITIONALLY WITH THE LAKE TEMPS STILL JUST AROUND 50 I EXPECT TEMPS IN AND AROUND THE BROAD LAKE IN THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY TO BE A GOOD 3-5 DEGREES F COOLER TOMORROW THAN THE REST OF THE VALLEY. THERE WILL BE A STRONG NEARLY 15 DEGREE EAST/WEST TEMPERATURE GRADIENT IN THE MAX TEMPS TOMORROW.  AS THE SURFACE LOW AND CORRESPONDING FRONTAL SYSTEM PUSH EAST TOMORROW EVENING WE WILL SEE SHOWERS MOVE INTO THE REST OF THE REGION EARLY MONDAY EVENING AND PERSIST OVERNIGHT AS THE PREFRONTAL SHORT WAVE PASSES THROUGH THE AREA. THEN MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE RAIN CHANCES WILL DROP OFF FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING BEFORE THE FRONT ACTUALLY ARRIVES. AS THE FRONT DOES MOVE INTO THE AREA TUESDAY MORNING THE HIRES MODELS DEPICT CONVECTIVE SHOWERS RAMPING UP QUITE QUICKLY MAINLY EAST OF THE ADIRONDACKS WHERE A NARROW RIBBON OF >1000 J/KG OF CAPE WILL PROVIDE ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO PRODUCE SOME DECENTLY STRONG THUNDERSTORMS OVER NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VERMONT. THE 0-6KM BULK SHEAR WILL BE CLOSE TO 30KTS SO WHERE THE INTERSECTION OF GOOD SHEAR AND THE NARROW RIBBON OF CAPE ARE THERE SHOULD BE SOME DECENT CONVECTIVE SHOWERS THAT DEVELOP.  BEHIND THAT FRONT TEMPS WILL CRASH INTO THE UPPER 30S TO UPPER 40S FOR OVERNIGHT LOWS WITH THE COLDEST TEMPS BEING IN THE NORTHERN ADIRONDACKS APPROACHING FROST CONDITIONS FOR THE NORTHERN ADIRONDACKS.  
THROUGH 00Z TUESDAY...MAINLY VFR EXPECTED THROUGH THE PERIOD. ONLY EXCEPTIONS WILL BE A PERIOD OF IFR BR/FG POSSIBLE AT KSLK TERMINAL 06Z-12Z AND A PERIOD OF MVFR POSSIBLE AT KMPV IN CLOUDS AND BR. SOME INCREASING CLOUDS MONDAY AFTERNOON WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS/STORMS AFTER 20Z AT KMSS/KSLK.  WINDS GENERALLY LIGHT AND VARIABLE TONIGHT...BUT GUSTY SOUTHEASTERLY GAP FLOW WILL DEVELOP AT KRUT AFTER 06Z AS BACKDOOR MARINE FRONT ADVANCES WEST. THIS FRONT WILL BRING THE STRATUS INTO KMPV EARLY MONDAY AS WELL. SOUTHERLY FLOW INCREASES ACROSS THE REGION DURING MONDAY...AND WILL BE MOST PRONOUNCED IN THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY...WITH GUSTS NEAR 25 KTS KBTV/KPBG BY AFTERNOON.  OUTLOOK 00Z TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...  00Z TUESDAY THROUGH 00Z WEDNESDAY...BKN/OVC VFR/MVFR WITH SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS. BRIEF IFR POSSIBLE IN HEAVIER DOWNPOURS. THUNDER POSSIBLE.  00Z WEDNESDAY ONWARD...MAINLY VFR WITH HIGH PRESSURE.  
A WARM AND HUMID AIR MASS WILL REMAIN OVER THE REGION THROUGH MONDAY. A PERIOD OF THUNDERSTORMS WITH LOCALIZED HEAVY RAIN AND GUSTY WINDS WILL PUSH ACROSS THE AREA MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT. A COOLER AND DRY AIRMASS WILL ARRIVE BEHIND THE FRONT FOR THE MID WEEK PERIOD.  
LAST VESTIGES OF DIURNAL CONVECTION HAVE WEAKENED TO THE POINT OF DISSIPATION. MUGGY AIRMASS WILL REMAIN IN PLACE WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 60S ACROSS WESTERN NEW YORK TO THE MID 50S FOR THE NORTH COUNTRY. THIS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE COMBINED WITH LIGHT WINDS WILL ONCE AGAIN BRING THE POTENTIAL FOR AREAS OF FOG OVERNIGHT...PERHAPS EVEN SOME DENSE FOG ALONG THE SOUTHERN TIER FOR AREAS WHICH RECEIVE ANY RAINFALL.  A DEEP LAYER SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL REMAIN FIRMLY IN PLACE ACROSS THE LOWER LAKES MONDAY. THE REGION WILL BE LARGELY OUTSIDE THE MAIN HEIGHT FALL CENTER AND ASSOCIATED UPPER JET CORE ATTENDANT TO THE CLOSED LOW MEANDERING ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS. ANY EARLY DAY STRATUS DEBRIS WILL GET MIXED OUT INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD FOR SEEING A GOOD BIT OF SUN BY THE MIDDAY PERIOD. THIS SHOULD YIELD A SOLID DIURNAL TEMPERATURE RESPONSE WITH HIGHS MAKING A DECENT RUN AT THE LOWER TO MID 80S...ESPECIALLY ACROSS INTERIOR SECTIONS OF THE GENESEE VALLEY AND FINGER LAKES.  COLD FRONTAL TIMING LOOKS TO BE CENTERED BEYOND THIS PERIOD. THEREFORE WE WILL NEED SOME OTHER FORCING MECHANISM TO CAPITALIZE UPON WHAT SHOULD BE A MODERATELY UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT WITH MLCAPES NEARING 2000 J/KG DURING PEAK HEATING. IT IS LIKELY THAT A PRE- FRONTAL TROUGH AXIS AND LAKE BREEZE CONVERGENCE WILL BE THE PRIMARY FOCUS REGIONS FOR CONVECTION.  IT APPEARS THAT THE STRONGER MID LEVEL WIND FIELDS WILL RESIDE BEHIND THE FRONT...KEEPING SHEAR PROFILES RATHER WEAK. THIS WILL BRING THE POTENTIAL FOR SLOW MOVING CELLS AND LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINFALL...ESPECIALLY IF ANY TRAINING CELLS EMERGE.  
EXPECT VFR CONDITIONS TO PREVAIL THROUGH THE LATE EVENING...THEN AREAS OF FOG WITH LOCAL IFR CONDITIONS TO DEVELOP AFTER 02Z ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER AND AFTER 04Z FOR THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA.  FOG WILL DISSIPATE IN THE MORNING ON MONDAY VFR CONDITIONS IN SCATTERED RAIN SHOWERS AHEAD OF AN ADVANCING COLD FRONT.  OUTLOOK... MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...VFR/MVFR WITH SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LIKELY. TUESDAY...VFR/MVFR WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS. WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...VFR.  
LIGHT WINDS AND MINIMAL WAVES WILL CONTINUE ON THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES THROUGH TONIGHT WITH AREAS OF FOG REDEVELOPING AS A WARM AND HUMID AIRMASS REMAINS OVER THE COOL LAKE WATERS.  CONDITIONS ON THE LAKES SHOULD REMAIN QUIET OUTSIDE OF ANY FOG AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS PRODUCING ASSOCIATED HIGHER WINDS AND WAVES INTO MONDAY.  A COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP ACROSS THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES LATE MONDAY NIGHT/TUESDAY WITH AN INCREASE IN WIND SPEED AND WAVE ACTION INTO TUESDAY. SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES MAY BE NEEDED.  
MAINLY VFR EXPECTED THROUGH THE TAF PERIOD.  TWO CAVEATS NEED TO BE WATCHED. THE CROSSOVER TEMPERATURE LOOKS TO BE AROUND 55 AT MOST OF OUR SITES. WE ARE FORECASTING A LOW A LITTLE LOWER THAN THAT AT KGFL. THE WIND LOOKS TO DECOUPLE. WE DECIDED TO INCLUDE MVFR FOG IN THAT TAF AFTER 09Z...AND WILL MONITOR TO SEE IF WE NEED TO DROP IT TO IFR.  OTHERWISE NO FOG THREAT...BUT SOME STRATUS MIGHT WORK UP THE HUDSON VALLEY... MAINLY SOUTH OF KALB. HAVE INCLUDE VFR STRATUS AT KPOU AFTER 09Z AND MVFR STARTS AT KPSF AFTER 10Z.  ANY FOG WILL DISSIPATE BY 12Z...AND ANY MVFR STRATUS IS EXPECTED TO LIFT BACK OVER 3000 FEET (VFR) AFTER ABOUT 14Z.  THAT SHOULD LEAVE US WITH A MAINLY DRY ON MONDAY. HOWEVER SHOWER CHANCES INCREASE ENOUGH AT KGFL BY 22Z TO MENTION VCSH. A RUMBLE OF THUNDER IS REMOTELY POSSIBLE AS WELL.  THE NORTHWEST WIND (AT ALL BUT KPOU) WILL BECOME LIGHT AND VARIABLE LATER THIS EVENING. AT KPOU THE WIND WILL LIGHT AND VARIABLE ALL NIGHT.  BY MONDAY MORNING...A SOUTH WIND WILL INCREASE TO 5KTS...THEN TO 10KTS BY MIDDAY WITH GUSTS TO 20KTS AT KALB.  SHOWERS AND EVEN THUNDERSTORMS LOOK TO POTENTIALLY IMPACT ALL THE TERMINALS BY MONDAY NIGHT.  OUTLOOK... MONDAY NIGHT: HIGH OPERATIONAL IMPACT. LIKELY SHRA...TSRA. TUESDAY: HIGH OPERATIONAL IMPACT. LIKELY SHRA...TSRA. TUESDAY NIGHT: LOW OPERATIONAL IMPACT. SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHRA. WEDNESDAY: LOW OPERATIONAL IMPACT. BREEZY NO SIG WX. WEDNESDAY NIGHT TO THURSDAY: NO OPERATIONAL IMPACT. NO SIG WX  
FORECAST IS ON TRACK...WITH MINOR CHANGES MADE TO REFLECT CURRENT OBSERVATIONS. BACKDOOR COLD FRONT IS CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH NORTHEASTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA WITH KGON SHIFTING TO AN EAST SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION...THE TEMPERATURE DROPPING INTO THE UPPER 50S.  OTHERWISE EXPECT CLOUDS TO INCREASE FROM E TO W BEHIND THE BACKDOOR COLD FRONT...WITH PATCHY FOG/DRIZZLE DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT FROM W TO E AS WELL.  FOR LOWS USED A BLEND OF MAV/MET/ECS GUIDANCE WITH NAM 2-METER TEMPERATURES. LOWS SHOULD BE AROUND 10 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.  
GENERALLY LIGHT RAINFALL AMOUNTS ARE POSSIBLE IN ANY SHOWERS EARLY THIS EVENING.  FROM ONE TO THREE TENTHS OF AN INCH OF RAIN IS POSSIBLE FROM LATE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING. LITTLE OR NO HYDROLOGIC IMPACT IS EXPECTED.  NO PRECIPITATION IS THEN EXPECTED THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK.  
AS OF 951 PM EDT SUNDAY...GOING FORECAST REMAINS IN GOOD SHAPE. PROGRESSION OF BACKDOOR FRONT HAS SLOWED AND HAS BECOME LESS DEFINED OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF HOURS...BUT STILL POSITIONED ACROSS NEW HAMPSHIRE AT 10 PM (BETWEEN KEENE AND CONCORD). THIS WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE WESTWARD AND APPROACH THE VERMONT BORDER BY AROUND MIDNIGHT AND MOVE UP TO ABOUT THE SPINE OF THE GREENS TOWARDS 06Z OR S0. WIND SHIFT MAY PROPAGATE INTO THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY BUT COOLER TEMPERATURES SHOULD REMAIN GREENS/EAST. MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES WILL BE THE RULE FOR MOST...EXCEPT SOME LOWER CLOUDS SPREADING INTO PARTS OF EASTERN VERMONT OVERNIGHT W/ BACKDOOR FRONT. LOOKING AT LOWS GENERALLY 45-55F.  
FEW REMAINING CELLS FROM LATER AFTERNOON CONVECTION ACROSS SOUTHERN WESTERN NEW YORK ARE WEAKENING TO THE POINT OF DISSIPATION. MUGGY AIRMASS WILL REMAIN IN PLACE WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 60S ACROSS WESTERN NEW YORK TO THE MID 50S FOR THE NORTH COUNTRY. THIS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE COMBINED WITH LIGHT WINDS WILL ONCE AGAIN BRING THE POTENTIAL FOR AREAS OF FOG OVERNIGHT...PERHAPS EVEN SOME DENSE FOG ALONG THE SOUTHERN TIER FOR AREAS WHICH RECEIVE ANY RAINFALL.  A DEEP LAYER SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL REMAIN FIRMLY IN PLACE ACROSS THE LOWER LAKES MONDAY. THE REGION WILL BE LARGELY OUTSIDE THE MAIN HEIGHT FALL CENTER AND ASSOCIATED UPPER JET CORE ATTENDANT TO THE CLOSED LOW MEANDERING ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS. ANY EARLY DAY STRATUS DEBRIS WILL GET MIXED OUT INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD FOR SEEING A GOOD BIT OF SUN BY THE MIDDAY PERIOD. THIS SHOULD YIELD A SOLID DIURNAL TEMPERATURE RESPONSE WITH HIGHS MAKING A DECENT RUN AT THE LOWER TO MID 80S...ESPECIALLY ACROSS INTERIOR SECTIONS OF THE GENESEE VALLEY AND FINGER LAKES.  COLD FRONTAL TIMING LOOKS TO BE CENTERED BEYOND THIS PERIOD. THEREFORE WE WILL NEED SOME OTHER FORCING MECHANISM TO CAPITALIZE UPON WHAT SHOULD BE A MODERATELY UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT WITH MLCAPES NEARING 2000 J/KG DURING PEAK HEATING. IT IS LIKELY THAT A PRE- FRONTAL TROUGH AXIS AND LAKE BREEZE CONVERGENCE WILL BE THE PRIMARY FOCUS REGIONS FOR CONVECTION.  IT APPEARS THAT THE STRONGER MID LEVEL WIND FIELDS WILL RESIDE BEHIND THE FRONT...KEEPING SHEAR PROFILES RATHER WEAK. THIS WILL BRING THE POTENTIAL FOR SLOW MOVING CELLS AND LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINFALL...ESPECIALLY IF ANY TRAINING CELLS EMERGE.  
VFR IS EXPECTED TO PREVAIL FOR MOST OF THIS FORECAST PERIOD. AREAS OF MVFR VSBY OR CIGS MAY DEVELOP ALONG THE KELM-KAVP CORRIDOR LATE TONIGHT AS A WARM FRONT APPROACHES FROM SOUTHERN PENNSYLVANIA... BUT CONFIDENCE IS NOT STRONG FOR ANYTHING LOWER THAN THAT. WILL HAVE TO MONITOR CLOSELY AS SFC MOISTURE WILL BE INCREASING.  COMPLEX MOVEMENT OF FRONTAL BOUNDARIES FROM ALL DIRECTIONS WILL OCCUR ON MONDAY WITH TSRA EXPECTED TO DEVELOP FROM WEST TO EAST DURING THE MID-LATE AFTERNOON HOURS. PLAN ON FLIGHT PLAN INTERRUPTIONS FROM THIS ACTIVITY BETWEEN 18Z-00Z. A COASTAL FRONT WILL ALSO BE SLIPPING INTO THE REGION...PROBABLY AFFECTING KAVP WITH A MVFR MARINE LAYER OF CLOUDS BY 00Z.  LIGHT WINDS OVERNIGHT BECOME SE MON MORNING...VEERING SW DURING THE AFTERNOON. SPEEDS GENLY 10 KTS OR LESS.  
AS OF 745 PM EDT...A BEAUTIFUL MID MAY EVENING FEELING MORE LIKE MID JUNE. TEMPERATURES STILL IN THE LOWER 80S IN MANY VALLEY LOCATIONS... 70S HIGHER TERRAIN. THE SKY WAS MOSTLY CLEAR.  IT SHOULD REMAIN CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS AS TEMPERATURES SETTLED DOWN THROUGH THE 70S AND EVENTUALLY 60S.  OVERNIGHT...AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES OFF SHORE...AND A BOUNDARY LURKING TO OUR SOUTH...THERE ARE SIGNALS THAT STRATUS COULD FORM SOUTH OF LONG ISLAND AND THEN COULD MOVE NORTH UP THE HUDSON VALLEY AND AREAS EAST OF THE HUDSON VALLEY...POSSIBLY TO JUST SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL REGION BY DAYBREAK. IF THIS HAPPENED...WE MIGHT HAVE TO ADJUST LOWS A LITTLE UPWARD BUT FOR NOW...THEY LOOK REASONABLE AND WERE LEFT ALONE. LOOK FOR LOWS GENERALLY IN THE 50S...CLOSER TO 60 IN THE CAPITAL REGION.  THERE MIGHT BE SOME PATCHY FOG AREAS WELL NORTH OF THE CAPITAL REGION. NOT IN THE GRIDS YET...BUT MIGHT INCLUDE WITH THE LATER EVENING UPDATE IF CONFIDENCE INCREASES.  SO...FOR THIS UPDATE...JUST TINKERED WITH THE CLOUDS OVERNIGHT...ADDING A BIT MORE SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL REGION AND ADJUSTED THE HOURLY GRIDS.   
AS OF 720 PM EDT SUNDAY...GOING FORECAST IS IN GOOD SHAPE. BACKDOOR FRONT CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH NEW HAMPSHIRE (NOTED LINE OF CU AND WIND SHIFTS TO THE EAST/SOUTHEAST AT CONCORD AND LACONIA WITHIN THE PAST 1-2 HOURS). THIS WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE WESTWARD AND APPROACH THE VERMONT BORDER BY AROUND 03Z AND MOVE UP TO ABOUT THE SPINE OF THE GREENS TOWARDS 06Z OR S0. WIND SHIFT MAY PROPAGATE INTO THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY BUT COOLER TEMPERATURES SHOULD REMAIN GREENS/EAST. MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES WILL BE THE RULE FOR MOST...EXCEPT SOME LOWER CLOUDS SPREADING INTO PARTS OF EASTERN VERMONT OVERNIGHT W/ BACKDOOR FRONT. LOOKING AT LOWS GENERALLY 45-55F.  PREVIOUS DISCUSSION FROM 346 PM SUNDAY... PLEASANT WEATHER WILL CONTINUE THIS EVENING AS DRY LOW AND MID LEVEL LAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE LEAVE THE NORTH COUNTRY WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES OVERNIGHT. EARLY IN THE EVENING A BACK DOOR COLD FRONT WILL BEGIN TO PUSH FROM EAST TO WEST ACROSS NEW ENGLAND WITH A PRONOUNCED WIND SHIFT TO EASTERLY FLOW AND MODERATE COOLING. UPSTREAM TEMPS BEHIND THE BACK DOOR FRONT ARE ALREADY IN THE UPPER 50S SO I EXPECT OVERNIGHT AS THE FRONT COMES THROUGH TO SEE TEMPS DROP PRETTY QUICKLY ALONG WITH THE RADIATIONAL COOLING FROM CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS. WITH THE EXTRA DRYING FROM TODAY I DONT EXPECT FOG TO BE AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE WITH MOST OF THE AREA SEEING CLEAR SKIES WHICH SHOULD HAVE HELPED TO DRY OUT MOST OF THE TOPSOIL TODAY. THE LONE EXCEPTION MAY BE A SARANAC LAKE WHERE THE CROSSOVER TEMP OF 45F WILL BE CLOSE TO BEING MET OVERNIGHT. NAM GUIDANCE CURRENTLY SUGGESTS SOME LIGHT PATCHY FOG WILL SET IN THERE BUT NO WHERE ELSE SO I`VE LEFT THAT OUT OF THE FORECAST FOR NOW.  
FORECAST IS ON TRACK. JUST MINOR UPDATES NEEDED TO SKY...TEMPS AND DEWS NEXT SEVERAL HOURS BASED ON OBS AND TRENDS. STILL HAVE 250-500 J/KG OF CAPE OVER THE LOWER HUDSON VALLEY/NE NJ/MOST OF NYC. THIS ENERGY COUPLED BY FORCING ASSOCIATED WITH A SHORTWAVE MOVING THROUGH THE REGION CONTINUES TO WARRANT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR A FEW MORE HOURS OVER THIS AREA. IN FACT...A SHOWER DID POP UP OVER UNION COUNTY OVER THE LAST HOUR.  OTHERWISE EXPECT CLOUDS TO INCREASE FROM E TO W BEHIND THE BACKDOOR COLD FRONT...WITH PATCHY FOG/DRIZZLE DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT FROM W TO E AS WELL.  FOR LOWS USED A BLEND OF MAV/MET/ECS GUIDANCE WITH NAM 2-METER TEMPERATURES. LOWS SHOULD BE AROUND 10 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.  
A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE TERMINALS FROM EAST TO WEST TONIGHT.  VFR INITIALLY...THEN MVFR/IFR CEILINGS ARE EXPECTED...MAINLY AFTER 5- 7Z. A BIT EARLIER OVER KGON. VSBYS LOWER IN FOG AND DRIZZLE AS WELL LATE TONIGHT. IN FACT...LIFR CANNOT BE RULED OUT IN A FEW SPOTS.  SUB VFR CONDITIONS LINGER THROUGH THE MONDAY MORNING PUSH...AND EXPECT CEILINGS TO IMPROVE TO HIGH END MVFR BY AFTERNOON.  LIGHTENING SEA BREEZES THIS EVENING WILL GIVE WAY TO A DEVELOPING E/NE WINDS LATE TONIGHT AFTER THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH. EASTERLY WINDS CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY MONDAY...9-14 KTS.  
THROUGH 18Z MONDAY...VFR EXPECTED THROUGH THE PERIOD AS LIGHT NORTHERLY FLOW TRENDS SOUTHERLY AFTER 12Z MONDAY. ONLY EXCEPTIONS WILL BE A PERIOD OF IFR BR/FG POSSIBLE AT KSLK TERMINAL 06-12Z MONDAY, AND GUSTY SOUTHEASTERLY GAP FLOW DEVELOPING AT KRUT AFTER 06Z AS BACKDOOR MARINE FRONT ADVANCES WEST.  OUTLOOK 18Z MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...  18Z MONDAY THROUGH 00Z TUESDAY...MAINLY VFR. SCT SHOWERS/STORMS POSSIBLE KSLK/KMSS WITH BRIEF MVFR/IFR POSSIBLE IN HEAVIER DOWNPOURS.  00Z TUESDAY THROUGH 00Z WEDNESDAY...BKN/OVC VFR/MVFR WITH SCT SHOWERS. THUNDER POSSIBLE.  00Z WEDNESDAY ONWARD...VFR WITH HIGH PRESSURE.  
FNTL BNDRY WHICH CAUSED YSRTDY/S SHWRS AND TSTMS HAS STALLED WELL SOUTH OF THE AREA...BUT IS STILL RESULTING IN A VFR CLD DECK AT AVP. THIS FNT WILL GATHER ITSELF AND TAKE ANOTHER RUN AT THE AREA AFTER THE END OF THE TAF PD. IN THE MEANTIME...VFR CONDS WILL CONT THRU THE DAY TODAY AND INTO THIS EVENING. LTR TNGT...LL MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO INCRS AND RESULT IN SOME MVFR CIGS AND VSBYS...MAINLY SOUTH OF RME AND SYR. THERE WILL BE SOME IMPRVMT MON MRNG BEFORE THE END OF THE PD. XPCT LGT WINDS THRU THE PD.  
AS OF 400 PM EDT...SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS THE SURFACE BOUNDARY /COLD FRONT/ WAS NOW SOUTH OF THE CWFA WITH A WEAK SHORT WAVE PER THE H2O VAPOR LOOP NOW TRACK ALONG OR JUST SOUTH OF THE NY STATE LINE. THEREFORE WE HAVE REMOVED THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR OUR SOUTHERN ZONES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON HOURS. SURFACE HIGH TO THE NORTH OF MAINE IS EXPECTED TO BUILD SOUTHWARD ALONG THE COASTLINE RESULTING IN A SOMEWHAT MARINE LAYER ADVECTING INLAND. LOW LEVEL FLOW OVERNIGHT BECOMES EAST-SOUTHEAST WHICH COULD BRING ABOUT ADDITIONAL STRATUS INTO THE MID HUDSON VALLEY...SOUTHERN CATSKILLS AND NW CT. OTHERWISE...A QUIET EVENING INTO THE EARLY OVERNIGHT PERIOD WITH A MAINLY CLEAR SKY FOR MOST OF THE REGION. OVERNIGHT LOWS ARE FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE CURRENT FORECASTS AND MOS VALUES WITH MAINLY 50S.  
MONDAY...THE AFOREMENTIONED SURFACE HIGH ALONG THE MAINE COASTLINE WILL EXTEND ITS INFLUENCE FURTHER WEST ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION. A SCT-BKN MARINE LAYER STRATUS DECK IS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 1/3RD OF THE REGION AND LOW LEVEL SOUTHEAST FLOW BECOMES A BIT MORE ENHANCED. THIS TOO WILL BE A FACTOR OF THE UPSTREAM CYCLONE APPROACHING THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES REGION FURTHER ENHANCING THE AGEOSTROPHIC FLOW. MEANWHILE THE UPPER RIDGE AXIS WILL MIGRATE FURTHER EAST THROUGH THE DAY AND AS THE CYCLONE FURTHER TRACKS INTO THE CENTRAL GREAT LAKES REGION. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR MOISTURE TO QUICKLY ADVECT NORTHWARD WITH ELEVATED SHOWERS AND EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ALONG AND WEST OF I81 CORRIDOR THEN MIGRATING EASTWARD INTO OUR WESTERN ZONES DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. DUE TO THE ELEVATED NATURE OF THESE CELLS...NOT EXPECTING SEVERE WEATHER AT THIS TIME. DUE TO THE INCREASE IN CLOUD COVERAGE...TEMPERATURES MONDAY WILL BE A BIT COOLER THAN SUNDAYS WITH MAINLY 60S FOR THE TERRAIN AND 70S FOR VALLEY LOCATIONS.  MONDAY NIGHT...NCEP MODEL SUITE IS IN RATHER GOOD AGREEMENT WITH UPSTREAM APPROACH OF THE PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AXIS AND DEEPENING MOISTURE PROFILES. PWATS IN EXCESS OF 1.50 INCHES ARE PROGGED SO THE POTENTIAL FOR MODERATE TO HEAVY RAINFALL WILL EXIST. AS DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS NARROW...SO WILL VISIBILITIES AS WE WILL PLACE PATCHY FOG IN THE GRIDS FOR THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD AS LOWS WILL BE MILD...MAINLY BETWEEN 55F-65F.  TUESDAY...THIS WILL BE THE MAIN CHALLENGE OF THIS FORECAST AS IT WILL BE A RACE BETWEEN THE PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED PRECIP AND THE APPROACH OF THE MAIN COLD FRONT DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. IF WE ARE ABLE TO ATTAIN SEVERAL BREAKS IN THE OVERCAST...WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR A MORE SIGNIFICANT THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT /AS SUGGESTED BY THE SWODY3 FROM SPC/. MODELS ARE IN RATHER GOOD AGREEMENT WITH EXITING THE TROUGH AND PRECIP WITH SURFACE LAYER RECOVERING TO OUR WEST. SBCAPES FROM THE NCEP MODELS SUGGEST VALUES CLIMB TO BETWEEN 1-2K J/KG WITH 0-6KM SHEAR OF 30-40KTS. FORECAST BUFR PROFILES DO SUGGEST RATHER LOW LCL/S YET THE HODOGRAPHS ARE MORE STRAIGHT AND LINEAR. WE WILL PLACE CHC-SCT POPS FOR CONVECTION AT THIS TIME WITH NEAR TO ABOVE SEASONABLE TEMPERATURES.  TUESDAY NIGHT...STRENGTHENING COLD ADVECTION IN THE WAKE OF THE COLD FROPA WITH A BRISK WEST-NORTHWEST WINDS. MODELS ARE SUGGESTING AMPLE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AROUND H850 TO STREAM DOWN FROM LAKE ONTARIO AND WITH UPSLOPE CONDITIONS FOR SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS POSSIBLE. H850 TEMPS TOWARD SUNRISE ARE EXPECTED TO RANGE FROM ZERO TO -2C FROM ALBANY AND POINTS WEST AND NORTHWEST WITH LOWER POSITIVE SINGLE DIGITS SOUTH AND EAST OF ALBANY.  
A WEAK COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY HAS MOVED SOUTH OF THE FA OVER SOUTHEAST NY. IN ITS WAKE A LARGE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WAS BUILDING SOUTHEAST FROM SOUTHERN ONTARIO. AS A RESULT SKIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS AFTERNOON INTO THE OVERNIGHT WILL BE MAINLY SKC-SCT045 SCT250 WITH MORE IN THE WAY OF CLOUDS AT KPOU WHICH WILL BE CLOSER TO THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WITH BKN040 BKN060 EXPECTED.  MAINLY MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES ARE EXPECTED TONIGHT HOWEVER SOME STRATUS MAY MOVE IN TOWARD SUNRISE WITH THE LIGHT ONSHORE FLOW OFF THE ATLANTIC ESPECIALLY AT KPSF AND KPOU...OTHERWISE KALB AND KGFL WILL BE MAINLY SCT250 MONDAY MORNING.  WINDS WILL BE GENERALLY VARIABLE AT 10 KTS OR LESS THIS AFTERNOON...BECOMING LIGHT AND VARIABLE TONIGHT AND THEN S-SE AT 5-10 KTS ON MONDAY MORNING.  OUTLOOK... MONDAY NIGHT: HIGH OPERATIONAL IMPACT. LIKELY SHRA...TSRA. TUESDAY: HIGH OPERATIONAL IMPACT. LIKELY SHRA...TSRA. TUESDAY NIGHT: LOW OPERATIONAL IMPACT. SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHRA. WEDNESDAY: LOW OPERATIONAL IMPACT. BREEZY NO SIG WX. WEDNESDAY NIGHT TO THURSDAY: NO OPERATIONAL IMPACT. NO SIG WX  
MOISTURE WILL INCREASE THROUGH TUESDAY WITH MODERATE TO PERHAPS HEAVY RAINFALL MONDAY NIGHT. AS GREEN UP IS UNDERWAY...THIS TOO WILL FURTHER LIMIT FIRE WEATHER RELATED CONCERNS.  THE RH VALUES WILL RECOVER TO 85 TO 100 PERCENT TONIGHT WITH SOME DEW FORMATION. EXPECT THE RH VALUES TO LOWER TO 45 TO 60 PERCENT MONDAY AFTERNOON THEN WET WEATHER MONDAY NIGHT.  THE WINDS WILL BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE TONIGHT. THE WINDS WILL BE FROM THE SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH AT 5 TO 15 MPH ON MONDAY.  
AS OF 346 PM EDT SUNDAY... PLEASANT WEATHER WILL CONTINUE THIS EVENING AS DRY LOW AND MID LEVEL LAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE LEAVE THE NORTH COUNTRY WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES OVERNIGHT. EARLY IN THE EVENING A BACK DOOR COLD FRONT WILL BEGIN TO PUSH FROM EAST TO WEST ACROSS NEW ENGLAND WITH A PRONOUNCED WIND SHIFT TO EASTERLY FLOW AND MODERATE COOLING. UPSTREAM TEMPS BEHIND THE BACK DOOR FRONT ARE ALREADY IN THE UPPER 50S SO I EXPECT OVERNIGHT AS THE FRONT COMES THROUGH TO SEE TEMPS DROP PRETTY QUICKLY ALONG WITH THE RADIATIONAL COOLING FROM CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS. WITH THE EXTRA DRYING FROM TODAY I DONT EXPECT FOG TO BE AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE WITH MOST OF THE AREA SEEING CLEAR SKIES WHICH SHOULD HAVE HELPED TO DRY OUT MOST OF THE TOPSOIL TODAY. THE LONE EXCEPTION MAY BE A SARANAC LAKE WHERE THE CROSSOVER TEMP OF 45F WILL BE CLOSE TO BEING MET OVERNIGHT. NAM GUIDANCE CURRENTLY SUGGESTS SOME LIGHT PATCHY FOG WILL SET IN THERE BUT NO WHERE ELSE SO I`VE LEFT THAT OUT OF THE FORECAST FOR NOW.  
AS OF 346 PM EDT SUNDAY...LATE MONDAY THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO GIVE WAY TO AN APPROACHING COLD FROM THE WEST. BY NOON THE CENTER OF THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BE CROSSING OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND THE LEADING EDGE OF THE PREFRONTAL SHORTWAVE SHOULD BE BEGINNING TO PRODUCE A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS OVER NORTHERN NEW YORK. THERE WILL BE SOME INSTABILITY IN THE AFTERNOON BUT IT SHOULD BE MAINLY ISOLATED TO THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY SO IF ANY SHOWERS DO DEVELOP INTO THUNDERSTORMS EXPECT THAT MAINLY TO BE ONLY WEST OF THE ADIRONDACKS TOMORROW. THAT IS MAINLY BECAUSE THE BACK DOOR FRONT WILL PUSH ALL THE WAY INTO THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY AND THE MARITIME AIRMASS SHOULDN`T SUPPORT DEW POINTS HIGH ENOUGH FOR SIGNIFICANT CONVECTIVE INSTABILITY. EXPECT MAX TEMPS TOMORROW TO BE COMPLETELY MESOSCALE DRIVEN AS THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY WILL WARM UNDER MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES INITIALLY INTO THE LOW 80S WHEREAS THE AREAS BEHIND THE BACKDOOR FRONT ALONG THE VERMONT/NEW HAMPSHIRE BORDER WILL STRUGGLE TO REACH 70S WITH UPPER 60S MORE LIKELY. ADDITIONALLY WITH THE LAKE TEMPS STILL JUST AROUND 50 I EXPECT TEMPS IN AND AROUND THE BROAD LAKE IN THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY TO BE A GOOD 3-5 DEGREES F COOLER TOMORROW THAN THE REST OF THE VALLEY. THERE WILL BE A STRONG NEARLY 15 DEGREE EAST/WEST TEMPERATURE GRADIENT IN THE MAX TEMPS TOMORROW.  AS THE SURFACE LOW AND CORRESPONDING FRONTAL SYSTEM PUSH EAST TOMORROW EVENING WE WILL SEE SHOWERS MOVE INTO THE REST OF THE REGION EARLY MONDAY EVENING AND PERSIST OVERNIGHT AS THE PREFRONTAL SHORT WAVE PASSES THROUGH THE AREA. THEN MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE RAIN CHANCES WILL DROP OFF FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING BEFORE THE FRONT ACTUALLY ARRIVES. AS THE FRONT DOES MOVE INTO THE AREA TUESDAY MORNING THE HIRES MODELS DEPICT CONVECTIVE SHOWERS RAMPING UP QUITE QUICKLY MAINLY EAST OF THE ADIRONDACKS WHERE A NARROW RIBBON OF >1000 J/KG OF CAPE WILL PROVIDE ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO PRODUCE SOME DECENTLY STRONG THUNDERSTORMS OVER NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VERMONT. THE 0-6KM BULK SHEAR WILL BE CLOSE TO 30KTS SO WHERE THE INTERSECTION OF GOOD SHEAR AND THE NARROW RIBBON OF CAPE ARE THERE SHOULD BE SOME DECENT CONVECTIVE SHOWERS THAT DEVELOP.  BEHIND THAT FRONT TEMPS WILL CRASH INTO THE UPPER 30S TO UPPER 40S FOR OVERNIGHT LOWS WITH THE COLDEST TEMPS BEING IN THE NORTHERN ADIRONDACKS APPROACHING FROST CONDITIONS FOR THE NORTHERN ADIRONDACKS.   
CONVECTION HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME DEVELOPING THIS AFTERNOON ALONG THE SOUTHERN TIER. DIFFUSE BOUNDARY REMAINS IN PLACE WITH PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 60S. INSTABILITY HAS INCREASED THROUGH THE DAY AND HAS BECOME SURFACE BASED...WITH A PARCEL OF 75F/60F YIELDING NEAR 1000 J/KG OF CAPE...SO WILL STILL HAVE TO MONITOR THE SOUTHERN TIER FOR CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON AND INTO THE EARLY EVENING. HOWEVER... INFLUX OF DRIER AIR FROM THE NORTH MAY CONTINUE TO LIMIT THE ACTIVITY...WHICH IS SUGGESTED BY SOME OF THE HIGHER RESOLUTION MODELS.  ANY CONVECTION THAT CAN MANAGE TO DEVELOP INTO THIS EVENING WILL DIE OFF WITH THE HEATING CYCLE LATER THIS EVENING. MUGGY AIRMASS WILL REMAIN IN PLACE WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 60S ACROSS WESTERN NEW YORK TO THE MID 50S FOR THE NORTH COUNTRY. THIS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE COMBINED WITH LIGHT WINDS WILL ONCE AGAIN BRING THE POTENTIAL FOR AREAS OF FOG OVERNIGHT...PERHAPS EVEN SOME DENSE FOG ALONG THE SOUTHERN TIER FOR AREAS WHICH RECEIVE ANY RAINFALL.  A DEEP LAYER SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL REMAIN FIRMLY IN PLACE ACROSS THE LOWER LAKES MONDAY. THE REGION WILL BE LARGELY OUTSIDE THE MAIN HEIGHT FALL CENTER AND ASSOCIATED UPPER JET CORE ATTENDANT TO THE CLOSED LOW MEANDERING ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS. ANY EARLY DAY STRATUS DEBRIS WILL GET MIXED OUT INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD FOR SEEING A GOOD BIT OF SUN BY THE MIDDAY PERIOD. THIS SHOULD YIELD A SOLID DIURNAL TEMPERATURE RESPONSE WITH HIGHS MAKING A DECENT RUN AT THE LOWER TO MID 80S...ESPECIALLY ACROSS INTERIOR SECTIONS OF THE GENESEE VALLEY AND FINGER LAKES.  COLD FRONTAL TIMING LOOKS TO BE CENTERED BEYOND THIS PERIOD. THEREFORE WE WILL NEED SOME OTHER FORCING MECHANISM TO CAPITALIZE UPON WHAT SHOULD BE A MODERATELY UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT WITH MLCAPES NEARING 2000 J/KG DURING PEAK HEATING. IT IS LIKELY THAT A PRE- FRONTAL TROUGH AXIS AND LAKE BREEZE CONVERGENCE WILL BE THE PRIMARY FOCUS REGIONS FOR CONVECTION.  IT APPEARS THAT THE STRONGER MID LEVEL WIND FIELDS WILL RESIDE BEHIND THE FRONT...KEEPING SHEAR PROFILES RATHER WEAK. THIS WILL BRING THE POTENTIAL FOR SLOW MOVING CELLS AND LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINFALL...ESPECIALLY IF ANY TRAINING CELLS EMERGE.  
VFR CONDITIONS WILL REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON. SCT CLDS EXPECTED AT KART ARND KROC. CIGS 3-5K FEET EXPECT AT KBUF/KIAG AND KJHW. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP DURING THE AFTERNOON ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER WITH POSSIBLE RESTRICTIONS DEVELOPING IN HEAVIER SHOWERS. THE BEST TIMING FOR THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE FROM 20Z TO 00Z.  WINDS WILL REMAIN LIGHT AND VARIABLE THROUGH TONIGHT.  ANY PCPN FROM THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING WILL END TONIGHT WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING AND WITH NO FORCING MECHANISM. AREAS OF IFR FOG WILL AGAIN BE POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHICH PICK UP RAIN.  OUTLOOK... MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...VFR/MVFR WITH SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LIKELY. TUESDAY...VFR/MVFR WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS. WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...VFR.  
HAVE 250-500 J/KG OF CAPE OVER THE LOWER HUDSON VALLEY/NE NJ/MOST OF NYC. THIS ENERGY COUPLED BY FORCING ASSOCIATED BY A SHORTWAVE CURRENTLY OVER SW QUEBEC/W NY DIVING SE OVER THE TOP OF THE RIDGE WARRANT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THIS EVENING OVER THIS AREA.  OTHERWISE EXPECT CLOUDS TO INCREASE FROM E TO W BEHIND THE BACKDOOR COLD FRONT...WITH PATCHY FOG/DRIZZLE DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT FROM W TO E AS WELL.  FOR LOWS USED A BLEND OF MAV/MET/ECS GUIDANCE WITH NAM 2-METER TEMPERATURES. LOWS SHOULD BE AROUND 10 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.  
VFR CONDITIONS THROUGH THIS EVENING. A COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE TERMINALS LATE TONIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING FROM THE NORTHEAST.  SOUTHERLY SEA BREEZES CONTINUE MOVING THROUGH MOST TERMINALS. SPEEDS WILL BE 5 TO 10 KT...HIGHEST NEAR THE COAST. AT KSWF...WINDS LIKELY STAY LIGHT AND VARIABLE THROUGH TONIGHT.  AN ISOLATED SHOWER IS POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON AT KEWR/KTEB.  WINDS DIMINISH TO 5 KT OR LESS AFTER 02-03Z TIME FRAME. BEHIND THE FRONT...WINDS WILL BE OUT OF THE NE-ENE 5 TO 10 KT MONDAY MORNING.  STRATUS/FOG DEVELOPS AROUND 09Z WITH IFR CONDITIONS AND A LOW CHANCE OF LIFR IN VISIBILITIES. SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT TO MVFR EXPECTED AROUND 15Z...BUT IFR CONDITIONS COULD LAST LONGER THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST.  
GENERALLY LIGHT RAINFALL AMOUNTS ARE POSSIBLE IN ANY SHOWERS INTO THIS EVENING. HOWEVER...ANY SHOWERS WHICH DO FORM INTO THIS AFTERNOON WILL MOVE VERY SLOWLY. IF ANY STRONGER CONVECTION WERE TO FORM OVER A LOCATION...THERE WOULD BE THE POTENTIAL FOR THE PONDING OF WATER ON ROADWAYS AND POSSIBLY MINOR POOR DRAINAGE FLOODING DEPENDING ON THE EXACT DURATION AND STRENGTH OF ANY GIVEN SHOWER WHICH MIGHT FORM.  FROM ONE TO THREE TENTHS OF AN INCH OF RAIN IS POSSIBLE FROM LATE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING. LITTLE OR NO HYDROLOGIC IMPACT IS EXPECTED.  NO PRECIPITATION IS THEN EXPECTED THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK.  
A STATIONARY FRONT OVER SOUTHERN PENNSYLVANIA MAY SPUR AN ISOLATED SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM OVER THE WYOMING VALLEY THROUGH THIS EVENING. THE FRONT WILL MOVE NORTH MONDAY AFTERNOON INTO TUESDAY, BRINGING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO MUCH OF NY AND PA.  
230 PM UPDATE... A THIN AREA OF 500 J/KG MLCAPE EXTENDS INTO THE SOUTHERN FA THIS AFTERNOON, AND THIS IS THE AREA WHICH HAS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A THUNDERSTORM THROUGH SUNSET. OTHERWISE SKIES WILL BE PARTLY SUNNY WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S.  10 AM UPDATE... FOG HAS DISSIPATED AS PREVIOUSLY FORECAST, AND HENCE REMOVED FROM THE GRIDS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING HOURS.  FRONT REMAINS DRAPED ACROSS PA THIS MORNING WITH A LINE OF SHOWERS EXTENDING FROM SC PA INTO THE MID ATLANTIC REGION. SHOULD CONVECTION FIRE THIS AFTERNOON, BELIEVE THE MOST LIKELY TARGET AREA WILL BE FROM BRADFORD COUNTY SOUTHEAST TOWARD PIKE. NAM AVP SOUNDING PROG GENERATES 500-700 J/KG OF SBCAPE BY LATE AFTERNOON, COMBINED WITH WEAK BULK SHEAR (~15 KNOTS).  FORECAST IN GOOD SHAPE WITH ONLY MINOR TEMPERATURE ADJUSTMENTS MADE THIS MORNING.  
A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE NORTH THIS AFTERNOON...THEN DROPS SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT. THE FRONT STALLS JUST SOUTHWEST OF THE REGION ON MONDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN FROM THE NORTHEAST. THIS FRONT WILL LIFT THROUGH AS A WARM FRONT TUESDAY MORNING...FOLLOWED BY A COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE TUESDAY EVENING. HIGH PRESSURE IS THEN IN CONTROL INTO NEXT WEEKEND...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A WEAK COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE ON FRIDAY  
LOOKING AT DEVELOPING CUMULUS FIELD ON SATELLITE OVER THE LOWER HUDSON VALLEY/NE NJ...SO AT THIS POINT HAVE NO REASON TO NOT BELIEVE HRRR IDEA OF ISOLATED SHOWERS DEVELOPING THERE THIS AFTERNOON.  WHILE ANY SHRA...WITH VERY LOW CHANCE OF A TSTM...WILL BE OF THE HIT AND MISS VARIETY...GIVEN LIGHT WINDS ALOFT WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE...SO COULD PRODUCE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. ONCE AGAIN...FAR MORE LIKELY FOR A MISS THAN A HIT ON A SHRA AT ANY GIVEN LOCATION OVER THE LOWER HUDSON VALLEY/NE NJ/NYC THIS AFTERNOON.  MADE MINOR CHANGES TO TEMPERATURES THIS UPDATE WITH VALUES EXPECTED TO BE AROUND 10-15 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL AS A RESULT.  SEABREEZES HAVE DEVELOPED A TAD AHEAD OF SCHEDULE...BUT BASED ON LATEST TRENDS SHOULD BE SLOW TO MOVE INLAND...ESPECIALLY ACROSS LONG ISLAND/NYC.  
UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AXIS BUILDS EAST ACROSS NEW ENGLAND TONIGHT...WHICH IN TURN STRENGTHENS HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE CANADIAN MARITIMES AND SENDS A BACKDOOR COLD ACROSS THE AREA BY DAYBREAK. THE FRONT WILL STALL JUST SOUTHWEST OF THE FORECAST AREA ON MON. HOWEVER..DUE TO THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE BOUNDARY CAN NOT RULE OUT SHOWERS...PRIMARILY FROM NYC AND POINTS WEST. CLOUDS MOVE IN BEHIND THE COLD FRONT LATE TONIGHT AS A MOIST E FLOW DEVELOPS ACROSS THE REGION. SOME CLEARING IS POSSIBLE MON AFTERNOON ACROSS EASTERN LONG ISLAND/SE CT...WITH A MOSTLY CLOUDY SKY FURTHER WEST.  LOWS TONIGHT WILL REMAIN MILD WITH THE CLOUD COVER AND DEVELOPING EAST FLOW...HOWEVER...FOR THOSE SAME REASONS WILL BE ABOUT 5 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL ON MON.  
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE H5 PATTERN THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. A VORTEX DEVELOPS OVER SE CANADA AT THE END OF THE WEEK WITH ZONAL FLOW BECOMING SW ALOFT AS A PIECE OF ENERGY MOVING AROUND THE BASE RESULTS IN AMPLIFICATION.  WARM FRONT LIFTS THROUGH TUE MORNING FOLLOWED BY A COLD FRONT IN THE EVE WITH A BETTER CHANCE FOR WIDESPREAD SHOWERS/TSTMS. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS IN FROM THE W AND REMAINS IN CONTROL THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAYBE A SHOWER ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK COLD FRONT DROPPING THROUGH THE AREA ON FRI AFTERNOON/EVE.  TEMPERATURES WILL GENERALLY BE ABOVE NORMAL LEVELS THROUGH THE PERIOD.  
A COLD FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE NORTH TODAY WITH VFR CONDITIONS THROUGH THIS EVENING. THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE TERMINALS LATE TONIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING.  WITH LIGHT FLOW OVER THE AREA...WINDS HAVE BEEN VARIABLE. SOUTHERLY SEA BREEZES WILL CONTINUE MOVING THROUGH MOST TERMINALS. OTHERWISE...WINDS SHOULD AVERAGE OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST WHERE SEA BREEZES DO NOT MOVE THROUGH. SPEEDS WILL BE 5 TO 10 KT...HIGHEST NEAR THE COAST.  AN ISOLATED SHOWER IS POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON AT KEWR/KTEB.  WINDS DIMINISH TO 5 KT OR LESS AFTER 02-03Z TIME FRAME. BEHIND THE FRONT...WINDS WILL BE OUT OF THE NE-ENE 5 TO 10 KT MONDAY MORNING.  STRATUS/FOG DEVELOPS AROUND 09Z WITH IFR CONDS AND A LOW CHANCE OF LIFR IN VISIBILITIES. SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT TO MVFR EXPECTED AROUND 15Z...BUT IFR CONDS COULD LAST LONGER THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST.  
MADE MINOR CHANGES THIS UPDATE TO REFLECT THE LATEST TRENDS IN OBSERVATIONS AND GUIDANCE. THE FORECAST APPEARS ON TRACK.  A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE WATERS FROM THE NORTH THIS AFTERNOON AND PASSES TO SOUTH OF THE WATERS BY EARLY MONDAY MORNING. THE PRESSURE GRADIENT GRADUALLY TIGHTENS AS HIGH PRES BUILDS ALONG THE NEW ENGLAND COAST AND A COLD FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE WEST. THAT FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE WATERS LATE TUESDAY...AND THEN HIGH PRES RETURNS FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK.  SUB-SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS ON TAP THROUGH MONDAY...AND THEN SCA CONDITIONS EXPECTED ON WEDNESDAY BEHIND THE DEPARTING COLD FRONT.  
GENERALLY LIGHT RAINFALL AMOUNTS ARE POSSIBLE IN ANY SHOWERS THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...MAINLY WEST OF NYC.  HOWEVER...ANY SHOWERS WHICH DO FORM THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE VERY SLOW TO MOVE. IF ANY STRONGER CONVECTION WERE TO FORM OVER A LOCATION...THERE WOULD BE THE POTENTIAL FOR THE PONDING OF WATER ON ROADWAYS AND POSSIBLY MINOR POOR DRAINAGE FLOODING DEPENDING ON THE EXACT DURATION AND STRENGTH OF ANY GIVEN SHOWER WHICH MIGHT FORM.  AROUND 1/4 OF AN INCH OF RAINFALL IS POSSIBLE WITH THE FRONTAL SYSTEM ON TUE.  
CLOUDS THIS MORNING WILL GIVE WAY TO SUNSHINE AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ACROSS THE AREA. THE NEXT CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL BEGIN LATE MONDAY AS A COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE REGION. THE FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH LATE TUESDAY...AND TEMPERATURES WILL TREND BELOW NORMAL FOR THE LATTER PART OF THE WEEK.  
AS OF 134 PM EDT SUNDAY... A PLEASANT DAY IS UNFOLDING WITH TEMPS ACROSS THE AREA WARMING INTO THE MID 70S ACROSS THE NORTH COUNTRY TODAY UNDER MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND CALM TO LIGHT NORTHERLY FLOW. ONLY MINOR CHANGE WAS TO BLEND IN SOME OF THE SHORT RANGE HIRES WINDOWS FOR SKY COVER TO CONTINUE THE DRYING TREND IN THE MID LEVELS THIS AFTERNOON. ALL IN ALL A GREAT DAY TO BE OUTSIDE ENJOYING THE NORTH COUNTRY TODAY.  PREVIOUS DISCUSSION AS OF 1029 AM SUNDAY...VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWS THE LOW LEVEL STRATUS FROM THIS MORNING HAS BEGUN TO ERODE LEAVING BEHIND A SCATTERED CUMULUS FIELD MAINLY OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE ADIRONDACKS AND THE GREEN MOUNTAINS. WITH THE CLEARING OVER THE CHAMPLAIN AND SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEYS TEMPS HAVE STARTED TO CREEP UP IN TO THE LOW 70S ALREADY SO I WENT AHEAD AND BUMPED UP THE TEMPS OVER THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY A FEW DEGREES. I REMOVED THE PATCHY FOG FROM THE FORECAST AS NONE OF THE OBS ARE CURRENTLY REPORTING ANY BR. THE REST OF THE FORECAST LOOKS GOOD TO GO WITH NO OTHER CHANGES NEEDED.  
AS OF 415 AM EDT SUNDAY...THE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE NEARLY OVERHEAD OVERNIGHT, AND THE COMBINATION OF CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS WILL ALLOW GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING. DEW POINTS IN THE UPPER 40S TO LOW 50S WILL LIMIT OVERNIGHT LOWS TO A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN NORMAL. SOUTHERLY RETURN FLOW WILL ALSO BEGIN BY MONDAY MORNING AS HIGH SHIFTS TO THE EAST, WHICH WILL ALSO OFFSET RADIATIONAL COOLING.  BY MONDAY AFTERNOON EXPECT TO SEE WIND INCREASE TO 15-25 MPH ESPECIALLY IN NORTH-SOUTH ORIENTED VALLEYS IN THE CENTRAL AND WESTERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA WHERE TEMPERATURES RISE BACK INTO THE UPPER 70S TO LOW 80S. IN EASTERN VERMONT A BACK DOOR COLD FRONT WILL MOVE IN AS THE SURFACE RIDGE SHIFTS EAST, DIRECTING EASTERLY MARITIME FLOW INTO THE REGION. STRONG EAST/WEST TEMPERATURE GRADIENT WITH EASTERN VERMONT ONLY INTO THE 60S AND LOW 70S ON MONDAY.  A SURFACE LOW WILL APPROACH FROM THE GREAT LAKES REGION MONDAY AFTERNOON AND OVERNIGHT. WILL SEE SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MONDAY AFTERNOON IN THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY AND WESTERN ADIRONDACKS AS THE FRONT APPROACHES. THERE WILL BE SOME WEAK INSTABILITY IN THE AREA...CAPES AROUND 800-1200 J/KG, AND HAVE THUNDER IN THE FORECAST MONDAY AND EARLY MONDAY NIGHT. CAPE GOES AWAY WITH LOSS OF SURFACE HEATING LATE MONDAY. HAVE A RELATIVE MINIMUM IN POPS DURING THE MORNING TUESDAY AFTER PREFRONTAL WAVE PASSES, THE POPS RAMP UP AGAIN WITH PASSAGE OF COLD FRONT FROM WEST TO EAST DURING THE DAY TUESDAY. SURFACE BASED CAPES INCREASE OVER 1000 J/KG AGAIN ON TUESDAY IN A NARROW BAND ALONG/AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT, WITH THUNDER IN THE FORECAST.  
AS OF 415 AM EDT SUNDAY...SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVES DOWN FROM CANADA TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING AND BRINGS QUITE A BIT OF CLOUD COVER AND A CHANCE OF SHOWERS WITH IT...ESPECIALLY OVER THE MOUNTAINS. RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL GENERALLY BE LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN INCH. IN ADDITION... TEMPERATURES WILL BE A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. EVENTUALLY DRIER AIR MOVES IN LATER WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK ON WEST TO NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. MORE SUNSHINE SHOULD LEAD TO WARMER TEMPERATURES...BUT READINGS WILL ONLY BE RIGHT AROUND SEASONAL NORMALS.  
MOST OF THE REGION WILL BE DRY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEKEND...THOUGH A FEW SHOWERS AND PERHAPS A THUNDERSTORM ARE STILL POSSIBLE MAINLY SOUTH OF THE TWIN TIERS TODAY. WARM HUMID AIR MONDAY FOLLOWED BY A MOIST COLD FRONT INTO TUESDAY...WILL RESULT IN SHOWERS AND A CHANCE OF THUNDER. THIS WILL BRING IN COOLER WEATHER FOR WEDNESDAY.  
10 AM UPDATE... FOG HAS DISSIPATED AS PREVIOUSLY FORECAST, AND HENCE REMOVED FROM THE GRIDS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING HOURS.  FRONT REMAINS DRAPED ACROSS PA THIS MORNING WITH A LINE OF SHOWERS EXTENDING FROM SC PA INTO THE MID ATLANTIC REGION. SHOULD CONVECTION FIRE THIS AFTERNOON, BELIEVE THE MOST LIKELY TARGET AREA WILL BE FROM BRADFORD COUNTY SOUTHEAST TOWARD PIKE. NAM AVP SOUNDING PROG GENERATES 500-700 J/KG OF SBCAPE BY LATE AFTERNOON, COMBINED WITH WEAK BULK SHEAR (~15 KNOTS).  FORECAST IN GOOD SHAPE WITH ONLY MINOR TEMPERATURE ADJUSTMENTS MADE THIS MORNING.  2 AM EDT UPDATE... IN WAKE OF SHORTWAVE WHICH YIELDED CLUSTERS OF THUNDERSTORMS SATURDAY...SHALLOW SURFACE BOUNDARY HAS SAGGED INTO NORTHEAST PA WITH LINGERING SCATTERED SHOWERS. MEANWHILE...FOG IS DEVELOPING ACROSS THE TWIN TIERS TO AT LEAST AS FAR NORTH AS PENN YAN- ITHACA-NORWICH-ONEONTA...BASICALLY FOR AREAS WHERE RAIN FELL EARLIER. CLOUDS IN THIS AREA HAVE HAD BREAKS...AND ALSO MOISTURE TRAPPED UNDER SHALLOW FRONTAL INVERSION IS KEEPING DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW 60S...SO EXPECT THIS FOG TO CONTINUE UNTIL MIXING OCCURS AFTER SUNRISE.  REMAINS OF FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL LOSE DEFINITION TODAY...GETTING WASHED OUT AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE REGION. MOST OF OUR REGION WILL BECOME FAIRLY STABLE...AND DRY WITH FAIR AMOUNT OF SUN ESPECIALLY TOWARDS CENTRAL NEW YORK. THERE WILL STILL BE A CHANCE OF A FEW SHOWERS AND PERHAPS AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM FROM STEUBEN COUNTY NY TO BRADFORD-WYOMING-LUZERNE COUNTIES PA...BUT EVEN IN THESE AREAS MAINLY DRY. ON THE WARM SIDE AS WELL WITH HIGHS IN MID 70S TO LOW 80S.  MOSTLY QUIET TONIGHT AS UPPER RIDGE MOVES OVER THE REGION. UPPER- MID LEVEL MOISTURE WILL INCREASE LATE AS APEX OF RIDGE PASSES...AND ALLOWS MOIST SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT TO GET STARTED INTO MONDAY MORNING. SO WE CAN EXPECT CLOUDS TO INCREASE TOWARDS DAWN. MILD LOWS IN UPPER 50S TO MID 60S.  
4 AM SUN UPDATE... THE MAIN FOCUS FOR CONVECTIVE DVLPMT APPEARS TO BE FROM MON AFTN...THROUGH MON NGT...AND INTO TUE...AHD OF A SFC FRNTL COMPLEX AND SLOWLY IMPINGING UPR-LVL TROUGH. THUS...POPS WILL RAMP UPWARD INTO THE LIKELY RANGE THIS PD.  MON AFTN AND NGT...A NNE TO SSW ORIENTED WARM FRNT WILL BE GRADUALLY EDGING EWD THROUGH NY AND PA. DUE TO THE PROXIMITY OF THIS BNDRY...THE MODELS CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE THE IDEA OF A TIGHT TEMP GRADIENT ACRS THE FA MON...WITH HIGHS RANGING FROM NEAR 70 OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE CATSKILLS...TO WELL INTO THE 80S OVER THE FINGER LAKES RGN. ALTHOUGH THE WARM HUMID AMS ALG AND W OF THIS WARM FRNT WILL DESTABILIZE THE ENVIRONMENT MON AFTN AND EVE...OVERALL THE CAPE PROFILES LOOK TALL AND SKINNY IN NATURE...WITH ML CAPES MOST LIKELY IN THE 500-1000 J/KG RANGE. ALSO DEEP-LYRD SHEAR IS QUITE MARGINAL (GENERALLY 0-6 KM VALUES AOB 20 KT). THUS...THE THREAT FOR ORGANIZED SVR STORMS SEEMS QUITE LOW.  HOWEVER...THE THREAT FOR LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL CONTINUES TO LOOK MORE CONCRETE. A HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT AMS (ANOMALOUS PWAT VALUES NEARING 1.75") AND ELEVATED WARM CLOUD DEPTHS (10-12K FT) POINT TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF VERY EFFICIENT RAIN PRODUCING STORMS. ALSO...SHORT MBE VECTORS MON AFTN AND EVE WOULD ALSO RAISE THE THREAT OF SLOW MOVING AND/OR TRAINING CELLS. DESPITE MORE RECENT RAINFALL...WE HAVE BEEN DRY LONG-TERM...WITH THRIVING VEGETATION ALSO EAGER TO SOAK UP ANY ADDITIONAL RAINS WE GET. THESE FACTORS SHOULD HELP US. JUST THE SAME THOUGH...WITH THE HEAVY RAINFALL SIGNALS EARLIER MENTIONED HAVING BEEN CONSISTENTLY ADVERTISED FOR THE LAST SVRL MODEL CYCLES...PLUS AN OVERALL SYSTEM HISTORY OF HEAVY RAIN/FLASH FLOODING UPSTREAM...WE`LL CONTINUE TO MENTION LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS IN THE HWO.  BY TUE...THE MAIN COLD FRNT IS PROGGED TO SWEEP THROUGH CNY/NE PA FROM NW TO SE. TIMING OF THIS FEATURE STILL REMAINS AN ISSUE...WITH THE EC/GFS GENERALLY FASTER WITH THE FROPA (12-18Z FOR MUCH OF OUR CWA) AND THE NAM/GEM SOMEWHAT SLOWER. GIVEN THE EXPECTATION OF DRIER AIR ALOFT AND SOMEWHAT BETTER SHEAR BY TUE AFTN...ANY STORM THREATS WOULD PROBABLY SHIFT MORE TO WIND/HAIL BY THEN...AS OPPOSED TO HEAVY RAIN. HOWEVER...A MORE RAPID FROPA (AS INDICATED BY THE EC/GFS) WOULD EVEN MITIGATE THIS CONCERN...WITH PRESUMABLY INADEQUATE TIME FOR SIGNIFICANT DESTABILIZATION. WE`LL SIMPLY HAVE TO TAKE A WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE. FOR NOW...WE HAVE LIKELY POPS EARLY IN THE DAY...LESSENING WITH TIME FROM W TO E.  IT STILL APPEARS THAT MUCH COOLER AIR WILL DESCEND UPON THE RGN STARTING TUE NGT...THEN LASTING INTO THE START OF THE LONG-TERM.  
A VERY QUIET PD WITH A WNW FLOW ALOFT AND BLDG SFC HIPRES. THIS WILL RESULT IN GNRLY DRY AND SLGTY COOLER THAN NRML WX FOR THE LONG TERM. ONLY REAL WX ITEM TO DISCUSS IS A SCNDRY COLD FNT SLIDING INTO NEW ENG ON FRI WHICH PTNLY COULD TRIGGER A FEW SHWRS OVER THE ERN AREAS FRI AFNT. HAVE GONE WITH THE DRY HPC GUID FOR NOW BUT THIS PSBLTY CANNOT BE RULED OUT. BEYOND THAT...A LRG SFC BLDS IN BHD THE FNT AND DRY AND COOL WX WILL CONT THRU THE END OF THE PD...AND BEYOND.  
FNTL BNDRY WHICH CAUSED YSRTDY/S SHWRS AND TSTMS HAS STALLED WELL SOUTH OF THE AREA...BUT IS STILL RESULTING IN A VFR CLD DECK AT AVP. THIS FNT WILL GATHER ITSELF AND TAKE ANOTHER RUN AT THE AREA AFTER THE END OF THE TAF PD. IN THE MEANTIME...VFR CONDS WILL CONT THRU THE DAY TODAY AND INTO THIS EVENING. LTR TNGT...LL MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO INCRS AND RESULT IN SOME MVFR CIGS AND VSBYS...MAINLY SOUTH OF RME AND SYR. THERE WILL BE SOME IMPRVMT MON MRNG BEFORE THE END OF THE PD. XPCT LGT WINDS THRU THE PD.  
430 AM SUN UPDATE... ONCE AGN...NO SIG CHANGES TO THE LONG TERM FCST ATTM.  AN EASTERN CANADIAN/NERN U.S. TROUGH SHOULD KEEP TEMPS ON THE COOL SIDE WED-THU...WITH MODERATION LIKELY THEREAFTER. IF CLEAR SKIES/GOOD RADIATING CONDS CAN DVLP (WHICH SEEMS QUESTIONABLE AT THIS POINT) WED NGT OR THU NGT...AT LEAST LOCALIZED FROST WOULD BE PSBL. THIS IS SOMETHING WE`LL BE WATCHING OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  PREV DISC... THE EXTENDED PERIOD BEGINS WITH AN UNSEASONABLY COOL, DRY TROF DROPPING OUT OF CANADA ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. A MEAN TROF SETS UP OVER THE NORTHEAST THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD, THOUGH THE HEIGHT PATTERN IS RATHER FLAT ACROSS NY/PA.  EXCEPT FOR A FEW LINGERING SPRINKLES OR LIGHT SHOWERS OVER THE FAR NORTHEAST TUESDAY NIGHT, THE ENTIRE PERIOD LOOKS DRY. THE BEST SHOT OF COOL AIR COMES THROUGH ON WEDNESDAY, THOUGH THE ECMWF 925MB TEMP PROGS ARE WARMER THAN YESTERDAY`S RUN AROUND 3C-4C. YESTERDAY`S RUN FORECAST CLOSER TO 0C.  AFTER A COOLISH WEDNESDAY WITH MAX TEMPS NEAR 60F, IT WILL BE CHILLY WEDNESDAY NIGHT, BUT SO FAR IT APPEARS TOO WARM FOR FROST.  TEMPS REBOUND LATE IN THE WEEK, HANGING JUST SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL.  
NEAR THE UTAH BORDER TODAY. OTHERWISE...EXPECT DRIER AND WARMER CONDITIONS TO RETURN THROUGH MIDWEEK. ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BRING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS BACK TO THE REGION FRIDAY...WITH LINGERING SHOWERS POSSIBLE TO THE NORTH ON SATURDAY. 


TO OUR NORTH OVER THE GREAT BASIN TODAY RESULTING IN A MOSTLY DRY WEST TO SOUTHWEST FLOW OVER ARIZONA. THE EXCEPTION WILL BE ACROSS FAR NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE STATE WHERE A FEW INSTABILITY SHOWERS MAY DEVELOP...PRIMARILY FROM GRAND CANYON NORTH TO THE UTAH BORDER. CURRENT FORECAST TRENDS ARE ON TRACK. 
THE AREA EARLIER TODAY IS JUST ABOUT CLEAR OF THE EASTERN BORDER AND INTO NEW MEXICO. DRIER AIR BEHIND THE FRONT WILL ALLOW FOR A MOSTLY SUNNY DAY...ALTHOUGH LINGERING INSTABILITY NEAR THE UTAH BORDER MAY LEAD TO AN ISOLATED SHOWER OR TWO THIS AFTERNOON. DRY AND SLIGHTLY WARMER SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL DEVELOP WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AND SHOULD MAKE FOR A PAIR OF NEAR NORMAL MAY DAYS. BY FRIDAY...ANOTHER CLOSED LOW WILL MOVE THROUGH THE LOWER COLORADO RIVER ZONES AND INTO NORTHERN ARIZONA. THIS LOW WILL BRING AREAS OF SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS...BUT SHOULD NOT BE COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW IN ANY POPULATED AREAS. THE LOW WILL QUICKLY MOVE AWAY FOR A MOSTLY DRY AND WARMER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND. 
OF A KGCN-KRQE LINE THROUGH 06Z WEDS WITH SCT-BKN120 MSL CLOUD BASES. OTHERWISE...VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR TAF AMENDMENTS. 
DURING THE AFTERNOONS ALONG WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES 5-7 DEGREES BELOW AVERAGE. THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...SW WINDS WILL PICK UP ON THURSDAY AHEAD OF THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE TROUGH. EXPECT INCREASED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND A CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION ON FRIDAY. LOW PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL CONTINUE INTO SATURDAY WITH BELOW AVERAGE TEMPERATURES. 

CONTINUE TO PASS THROUGH THE REGION MAINLY NORTH OF THE AREA. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR TO BELOW AVERAGE INTO THE WEEKEND. 
BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE GREAT BASIN...WITH A LARGE SWATH OF DRY MID TO UPPER LEVEL AIR OVER MUCH OF THE EASTERN PACIFIC... BAJA...SONORA AND CHIHUAHUA MEXICO...AS WELL AS EXTREME SOUTHERN ARIZONA AND WEST TEXAS. AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM A CLUSTER OF THUNDERSTORMS ARE CURRENTLY OVER THE TEXAS PANHANDLE. CLOSER TO HOME...SKIES ACROSS SOUTHEAST ARIZONA ARE MOSTLY CLEAR. THIS MORNINGS KTWC SOUNDING WAS DRY WITH A PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUE OF ONLY 0.22 INCHES. AS OF 15Z (8 AM MST)...TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE REGION WERE GENERALLY IN THE 60S FOR DESERT/VALLEY LOCATIONS. THESE READINGS SEEM TO BE ON TRACK WITH EXPECTED AFTERNOON HIGH TEMPS...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND WILL MAKE CHANGES AS NEEDED. OTHERWISE...THE FORECAST FOR THE REMAINDER OF TODAY IS ON TRACK. 
LIGHT MORNING WINDS...THEN SW WINDS REDEVELOPING THIS AFTERNOON 10- 15 KTS WITH GUSTS TO 25 KT. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR TAF AMENDMENTS. 
COMING WEEKEND WITH SEVERAL WINDY PERIODS. LIGHTER WINDS AND COOLER TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TODAY AND WEDNESDAY HOWEVER DEWPOINTS WILL BE LOWER WITH SINGLE DIGIT MIN RH`S BECOMING FAIRLY WIDESPREAD ACROSS LOWER ELEVATIONS OF ZONES 151 AND 152 BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. YET ANOTHER UPPER LOW WILL APPROACH CALIFORNIA LATER WEDNESDAY WITH AN ASSOCIATED UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE PASSING ACROSS THE AREA LATE THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY RESULTING IN STRONG GUSTY WINDS. IN COMBINATION WITH LOWER HUMIDITIES AND DRYING FUELS WE MAY SEE CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS BY FRIDAY AND PERHAPS AS EARLY AS THURSDAY AFTERNOON. 
LATITUDE IMPULSES IS EXITING INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS LEAVING SEVERAL DEGREES OF COOLING BEHIND. HEIGHT AND THICKNESS VALUES WILL REBOUND WITH A STRONG WARMING TREND WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. THE NEXT IMPULSE DIGGING INTO THE BASE OF THE MEAN TROUGH POSITION OVER THE REGION WILL MOVE IN FROM THE WEST THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. NOT MUCH CHANCE OF PRECIP THIS FAR SOUTH...BUT STRONG GUSTY WINDS WILL RETURN BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON. 
MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE FORECAST TODAY AND WEDNESDAY. ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL APPROACH THE REGION THURSDAY...BRINGING CONTINUED COOLER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES...INCREASING CLOUD COVER...AND BREEZY TO LOCALLY WINDY CONDITIONS THAT WILL LAST THROUGH FRIDAY. A SUBTLE WARMING TREND AND DRY SURFACE CONDITIONS WILL TAKE US THROUGH THE COMING WEEKEND. 
WATER VAPOR SATELLITE IMAGERY AND REGIONAL UPPER AIR PLOTS REVEAL A BROAD UPPER LEVEL TROUGH CURRENTLY CENTERED OVER THE GREAT BASIN. THE TROUGH EXTENDS WEST ACROSS THE EASTERN PACIFIC TO AROUND 130W WHERE THE UPPER LEVEL JET IS BEGINNING TO CARVE OUT A DEEPER SEGMENT TO THE TROUGH. MODELS ARE IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT THAT SHORT WAVE RIDGING OVER THE CENTRAL CONUS WILL EVENTUALLY DEEPEN THE CURRENT TROUGH TO AROUND 25N AND RETRO IT SLIGHTLY OFF THE PACIFIC COAST BY THURSDAY. THIS WILL BE OUR NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM THAT WILL BRING US AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS...WIDESPREAD BREEZY CONDITIONS...AND SLIGHT PRECIPITATION CHANCES FOR THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. FOR NOW...A DRIER WEST-SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT OVER THE DESERT SOUTHWEST WILL CONTINUE TO BRING MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND WARMER TEMPERATURES TO OUR FORECAST TODAY AND WEDNESDAY. DAYTIME TEMPS OVER THE LOWER DESERTS WILL PEAK BACK INTO THE LOW 90S. THE INHERITED SHORT TERM DIGITAL FORECAST/GRIDS LOOK TO BE IN STEP WITH OB/MODEL TRENDS. PREVIOUS DISCUSSION STILL APPLIES. PREVIOUS DISCUSSION... THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...THE NEXT PACIFIC TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO MOVE ON-SHORE INTO CALIFORNIA THURSDAY. MOISTURE PROFILE AND JET SPEED/ORIENTATION WITH THIS NEXT SYSTEM APPEAR SIMILAR TO THE ONE EXITING THE AREA TODAY. NARROW RIBBON OF N-S ELEVATED MIXING RATIOS AND PWATS BEGIN TO BE DRAWN INTO THE COLORADO RIVER VALLEY THURSDAY. FCST PWATS RANGE FROM 0.5 TO 0.75 INCHES WITH A LARGE PORTION OF THIS MOISTURE AT OR ABOVE 650MB. SOUTHWESTERLY UL JET...PUSHING 100KTS AND IN THE NAEFS UPPER 90TH PERCENTILES FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...WILL TRANSITION INTO THE AREA THURSDAY...SUPPORTING ANOTHER ROUND OF BREEZY TO LOCALLY WINDY CONDITIONS. ANOTHER COOL DOWN AFTER THE TROUGH AXIS PASSAGE WILL RESULT FRIDAY AND THROUGH THE EARLY WEEKEND...KNOCKING TEMPERATURES DOWN INTO THE 80S AND EVEN A FEW 70 DEGREES READINGS ACROSS SOUTHEAST CA. NEXT WEEK...LONGWAVE TROUGHING WILL HAVE A HOLD OVER THE WESTERN U.S. AS ADDITIONAL STORM SYSTEMS SKIRT THROUGH THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST AND GREAT BASIN. INFLUENCE OF TROUGHING WILL BE LESS NOTICEABLE ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST...ALLOWING FOR ML AND UL THICKNESSES TO RETURN TO MORE SEASONAL VALUES. SFC TEMPERATURES WILL WARM AS A RESULT...RETURNING 90 DEGREE READINGS TO AREA FOR AT LEAST A PORTION OF THE WEEK. THE EFFECT OF THE UL SPLIT-FLOW PATTERN LOOKS TO REMAIN A LITTLE WHILE LONGER...AS ADDITIONAL TROUGHING MAY BRUSH PAST AT LEAST THROUGH THE WESTERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR MIDWEEK. OVERALL...CONDITIONS LOOK TO MOSTLY REMAIN ON THE DRY SIDE WITH GOOD CHANCES FOR TEMPERATURES AT OR JUST BELOW SEASONAL NORMALS. 
SOUTH-CENTRAL ARIZONA INCLUDING KPHX...KIWA...AND KSDL... SOUTHEAST CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHWEST ARIZONA INCLUDING KIPL AND KBLH... DRY WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL RESULT IN MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES RELATIVELY LIGHT WIND. THROUGH 18Z TUE...MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. LIGHT WIND UNDER 7 KNOTS. FROM 18Z TUE TO 02Z WED...MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. WEST TO SOUTHWEST WIND 8 TO 12 KNOTS. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR AMENDED TAFS. 
THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY...A COUPLE OF MOSTLY DRY AND RELATIVELY COOL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. THIS WILL RESULT IN GUSTY AFTERNOON SOUTHWEST WINDS AREA-WIDE 15 TO 25 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 35 MPH THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. DRY WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WITH MUCH LIGHTER AFTERNOON WIND IS EXPECTED SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY. CONTINUED BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES. LITTLE CHANGE IN MINIMUM RH EACH DAY WITH VALUES RANGING FROM 15 TO 20 PERCENT. POOR OVERNIGHT RECOVERY IS EXPECTED FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHTS DUE TO BREEZINESS. GOOD OVERNIGHT RECOVERY SUNDAY AND MONDAY NIGHTS. 
AZ...NONE. CA...NONE. 
MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE FORECAST TODAY AND WEDNESDAY. ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL APPROACH THE REGION FROM CALIFORNIA BEGINNING THURSDAY. RESULTING CONDITIONS WILL BE CONTINUED COOLER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES... INCREASING CLOUD COVER AND BREEZY TO LOCALLY WINDY CONDITIONS FOR THE LATE WEEK. A SUBTLE WARMING TREND AND DRY SURFACE CONDITIONS WILL TAKE US THROUGH THE COMING WEEKEND. 
UPPER TROUGH AXIS AND SFC FRONTAL BAND CONTINUE TO CLEAR TO THE EAST THIS MORNING...GENERATING BROAD AREAS OF CONVECTION ACROSS EASTERN NM... CENTRAL TX AND EASTERN CO. DRY AIR HAS BEEN FILTERING IN AT THE SFC IN THE WAKE OF THE FRONT WITH AREA DEWPOINTS RANGING 5 TO 15 DEGREES DRIER FOR MANY SITES ACROSS THE REGION. ONLY A FEW CU LINGERING OVER FAR EASTERN GILA COUNTY...OTHERWISE 3AM SKIES ARE CLEAR. WE`LL FIND OURSELVES IN BETWEEN WEATHER SYSTEMS WITH SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT TODAY AND WEDNESDAY... CONTINUING OUR MILD AND BELOW-NORMAL TEMPERATURES ALONG WITH MOSTLY LIGHT WINDS AND PERIODS OF PASSING HIGH CLOUDS. LOWER DESERT TEMPERATURES WILL PEAK BACK INTO THE LOW 90S WITH THE FOOTHILL/HIGHER TERRAIN LOCALES IN THE MID 80S. MEANWHILE...ANOTHER PACIFIC TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO TAKE SHAPE AND DIG OFF THE SOCAL/BAJA PENINSULA COAST. THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...THE NEXT PACIFIC TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO MOVE ON-SHORE INTO CALIFORNIA THURSDAY. MOISTURE PROFILE AND JET SPEED/ORIENTATION WITH THIS NEXT SYSTEM APPEAR SIMILAR TO THE ONE EXITING THE AREA TODAY.

BREEZES DURING THE AFTERNOONS ALONG WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES 5-7 DEGREES BELOW AVERAGE. THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL PICK UP ON THURSDAY AHEAD OF THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE TROUGH. EXPECT INCREASED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND A CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION ON FRIDAY. LOW PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL CONTINUE INTO SATURDAY WITH BELOW AVERAGE TEMPERATURES. 
SOUTH-CENTRAL ARIZONA INCLUDING KPHX...KIWA...AND KSDL... DRY COOL FRONT HAS PASSED EAST OF THE TERMINALS AND GUSTY WEST WINDS SHOULD SLOWLY TAPER OFF AS THE EVENING PROGRESSES...RETURNING TO SOUTHEAST OR EAST BY 10Z OR SO. EXPECT WINDS TO AGAIN FAVOR THE SOUTHWEST TO WEST BY EARLY AFTERNOON TUESDAY. SKIES HAVE CLEARED AND THERE SHOULD BE LITTLE CLOUDINESS NEXT 24 HOURS...EXCEPT FOR A FEW LINGERING DECKS WITH BASES NEAR 10-12K FEET...AND MAYBE A FEW HIGH BASED CU DECKS AGAIN DURING THE AFTERNOON TUE. SOUTHEAST CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHWEST ARIZONA INCLUDING KIPL AND KBLH... GUSTY WESTERLY WINDS AT KIPL...AND SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS AT KBLH TONIGHT TO GRADUALLY DIMINISH OVERNIGHT AS SFC PRESSURE GRADIENTS WEAKEN.

WINDS TO FAVOR THE WEST AT KIPL NEXT 24 HOURS...AND FAVOR SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST AT KBLH WITH A PERIOD OF VARIABLE WINDS LATE TONIGHT THRU MID MORNING TUESDAY. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR AMENDED TAFS. 
THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY... A COUPLE OF MOSTLY DRY AND RELATIVELY COOL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. THIS WILL RESULT IN GUSTY AFTERNOON SOUTHWEST WINDS AREA-WIDE 15 TO 25 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 30 MPH BOTH THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. DRY WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WITH MUCH LIGHTER AFTERNOON WIND IS EXPECTED SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY. CONTINUED BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES. LITTLE CHANGE IN MINIMUM RH EACH DAY WITH VALUES RANGING FROM 15 TO 20 PERCENT. FAIR TO GOOD RECOVERY IS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT THROUGH THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
IMPULSES IS EXITING INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS LEAVING SEVERAL DEGREES OF COOLING BEHIND. HEIGHT AND THICKNESS VALUES WILL REBOUND WITH A STRONG WARMING TREND WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. THE NEXT IMPULSE DIGGING INTO THE BASE OF THE MEAN TROUGH POSITION OVER THE REGION WILL MOVE IN FROM THE WEST THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. NOT MUCH CHANCE OF PRECIP THIS FAR SOUTH...BUT STRONG GUSTY WINDS WILL RETURN BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON. 
COMING WEEKEND WITH SEVERAL WINDY PERIODS. LIGHTER WINDS AND COOLER TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TODAY AND WEDNESDAY HOWEVER DEWPOINTS WILL BE LOWER WITH SINGLE DIGIT MIN RHS BECOMING FAIRLY WIDESPREAD ACROSS LOWER ELEVATIONS OF ZONES 151 AND 152 BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. YET ANOTHER UPPER LOW WILL APPROACH CALIFORNIA LATER WEDNESDAY WITH AN ASSOCIATED UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE PASSING ACROSS THE AREA LATE THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY RESULTING IN STRONG GUSTY WINDS. IN COMBINATION WITH LOWER HUMIDITIES AND DRYING FUELS WE MAY SEE CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS BY FRIDAY AND PERHAPS AS EARLY AS THURSDAY AFTERNOON. 
DAYTIME TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES FOR TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL REBOUND WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY BEFORE DROPPING BACK DOWN TO BELOW NORMAL READINGS BY SATURDAY. OTHERWISE...PERIODS OF GUSTY WINDS CAN BE ANTICIPATED THIS WEEK AS WEATHER SYSTEMS PASS THROUGH THE REGION. 
OCCURRING ACROSS ERN PIMA ...GRAHAM AND GREENLEE COUNTIES THIS EVENING. EVENING RUNS OF THE HRRR INDICATE THAT THESE LIGHT SHOWERS/VIRGA WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE NNE AND MOSTLY OUT OF THE AREAS NE OF TUCSON BY MIDNIGHT. SHORT WAVE ROTATING THRU BROAD UPPER LEVEL TROFINESS OVER THE WRN CONUS WILL LIFT NE AWAY FROM THE AREA TONIGHT. DRY...COOLER AND NOT AS WINDY ON TUESDAY. WARMER WEDNESDAY WITH HIGHS SIMILAR TO TODAY THEN ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM WILL IMPACT THE AREA THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WITH STRONG GUSTY WINDS BOTH DAYS AND COOLER TEMPERATURES. ALL OF THIS WILL KEEP BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK. 
AFTER 19/08Z BECOMING CLEAR BY 19/10Z. A FEW CUMULUS CLOUDS OVER THE MOUNTAINS AGAIN AFTER 19/20Z. SW SFC WINDS GENERALLY LESS THAN 10 KTS OR LESS OVERNIGHT. SW WINDS REDEVELOPING TUESDAY AFTERNOON 10-15 KTS WITH GUSTS TO 25 KT. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR TAF AMENDMENTS. 
COMING WEEKEND WITH SEVERAL WINDY PERIODS. LIGHTER WINDS AND COOLER TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY HOWEVER DEWPOINTS WILL BE LOWER WITH SINGLE DIGIT MIN RHS BECOMING FAIRLY WIDESPREAD ACROSS LOWER ELEVATIONS OF ZONES 151 AND 152 BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. YET ANOTHER UPPER LOW WILL APPROACH CALIFORNIA LATER WEDNESDAY WITH AN ASSOCIATED UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE PASSING ACROSS THE AREA LATE THURSDAY RESULTING IN WINDS SIMILAR TO OR SLIGHTLY STRONGER THAN TODAY WITH LOWER HUMIDITY LEVELS FOR SPOTTY RED FLAG CONDITIONS SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF ZONES 151-152. THEN MODELS CURRENTLY INDICATE THE UPPER LOW WILL MOVE OVER NORTHERN ARIZONA FRIDAY FOR EVEN STRONGER WINDS. IF THIS COMES TO PASS WINDS WILL BE EVEN STRONGER FOR MORE WIDESPREAD CRITICAL CONDITIONS ESPECIALLY ZONE 152. BY THE END OF A WEEK OF LOW RH LEVELS AND BREEZINESS...FUELS WILL BE MORE RECEPTIVE AS 10 AND 100 HOUR FUELS SHOULD BECOME QUITE DRY WITH THE CURED GRASS READY TO GO ANY AFTERNOON. 
LOW PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY MOVE THROUGH THE AREA THIS EVENING...BRINGING ISOLATED SHOWERS TO THE MOUNTAINS NORTH AND EAST OF PHOENIX. FOLLOWING THE TROUGH...MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL PERSIST THROUGH LATE WEEK. ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL APPROACH THE REGION FROM CALIFORNIA LATE IN THE WEEK ALTHOUGH THE PRIMARY IMPACTS WILL BE COOLER TEMPERATURES AND INCREASED CLOUD COVER. 
DESERT SOUTHWEST THIS EVENING...AND THE LATEST PLOT DATA ALONG WITH VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWED THE MAIN VORT LOBE/TROF AXIS MOVING ACROSS SOUTH CENTRAL AZ AT 8 PM WITH MOST OF THE PVA AND UVV FOCUSED OVER SOUTHERN GILA COUNTY. RADAR INDICATED A FEW SHOWERS LINGERING OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN EAST OF PHOENIX...BUT LATEST MESOANALYSIS GRAPHICS SHOWED VIRTUALLY ZERO MLCAPE...SO IT APPEARS THUNDER IS PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING. STRONGER SUBSIDENCE BEHIND THE VORT TROF LED TO GENLY CLEAR SKIES FROM PHOENIX WESTWARD AS SEEN IN THE LATEST IR IMAGERY. FOR THE REST OF TONIGHT...EXPECT CLEARING SKIES BY MIDNIGHT ACROSS SRN GILA COUNTY...WITH MOSTLY CLEAR OR CLEAR SKIES AND DECREASING WINDS ELSEWHERE. FORECASTS LOOK TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE AND NO UPDATES ARE NEEDED. 
DRY COOL FRONT HAS PASSED EAST OF THE TERMINALS AND GUSTY WEST WINDS SHOULD SLOWLY TAPER OFF AS THE EVENING PROGRESSES...RETURNING TO SOUTHEAST OR EAST BY 10Z OR SO. EXPECT WINDS TO AGAIN FAVOR THE SOUTHWEST TO WEST BY EARLY AFTERNOON TUESDAY. SKIES HAVE CLEARED AND THERE SHOULD BE LITTLE CLOUDINESS NEXT 24 HOURS...EXCEPT FOR A FEW LINGERING DECKS WITH BASES NEAR 10-12K FEET...AND MAYBE A FEW HIGH BASED CU DECKS AGAIN DURING THE AFTERNOON TUE. SOUTHEAST CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHWEST ARIZONA INCLUDING KIPL AND KBLH... GUSTY WESTERLY WINDS AT KIPL...AND SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS AT KBLH TONIGHT TO GRADUALLY DIMINISH OVERNIGHT AS SFC PRESSURE GRADIENTS WEAKEN. A DRY AIRMASS TO KEEP SKIES MAINLY CLEAR THROUGH THE TAF PERIOD. WINDS TO FAVOR THE WEST AT KIPL NEXT 24 HOURS...AND FAVOR SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST AT KBLH WITH A PERIOD OF VARIABLE WINDS LATE TONIGHT THRU MID MORNING TUESDAY. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR AMENDED TAFS. 
THUNDERSTORMS NEAR THE UTAH BORDER THROUGH TUESDAY. OTHERWISE...EXPECT DRIER AND WARMER CONDITIONS TO RETURN THROUGH MIDWEEK. ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BRING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS BACK TO THE REGION FRIDAY...WITH LINGERING SHOWERS POSSIBLE SATURDAY THROUGH MEMORIAL DAY. 
OF THE TROUGH SLOWLY MOVING ACROSS SOUTHERN NEVADA. EXPECT MOST OF THE PRECIPITATION TO DISSIPATE OR MOVE OUT OF NORTHERN ARIZONA BY LATE TONIGHT. CURRENT FORECAST PRECIPITATION TRENDS MAY NEED TO BE TOUCHED UP TO DECREASE PRECIPITATION CHANCES LATER TONIGHT...BUT OTHERWISE THE FORECAST IS IN GOOD SHAPE WITH NO OTHER UPDATES PLANNED. 
EAST INTO WESTERN NEVADA THIS AFTERNOON. THIS FEATURE WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE DYNAMICALLY DRIVEN SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER NORTHERN ARIZONA THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE ALSO POSSIBLE THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS. THESE STORMS SHOULD REMAIN BELOW SEVERE LIMITS. PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL DIMINISH FROM WEST TO EAST TONIGHT AS THE UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVES INTO CENTRAL NEVADA. FOR TUESDAY...LINGERING MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL GENERATE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS NORTH OF THE GRAND CANYON AND HIGHWAY 160. FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...DRY CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST OVER NORTHERN ARIZONA WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES CONTINUING. BY FRIDAY...THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS CONTINUE TO PROG AN UPPER LEVEL LOW TO LIFT INTO NORTHWESTERN ARIZONA. RIGHT NOW IT APPEARS THE BEST PRECIP CHANCES WILL BE CONFINED TO AREAS WEST OF I-17 AND HIGHWAY 89. AS THE LOW LIFTS ACROSS NORTHERN ARIZONA FRIDAY NIGHT...RAIN SHOWER CHANCES WILL CONTINUE ALONG WITH A CHANCE OF HIGH ELEVATION SNOW SHOWERS. FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MEMORIAL DAY...LINGERING MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE LOW WILL GENERATE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS EACH DAY. 
THE FAR EAST AND NORTHEAST PORTIONS OF ARIZONA THROUGH 12Z...WITH BRIEF MVFR CIG/VSBYS NEAR THE SHOWERS. OTHERWISE...VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FROM 12Z TUESDAY THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE TAF PERIOD. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR TAF AMENDMENTS. 
LOCATIONS NEAR AND NORTH OF THE MOGOLLON RIM OVERNIGHT. TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY WILL SEE LIGHT SOUTHWEST BREEZES DURING THE AFTERNOONS ALONG WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES 5-7 DEGREES BELOW AVERAGE. THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...SW WINDS WILL PICK UP ON THURSDAY AHEAD OF THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE TROUGH. EXPECT INCREASED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND A CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION ON FRIDAY. LOW PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL CONTINUE INTO SATURDAY WITH BELOW AVERAGE TEMPERATURES. 
THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY. BY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...DRIER AND WARMER CONDITIONS WILL RETURN. ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BRING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS BACK TO THE REGION FRIDAY. RELATIVELY LOWER PRECIPITATION CHANCES ARE FORECAST SATURDAY THROUGH MEMORIAL DAY. 
NEVADA THIS AFTERNOON. THIS FEATURE WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE DYNAMICALLY DRIVEN SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER NORTHERN ARIZONA THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE ALSO POSSIBLE THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS. THESE STORMS SHOULD REMAIN BELOW SEVERE LIMITS. PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL DIMINISH FROM WEST TO EAST TONIGHT AS THE UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVES INTO CENTRAL NEVADA. FOR TUESDAY...LINGERING MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL GENERATE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS NORTH OF THE GRAND CANYON AND HIGHWAY 160. FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...DRY CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST OVER NORTHERN ARIZONA WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES CONTINUING. BY FRIDAY...THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS CONTINUE TO PROG AN UPPER LEVEL LOW TO LIFT INTO NORTHWESTERN ARIZONA. RIGHT NOW IT APPEARS THE BEST PRECIP CHANCES WILL BE CONFINED TO AREAS WEST OF I-17 AND HIGHWAY 89. AS THE LOW LIFTS ACROSS NORTHERN ARIZONA FRIDAY NIGHT...RAIN SHOWER CHANCES WILL CONTINUE ALONG WITH A CHANCE OF HIGH ELEVATION SNOW SHOWERS. FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MEMORIAL DAY...LINGERING MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE LOW WILL GENERATE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS EACH DAY. 
WILL CONTINUE THIS EVENING...MAINLY ALONG AND NORTH OF THE MOGOLLON RIM. AFTER 03- 04Z...EXPECT SHOWER ACTIVITY TO BE MAINLY IN FAR NORTHEAST ARIZONA. BRIEF MVFR CIG/VSBY MAY OCCUR NEAR SHOWERS. VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FROM 12Z TUESDAY THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE TAF PERIOD. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR TAF AMENDMENTS. 
SOUTHEAST ARIZONA AS A WEATHER SYSTEM WAS MOVING INTO THE GREAT BASIN REGION. MOISTURE THIS FAR SOUTH WILL BE LIMITED...SO THE BEST CHANCE FOR SHOWERS WILL BE CONFINED TO NORTHERN ARIZONA INTO THE WHITE MOUNTAINS THIS EVENING AND TONIGHT. THE AREA WILL BE IN BETWEEN SYSTEMS WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY BEFORE YET ANOTHER ONE ENTERS THE DESERT SOUTHWEST ON FRIDAY. MEDIUM RANGE MODELS SUGGESTED THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL BE DRY FOR MOST OF SOUTHEAST ARIZONA. THUS...WILL KEEP LOW POP VALUES GOING FOR AREAS WELL NORTH OF TUCSON. STRONG AND GUSTY WINDS WILL BE A SURE THING ON THURSDAY AS THE SYSTEM APPROACHES AND AGAIN ON FRIDAY. 
AFTER 19/02Z BECOMING CLEAR BY 19/08Z.  A FEW CUMULUS CLOUDS OVER THE MOUNTAINS AGAIN AFTER 19/20Z.  GUSTY SW SFC WINDS 15-25 KTS WITH GUSTS TO 35 KTS THRU 19/02Z THEN QUICKLY EASING TO 10 KTS OR LESS. SW WINDS REDEVELOPING TUESDAY AFTERNOON 10-15 KTS WITH GUSTS TO 25 KT.  AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR TAF AMENDMENTS.  CERNIGLIA 
COMING WEEKEND WITH SEVERAL WINDY PERIODS.  THIS AFTERNOON WINDS HAVE PICKED UP AS A TROUGH APPROACHES AND OCCASIONALLY TOUCHING RED FLAG CRITERIA HOWEVER THEY ARE VERY SPORADIC AS EXPECTED.  THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE THIS AFTERNOON THEN THE WINDS WILL DIE OFF QUICKLY THIS EVENING.  LIGHTER WINDS AND COOLER TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY HOWEVER DEWPOINTS WILL BE LOWER WITH SINGLE DIGIT MIN RHS BECOMING FAIRLY WIDESPREAD ACROSS LOWER ELEVATIONS OF ZONES 151 AND 152 BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. YET ANOTHER UPPER LOW WILL APPROACH CALIFORNIA LATER WEDNESDAY WITH AN ASSOCIATED UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE PASSING ACROSS THE AREA LATE THURSDAY RESULTING IN WINDS SIMILAR TO OR SLIGHTLY STRONGER THAN TODAY WITH LOWER HUMIDITY LEVELS FOR SPOTTY RED FLAG CONDITIONS SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF ZONES 151-152.  THEN MODELS CURRENTLY INDICATE THE UPPER LOW WILL MOVE OVER NORTHERN ARIZONA FRIDAY FOR EVEN STRONGER WINDS.  IF THIS COMES TO PASS WINDS WILL BE EVEN STRONGER FOR MORE WIDESPREAD CRITICAL CONDITIONS ESPECIALLY ZONE 152.  BY THE END OF A WEEK OF LOW RH LEVELS AND BREEZINESS...FUELS WILL BE MORE RECEPTIVE AS 10 AND 100 HOUR FUELS SHOULD BECOME QUITE DRY WITH THE CURED GRASS READY TO GO ANY AFTERNOON.  CERNIGLIA 
LOW PRESSURE CONTINUES ITS SLOW EASTWARD PROGRESSION THIS AFTERNOON AND IS CENTERED OVER WESTERN NEVADA AS OF 19Z. THE BAND OF CLOUDS AND SPRINKLES THAT MOVED THROUGH THE AREA THIS MORNING HAS SHIFTED INTO NORTHERN ARIZONA ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME SHOWERS BEGINNING TO SHOW UP OVER PORTIONS OF GILA COUNTY. MEANWHILE THE DESERTS REMAIN DRY WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S. HI-RES GUIDANCE REMAINS FIRM IN THEIR SOLUTIONS OF A DRY EVENING ACROSS THE DESERTS WITH VERY ISOLATED SHOWERS NORTH/EAST OF PHOENIX. SREF HOLDING TOUGH WITH 30-40 POPS ACROSS GILA COUNTY THIS EVENING. ELECTED TO TRIM POPS BELOW 10 PERCENT AROUND THE PHOENIX AREA AND INTO THE 10-20 PERCENT RANGE AROUND GLOBE. MLCAPES ONLY TOP OUT AROUND 100 J/KG ACROSS GILA COUNTY THIS AFTERNOON SO I OPTED TO MAINTAIN THE SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER. FORECAST FOR MID WEEK APPEARS RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD WITH HIGH CONFIDENCE AND GOOD AGREEMENT AMONG ENSEMBLE MEMBERS. A PERSISTENT SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL BRING VARYING AMOUNTS OF HIGH CLOUDS THROUGH THURSDAY...AND WILL ALSO PREVENT STRONG RIDGING FROM PARKING OVER THE DESERT SOUTHWEST AS WOULD TYPICALLY BE THE CASE THIS TIME OF YEAR. WHILE WARMER THAN WHAT WAS SEEN THIS WEEKEND...TEMPS THROUGH THURSDAY WILL STILL BE BELOW NORMAL FOR MID MAY AND WILL ONLY REACH THE UPPER 80S/LOWER 90S EACH AFTERNOON. MEDIUM RANGE DETERMINISTIC AND ENSEMBLE FORECASTS CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE A FAIRLY ACTIVE SOUTHERN STORM TRACK...WITH WEAK RIDGING OVER THE NE PACIFIC/NORTH AMERICAN WEST COAST AND AN ACTIVE 300MB JET UNDERCUTTING AND SPINNING OFF ADDITIONAL STORM SYSTEMS NORTH OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. BY THE LATE WEEK PERIOD...YET ANOTHER PACIFIC LOW WILL TRANSITION OFF THE PACIFIC AND INTO THE SOUTHWEST. THE MOISTURE PROFILE WITH SYSTEM IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF TODAY`S AT THIS TIME...WITH ELEVATED MOISTURE/RH FIELDS THROUGH PORTIONS OF THE MID- LEVELS AND SOMEWHAT DRY SUB-CLOUD LAYERS. ANOTHER COOL DOWN WILL RESULT FRIDAY INTO THE EARLY WEEKEND...KNOCKING TEMPERATURES DOWN INTO THE 80S AND A POTENTIAL 10 DEGREES BELOW LATE MAY NORMALS. LATE WEEKEND CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO BE ON THE DRIER SIDE IN THE WAKE OF THE NEXT SYSTEM WITH ENOUGH WARMING TO INTRODUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF HEADING BACK INTO THE 90S BY THE MEMORIAL DAY HOLIDAY. 
SOUTH-CENTRAL ARIZONA INCLUDING KPHX...KIWA...AND KSDL... A DRY COLD FRONT...THAT HAS NOW MOVED TO THE EAST OF THE PHX AREA...WILL CONTINUE TO BRING GUSTY WESTERLY WINDS TO THE PHX AREA TERMINALS THROUGH THE REST OF THE EVENING....WITH WINDS DIMINISHING OVERNIGHT AND BECOMING EASTERLY TOWARDS MORNING. WEAKER SFC PRESSURE GRADIENTS ON TUESDAY WILL KEEP WINDS LIGHTER...WITH THE TYPICAL WESTERLY AFTERNOON BREEZES MAINLY REMAINING AOB 10 KTS. SCT MID TO HIGH CLOUD DECKS THIS EVENING TO GIVE WAY TO MAINLY CLEAR SKIES LATER TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. SOUTHEAST CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHWEST ARIZONA INCLUDING KIPL AND KBLH... GUSTY WESTERLY WINDS AT KIPL...AND SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS AT KBLH TONIGHT TO GRADUALLY DIMINISH EARLY TUESDAY AS SFC PRESSURE GRADIENTS WEAKEN. A DRY AIRMASS TO KEEP SKIES MAINLY CLEAR THROUGH THE TAF PERIOD. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR AMENDED TAFS. 
NEW WEEK BEFORE WE SEE TEMPERATURES FALL BACK A FEW DEGREES TUESDAY. EXPECT PERIODS OF GUSTY WINDS THIS WEEK...INCLUDING TODAY...DUE TO SEVERAL MORE PASSING WEATHER SYSTEMS. 
STRONG AND GUSTY WINDS IN ADVANCE OF IT. MODELS TRACK THE SYSTEM WELL NORTH OF THE AREA SO THE BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS WILL BE ACROSS NORTHERN ARIZONA INTO THE WHITE MOUNTAINS. DRY ACROSS MOST OF SOUTHEAST ARIZONA. CURRENT FORECAST APPEARED TO HANDLE THINGS WELL...SO NO UPDATES NECESSARY THIS MORNING. PLEASE REFER TO THE ADDITIONAL SECTIONS FOR MORE DETAILS. 
FAIR WEATHER CUMULUS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE DAY AT AROUND 10K FT. A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAY BE POSSIBLE MAINLY IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS NE OF KSAD. LIGHT OVERNIGHT WINDS WILL GIVE WAY TO GUSTY SW WINDS TODAY AFTER 18/16Z. WINDS TODAY WILL RANGE FROM 15 TO 25 KTS GUSTING UP TO 30 TO 35 KTS...STRONGEST IN THE AFTERNOON. WINDS WILL DIMINISH QUICKLY AFTER SUNSET...KEEPING A BIT MORE OF A SOUTHERLY COMPONENT OVERNIGHT. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR TAF AMENDMENTS. 
SYSTEM MOVING INTO THE AREA. THE BULK OF THE STORM WILL REMAIN TO OUR NORTH BUT A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CAN`T BE RULED OUT FOR THE WHITE MOUNTAINS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THE MAIN IMPACT WILL BE WITH ANOTHER ROUND OF GUSTY WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY LEADING TO BORDERLINE RED FLAG THRESHOLDS THIS AFTERNOON. GIVEN THE MARGINAL CONDITIONS AND HIGHER OVERALL FUEL MOISTURES NO FIRE WEATHER HEADLINE WILL BE ISSUED AT THIS TIME. THEREAFTER...COOLER TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TUESDAY WITH SOMEWHAT LIGHTER WINDS. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN BELOW SEASONAL AVERAGES FOR MOST OF THE PERIOD. ANOTHER SYSTEM COULD BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF GUSTY WINDS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...BUT CURRENTLY IT IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW CRITICAL RED FLAG THRESHOLDS. 
WARMING TREND IS NOW EAST OF THE AREA...HOWEVER WE WILL STILL MANAGE TO SQUEEZE OUT ANOTHER FEW DEGREES OF WARMING WORKING DOWN THE TEMPERATURE COLUMN FOR VALLEY LOCATIONS TODAY. WE`RE STARTING TO SEE ANOTHER INCREASE IN SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AHEAD OF YET ANOTHER UNSEASONABLE LOW LATITUDE WEATHER SYSTEM. A LOW IS BRIEFLY CONSOLIDATING NEAR CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AS ENERGY CARVES INTO THE BACK SIDE OF THE PERSISTENT LARGE SCALE MEAN TROUGH POSITION OVER THE REGION. IT LOOKS LIKE MORE OF A GLANCING BLOW FOR OUR AREA THAN THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM...SO MUCH LESS CHANCE OF RAIN FOR MOST OF OUR AREA AND OVERALL THE WINDS WON`T BE QUITE AS STRONG. THE CYCLE CONTINUES MID WEEK WITH ANOTHER WARMING TREND FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER GLANCING BLOW FROM A SYSTEM PASSING JUST NORTH OF US FRIDAY. THAT WILL MEAN ANOTHER ROUND OF GUSTY WINDS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. 
AND CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO THE AREA TODAY AND TUESDAY. BY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...DRIER AND WARMER CONDITIONS WILL RETURN. ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BRING SHOWERS BACK TO THE REGION FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. 
GENERATING DYNAMICALLY DRIVEN SHOWERS OVER YAVAPAI AND WESTERN COCONINO COUNTIES THIS MORNING. THIS ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO TRANSLATE EAST TODAY AS THE LOW PIVOTS INTO WESTERN NEVADA. UPDATED THE FORECAST TO SHOW THIS TREND. THE SHORT RANGE MODELS PROG 0-6 KM BULK SHEAR GREATER THAN 35 KNOTS TO DEVELOP EAST OF I-17 AND HIGHWAY 89 THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...THE BEST INSTABILITY IS FORECAST TO REMAIN WEST OF I-17/HIGHWAY 89. IF ANY STORM BECOMES ROOTED IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER AND ADVECTS EAST OF I-17...THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR IT TO BECOME ORGANIZED AND POSSIBLY STRONG TO SEVERE. FOR NOW KEEP WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AFTERNOON CONVECTION AND KEEP MENTION OF SEVERE OUT OF THE ZONES. THE REMAINING WEATHER ELEMENTS ARE IN GOOD SHAPE. ONLY MADE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNT FOR CURRENT OBS/TRENDS. THE UPDATED FORECAST HAS BEEN SENT. 
CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WILL BRING GUSTY SOUTHWEST WINDS TO THE AREA TODAY...ALONG WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THIS LOW CENTER IS TAKING A TRAJECTORY THROUGH NORTHERN ARIZONA...WHICH WILL LIMIT SHOWER ACTIVITY SOUTH OF THE I-40 CORRIDOR. THE BEST CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THE HIGHEST INSTABILITY WILL BE NEAR THE UTAH BORDER. THIS SYSTEM EJECTS TUESDAY...WITH A LINGERING CHANCE OF INSTABILITY SHOWERS ALONG THE UTAH BIRDER. DRIER AND WARMER CONDITIONS WILL ARRIVE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...WITH ANOTHER LOW DUE LATER IN THE WEEK AND INTO THE EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEKEND. THIS NEXT LOW MAY BE A BIT COLDER AND WILL TAKE A PATH FARTHER SOUTH. THIS COULD RESULT IN BETTER CHANCES FOR RAINFALL FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...BUT IT IS A BIT TOO EARLY TO TELL. 
THROUGH THIS EVENING WITH THE GREATEST COVERAGE ALONG AND NORTH OF THE MOGOLLON RIM. TAF SITES KGCN AND KPGA HAVE THE GREATEST CHANCE OF OBSERVING MVFR/IFR CIG/VSBY. SHOWERS WILL LIKELY CONTINUE IN FAR NORTHEAST ARIZONA THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR TAF AMENDMENTS. 
GUSTY SOUTHERLY/SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS ACROSS NORTHERN ARIZONA TODAY. THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON...MAINLY ALONG AND NORTH OF THE MOGOLLON RIM.  A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE ON TUESDAY WITH SLIGHTLY LESS WIND. WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...EXPECT DRIER CONDITIONS WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS RETURNS FRIDAY. EXPECT BREEZY SOUTHWEST WINDS EACH DAY WITH DAYTIME TEMPERATURES RUNNING A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. 
LOW PRESSURE OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST WILL MOVE INLAND TODAY...BRINGING INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS TO THE MOUNTAINS NORTH OF PHOENIX. SUNNY SKIES AND DRY WEATHER WILL RETURN TUESDAY WITH TEMPERATURES STILL SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL. YET ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL APPROACH THE REGION FROM CALIFORNIA LATE IN THE WEEK ALTHOUGH THE PRIMARY IMPACTS WILL BE COOLER TEMPERATURES AND INCREASED CLOUD COVER. 
MID MORNING WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A LARGE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER CENTRAL CALIFORNIA...WITH A LEADING SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING THROUGH WESTERN ARIZONA AS OF 16Z. VIS IMAGERY AND REGIONAL RADAR MOSAIC SUGGESTS SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS ACROSS NORTHERN LA PAZ AND NORTHWEST MARICOPA COUNTIES BUT LITTLE IN THE WAY OF MEASURABLE PRECIP HAS FALLEN AT THIS POINT...MORE THAN LIKELY A FEW SPRINKLES AT MOST. FORECAST FOR THE REST OF THE DAY REQUIRES ONLY A FEW MINOR ADJUSTMENTS...MAINLY BASED ON OBSERVATIONAL TRENDS THROUGH 16Z. TEMPS STILL LOOK ON TRACK TO TOP OUT AROUND THE 90 DEGREE MARK...WHICH WOULD PHOENIX`S FIRST 90 DEGREE DAY IN NEARLY A WEEK /MAY 13/. AS FOR PRECIP CHANCES...HRRR KEEPS ALL PRECIP CONFINED TO NORTHERN ARIZONA TODAY BUT UAWRFS...HIRESW WRF MODELS...AND GFS ALL INDICATE A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS NORTH/EAST OF PHOENIX. DO NOT WANT TO ENTIRELY REMOVE POPS GIVEN STRONG 250MB JET SUPPORT AND MODEST MERIDIONAL COMPONENT OF THE LOW LEVEL PRE-TROUGH WINDS. I WILL LEAVE 10-30 POPS IN PLACE FROM WICKENBURG TO SUNFLOWER TO GLOBE...ANY RAINFALL AMOUNTS THAT OCCUR WILL BE LIGHT. 
LOWER TROUGH HEIGHTS MOVING THROUGH THE WESTERN FORECAST AREA DURING PEAK HEATING WILL KEEP LOCALES LIKE YUMA AND EL CENTRO SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN THEIR CITY COUNTERPARTS TO THE EAST. TEMPERATURES OUT ACROSS SOUTHEAST CA TO PEAK IN THE LOW TO MID 80S...WHILE WE`LL BE IN THE UPPER 80S TO FLIRTING WITH THE 90 DEGREE MARK ACROSS SOUTH- CENTRAL AZ. THE AFOREMENTIONED UPPER JET AND DIFLUENT FLOW SET-UP WILL ALSO SUPPORT ELEVATED BREEZES DURING THE DAY PARTICULARLY MARICOPA COUNTY EASTWARD...WITH GUSTS 20 TO 30 MPH POSSIBLE. DEEPER MIXING COURTESY OF THE WINDY CONDITIONS WILL ALSO HELP NUDGE TEMPERATURES UPWARD FOR PHOENIX...COOLIDGE AND GILA BEND. TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...THE UPPER LOW WILL BEGIN TO CLEAR EAST OF THE AREA AS WEAK RIDGING AND BROAD SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT TRANSITION INTO THE FOUR CORNERS. 500MB HEIGHTS GRADUALLY RISE TO VALUES CLOSER TO MID-MAY NORMALS AND SFC TEMPERATURES RESPOND IN KIND...HEADING BACK INTO THE 90S FOR MIDWEEK. DESPITE THE SUBTLE INCREASE IN ML THICKNESSES...STILL LOOKS LIKE IT WON`T BE ENOUGH TO PEAK OUR TEMPERATURES ABOVE NORMAL VALUES...WHICH ARE IN THE MID TO UPPER 90S FOR PHOENIX AND YUMA RESPECTIVELY. MEDIUM RANGE DETERMINISTIC AND ENSEMBLE FORECASTS CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE A FAIRLY ACTIVE SOUTHERN STORM TRACK...WITH WEAK RIDGING OVER THE NE PACIFIC/NORTH AMERICAN WEST COAST AND AN ACTIVE 300MB JET UNDERCUTTING AND SPINNING OFF ADDITIONAL STORM SYSTEMS NORTH OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. BY THE LATE WEEK PERIOD...YET ANOTHER PACIFIC LOW WILL TRANSITION OFF THE PACIFIC AND INTO THE SOUTHWEST. THE MOISTURE PROFILE WITH SYSTEM IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF TODAY`S AT THIS TIME...WITH ELEVATED MOISTURE/RH FIELDS THROUGH PORTIONS OF THE MID- LEVELS AND SOMEWHAT DRY SUB-CLOUD LAYERS. ANOTHER COOL DOWN WILL RESULT FRIDAY INTO THE EARLY WEEKEND...KNOCKING TEMPERATURES DOWN INTO THE 80S AND A POTENTIAL 10 DEGREES BELOW LATE MAY NORMALS. LATE WEEKEND CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO BE ON THE DRIER SIDE IN THE WAKE OF THE NEXT SYSTEM WITH ENOUGH WARMING TO INTRODUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF HEADING BACK INTO THE 90S BY THE MEMORIAL DAY HOLIDAY. 
SOUTH-CENTRAL ARIZONA INCLUDING KPHX...KIWA...AND KSDL... SOUTHEAST CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHWEST ARIZONA INCLUDING KIPL AND KBLH... A MOSTLY DRY COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REGION TODAY RESULTING IN STRONG GUSTY SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WINDS AREA-WIDE. THROUGH 17Z MON...MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. SOUTH WIND 5 TO 10 KNOTS. FROM 17Z MON THROUGH 03Z TUE...MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. INCREASING AFTERNOON SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WIND 15 TO 25 KNOTS WITH GUSTS TO 30 KNOTS. PEAK WIND NEAR 23Z MON. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR AMENDED TAFS. 
THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY... A COUPLE OF MOSTLY DRY AND RELATIVELY COOL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. THIS WILL RESULT IN GUSTY AFTERNOON SOUTHWEST WINDS AREA-WIDE 15 TO 25 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 30 MPH BOTH THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. DRY WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WITH MUCH LIGHTER AFTERNOON WIND IS EXPECTED SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY. CONTINUED BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES. LITTLE CHANGE IN MINIMUM RH EACH DAY WITH VALUES RANGING FROM 15 TO 20 PERCENT. FAIR TO POOR RECOVERY IS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT DUE TO SOME BREEZINESS WITH THE PASSING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS. 
WILL BRING GUSTY SOUTHWEST WINDS TO THE AREA TODAY...ALONG WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THIS LOW CENTER IS TAKING A TRAJECTORY THROUGH NORTHERN ARIZONA...WHICH WILL LIMIT SHOWER ACTIVITY SOUTH OF THE I-40 CORRIDOR. THE BEST CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THE HIGHEST INSTABILITY WILL BE NEAR THE UTAH BORDER. THIS SYSTEM EJECTS TUESDAY...WITH A LINGERING CHANCE OF INSTABILITY SHOWERS ALONG THE UTAH BIRDER. DRIER AND WARMER CONDITIONS WILL ARRIVE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...WITH ANOTHER LOW DUE LATER IN THE WEEK AND INTO THE EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEKEND. THIS NEXT LOW MAY BE A BIT COLDER AND WILL TAKE A PATH FARTHER SOUTH. THIS COULD RESULT IN BETTER CHANCES FOR RAINFALL FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...BUT IT IS A BIT TOO EARLY TO TELL. 
TO DEVELOP AFTER 18Z...WITH THE GREATEST COVERAGE ALONG THE NORTH OF THE MOGOLLON RIM. MVFR/IFR VISIBILITY IS POSSIBLE UNDER THE HEAVIER SHOWERS, WITH STRONG, ERRATIC SURFACE WINDS POSSIBLE IN THE VICINITY OF STORMS. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR TAF AMENDMENTS. 
GUSTY SOUTH TO SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS ACROSS NORTHERN ARIZONA TODAY. THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BY THIS AFTERNOON...MAINLY ALONG AND NORTH OF THE MOGOLLON RIM. A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE ON TUESDAY WITH SLIGHTLY LESS WIND. WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...EXPECT DRIER CONDITIONS WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS RETURNS FRIDAY. EXPECT BREEZY SOUTHWEST WINDS EACH DAY WITH DAYTIME TEMPERATURES RUNNING A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. 
THE NEXT IN THE SERIES OF PACIFIC STORMS CURRENTLY EXPANDS OFF THE NORTHERN CA COAST INTO THE NORTHEAST PACIFIC...WITH THE CIRC CENTER OVER THE BAY AREA THIS EARLY AM. BROADLY DIFLUENT FLOW AROUND THE BASE OF THE SYSTEM ALREADY WORKING INTO THE FORECAST AREA PER 00Z RAOBS AND OVERNIGHT IR SATELLITE TRENDS. 00Z RAOB PWATS AND BLENDED TPW INDICATE 0.5 TO 0.75 INCH VALUES SPANNING THE AREA...IN LINE WITH EARLIER FORECASTS AND OVERNIGHT/EARLY AM MODEL FCSTS. UPPER LOW WILL DIP SOUTHWESTWARD THROUGH THE DAY BEFORE TRACKING INTO THE GREAT BASIN...SWEEPING UPPER 560 TO MID 570DM 500MB HEIGHTS OVER SOUTHEAST CA BY MIDDAY AND INTO SOUTH-CENTRAL AZ THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. NEAR 100KT SWSTRLY JET STREAK WILL ALSO NOSE INTO AZ BY MIDDAY. WHILE THIS SYSTEM IS NOT AS MOISTURE RICH AS FRIDAY`S...FAVORABLE OROGRAPHIC ORIENTATION AND DYNAMICS SUPPORT AT LEAST SLIGHT CHANCES FOR SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN LOCALES OF THE FORECAST AREA...THE AREAS NORTH AND EAST OF PHOENIX AS WELL AS JOSHUA TREE NP. VERY SLIGHT CHANCES EXTEND INTO PORTIONS OF THE SOUTH-CENTRAL AZ DESERTS...INCLUDING PHOENIX AND GILA BEND...TO ACCOUNT FOR JET ENTRANCE DYNAMICS BUT NOT EXPECTING MUCH BY WAY OF QPF VALUES. FCST CROSS SECTIONS KEEP THE MOISTURE IN NARROW LAYER BETWEEN 600-500MB. THIS WILL RESULT IN THICKER MID-LEVEL CLOUD DECKS...PLENTY OF VIRGA AND TRACE PRECIP AMOUNTS FOR SOME THIS AFTERNOON OVER THE LOWER AZ DESERTS. LOWER TROUGH HEIGHTS MOVING THROUGH THE WESTERN FORECAST AREA DURING PEAK HEATING WILL KEEP LOCALES LIKE YUMA AND EL CENTRO SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN THEIR CITY COUNTERPARTS TO THE EAST. TEMPERATURES OUT ACROSS SOUTHEAST CA TO PEAK IN THE LOW TO MID 80S...WHILE WE`LL BE IN THE UPPER 80S TO FLIRTING WITH THE 90 DEGREE MARK ACROSS SOUTH- CENTRAL AZ. THE AFOREMENTIONED UPPER JET AND DIFLUENT FLOW SET-UP WILL ALSO SUPPORT ELEVATED BREEZES DURING THE DAY PARTICULARLY MARICOPA COUNTY EASTWARD...WITH GUSTS 20 TO 30 MPH POSSIBLE. DEEPER MIXING COURTESY OF THE WINDY CONDITIONS WILL ALSO HELP NUDGE TEMPERATURES UPWARD FOR PHOENIX...COOLIDGE AND GILA BEND. TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...THE UPPER LOW WILL BEGIN TO CLEAR EAST OF THE AREA AS WEAK RIDGING AND BROAD SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT TRANSITION INTO THE FOUR CORNERS. 500MB HEIGHTS GRADUALLY RISE TO VALUES CLOSER TO MID-MAY NORMALS AND SFC TEMPERATURES RESPOND IN KIND...HEADING BACK INTO THE 90S FOR MIDWEEK. DESPITE THE SUBTLE INCREASE IN ML THICKNESSES...STILL LOOKS LIKE IT WON`T BE ENOUGH TO PEAK OUR TEMPERATURES ABOVE NORMAL VALUES...WHICH ARE IN THE MID TO UPPER 90S FOR PHOENIX AND YUMA RESPECTIVELY. MEDIUM RANGE DETERMINISTIC AND ENSEMBLE FORECASTS CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE A FAIRLY ACTIVE SOUTHERN STORM TRACK...WITH WEAK RIDGING OVER THE NE PACIFIC/NORTH AMERICAN WEST COAST AND AN ACTIVE 300MB JET UNDERCUTTING AND SPINNING OFF ADDITIONAL STORM SYSTEMS NORTH OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. BY THE LATE WEEK PERIOD...YET ANOTHER PACIFIC LOW WILL TRANSITION OFF THE PACIFIC AND INTO THE SOUTHWEST. THE MOISTURE PROFILE WITH SYSTEM IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF TODAY`S AT THIS TIME...WITH ELEVATED MOISTURE/RH FIELDS THROUGH PORTIONS OF THE MID- LEVELS AND SOMEWHAT DRY SUB-CLOUD LAYERS. ANOTHER COOL DOWN WILL RESULT FRIDAY INTO THE EARLY WEEKEND...KNOCKING TEMPERATURES DOWN INTO THE 80S AND A POTENTIAL 10 DEGREES BELOW LATE MAY NORMALS. LATE WEEKEND CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO BE ON THE DRIER SIDE IN THE WAKE OF THE NEXT SYSTEM WITH ENOUGH WARMING TO INTRODUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF HEADING BACK INTO THE 90S BY THE MEMORIAL DAY HOLIDAY. 
THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY...A COUPLE OF MOSTLY DRY AND RELATIVELY COOL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. THIS WILL RESULT IN GUSTY AFTERNOON SOUTHWEST WINDS AREA-WIDE 15 TO 25 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 30 MPH BOTH THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. DRY WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WITH MUCH LIGHTER AFTERNOON WIND IS EXPECTED SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY. CONTINUED BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES. LITTLE CHANGE IN MINIMUM RH EACH DAY WITH VALUES RANGING FROM 15 TO 20 PERCENT. FAIR TO POOR RECOVERY IS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT DUE TO SOME BREEZINESS WITH THE PASSING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS. 
SOUTH-CENTRAL ARIZONA INCLUDING KPHX...KIWA...AND KSDL... SOUTHEAST CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHWEST ARIZONA INCLUDING KIPL AND KBLH... MAIN AVIATION WEATHER IMPACT WILL BE AN INCREASE IN WIND AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. LIGHT AND DIURNAL WINDS ARE EXPECTED THROUGH MONDAY MORNING. THEREAFTER...WESTERLY FLOW WILL INCREASE WITH GUSTS AS HIGH AS 25 TO 30 KT AT ALL TAF SITES. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE ALSO EXPECTED MONDAY AFTERNOON...BUT WILL REMAIN CONFINED TO THE AREAS WELL NORTH AND EAST OF PHOENIX. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR AMENDED TAFS. 
WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY... LARGE-SCALE LOW PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN US TO KEEP TEMPERATURE BELOW NORMAL AND HUMIDITY LEVELS SOMEWHAT ELEVATED THROUGH THE PERIOD...WITH MINIMUM HUMIDITIES ONLY FALLING INTO THE 15-25 PERCENT RANGE EACH DAY...WITH GOOD TO EXCELLENT OVERNIGHT RECOVERIES. WINDS WILL BE MAINLY LIGHT DIURNALLY DRIVEN...WITH OCCASIONAL AFTERNOON GUSTINESS FROM TUESDAY INTO THURSDAY. A STRONGER PACIFIC LOW CENTER MOVING INTO THE REGION WILL BRING STRONGER WINDS...AND EVEN A CHANCE FOR A FEW SHOWERS OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF SOUTH-CENTRAL AZ ON FRIDAY...WITH LIGHTER WINDS RETURNING FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AS THE AFOREMENTIONED LOW CENTER MOVES OFF TO THE EAST. 
TREND IS NOW EAST OF THE AREA...HOWEVER WE WILL STILL MANAGE TO SQUEEZE OUT ANOTHER FEW DEGREES OF WARMING WORKING DOWN THE TEMPERATURE COLUMN FOR VALLEY LOCATIONS TODAY. WE`RE STARTING TO SEE ANOTHER INCREASE IN SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AHEAD OF YET ANOTHER UNSEASONABLE LOW LATITUDE WEATHER SYSTEM. A LOW IS BRIEFLY CONSOLIDATING NEAR CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AS ENERGY CARVES INTO THE BACK SIDE OF THE PERSISTENT LARGE SCALE MEAN TROUGH POSITION OVER THE REGION. IT LOOKS LIKE MORE OF A GLANCING BLOW FOR OUR AREA THAN THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM...SO MUCH LESS CHANCE OF RAIN FOR MOST OF OUR AREA AND OVERALL THE WINDS WON`T BE QUITE AS STRONG. THE CYCLE CONTINUES MID WEEK WITH ANOTHER WARMING TREND FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER GLANCING BLOW FROM A SYSTEM PASSING JUST NORTH OF US FRIDAY. THAT WILL MEAN ANOTHER ROUND OF GUSTY WINDS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. 
LOW PRESSURE OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST WILL MOVE INLAND ON MONDAY...BRINGING INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS TO THE MOUNTAINS NORTH OF PHOENIX. SUNNY SKIES AND DRY WEATHER WILL RETURN ON TUESDAY BUT TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL. YET ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL APPROACH THE REGION FROM CALIFORNIA LATE IN THE WEEK ALTHOUGH THE PRIMARY IMPACTS WILL BE COOLER TEMPERATURES AND INCREASED CLOUD COVER. 
CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS PREVAIL ACROSS THE DESERT SOUTHWEST THIS EVENING. LATEST 00Z TUCSON SOUNDING SHOWS SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AHEAD OF A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OFF THE WEST COAST WITH ALL MOISTURE PARAMETERS WITHIN THE CLIMO LOWER AND UPPER QUARTILES. FORECAST REMAINS ON TRACK. ONLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SHORT-TERM TEMPERATURES AND DEWPOINTS WERE NEEDED THIS EVENING. 
WEAK SHORTWAVE RIDGING IS EVIDENT ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY THIS AFTERNOON...AS THE REGION SITS BETWEEN TWO UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS. THE STORM SYSTEM THAT BROUGHT COOL TEMPERATURES AND RECORD RAINFALL TO THE REGION ON FRIDAY HAS LONG SINCE MOVED OUT INTO THE UPPER PLAINS...MEANWHILE A BROAD UPPER LOW WAS DEEPENING OFF THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COAST. IN BETWEEN...SKIES WERE SUNNY WITH DESERT TEMPERATURES GENERALLY IN THE LOWER 80S AS OF 19Z. 12Z DETERMINISTIC MODELS AS WELL AS PROBABILISTIC GUIDANCE ARE IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT 7 DAYS...WITH LITTLE SPREAD NOTED IN THE MODELS UNTIL DAY 7 OR 8. THE AFOREMENTIONED UPPER LOW WEST OF CALIFORNIA WILL MOVE INLAND AND INTO ARIZONA ON MONDAY. PWATS AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM WILL NOT BE ANYWHERE NEAR AS MOIST AS WHAT WAS OBSERVED A FEW DAYS AGO...MODEL CONSENSUS SUGGESTS VALUES WILL ONLY APPROACH 0.5 TO 0.6 INCHES MONDAY AFTERNOON /WITHIN A FEW PERCENT OF NORMAL FOR MID MAY/. MOISTURE TRANSPORT AHEAD OF THIS TROUGH IS A BIT ANOMALOUS HOWEVER /APPROACHING THE 90TH PERCENTILE IN AREAS EAST OF PHOENIX/. NAEFS IS SUGGESTING A BROAD 10-20 PERCENT CHANCE OF RAINFALL MAINLY NORTH/EAST OF PHOENIX MONDAY AFTERNOON AND THIS SEEMS REASONABLE GIVEN UPSLOPE COMPONENT TO THE FLOW. THE DESERTS WILL BE HARD PRESSED TO SEE MUCH IN THE WAY OF RAINFALL...MORE THAN LIKELY LOOKING AT INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND A STRAY SPRINKLE OR LIGHT SHOWER BUT THAT`S ABOUT IT. LATEST HI-RES GUIDANCE IS ALSO MATCHES THIS LINE OF THINKING. TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY WILL SEE WEAK RIDGING/BROAD SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW BUILD ACROSS THE AREA IN THE WAKE OF THE DEPARTING UPPER LOW. THIS WILL RESULT IN SLOWLY INCREASING TEMPERATURES ALTHOUGH HIGHS AT NO POINT DURING THIS PERIOD APPEAR TO CLIMB ABOVE NORMAL. LOOKS LIKE UPPER 80S/LOWER 90S ARE LIKELY FOR THE DESERTS THROUGH MID WEEK. THE PARADE OF UPPER LOWS MOVING THROUGH THE AREA CONTINUES LATE IN THE WEEK...AS YET ANOTHER LOW IS FORECAST TO MOVE THROUGH CALIFORNIA INTO ARIZONA LATE THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY. MUCH LIKE THE MONDAY SYSTEM...THERE WILL BE SOME MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROUGH BUT AT LEAST AS OF NOW IT DOESN`T LOOK MUCH ABOVE WHAT WOULD NORMALLY OCCUR IN MID/LATE MAY. GIVEN THE MODEST ISENTROPIC LIFT SUGGESTED BY THE DETERMINISTIC GUIDANCE AND THE SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL MOISTURE TRANSPORT PER THE NAEFS...ELECTED TO GO WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATION AREAS OF THE FORECAST AREA. AT THIS POINT IT DOESN`T LOOK LIKE A MAJOR RAINFALL PRODUCER BUT IT SHOULD KNOCK TEMPERATURES BACK INTO THE LOW/MID 80S. EXPECT CONDITIONS TO DRY OUT AND TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB SLIGHTLY GOING INTO NEXT WEEKEND. 
THE NEW WEEK. EXPECT PERIODS OF GUSTY WINDS THIS WEEK...INCLUDING MONDAY...DUE TO SEVERAL MORE PASSING WEATHER SYSTEMS. 
IN THE VALLEYS AND 10 TO 15 DEGREES WARMER IN THE MOUNTAINS. SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS EVENING SHOWED A CLEAR SKY OVER SE AZ WHILE OVER CALIFORNIA THERE LIES AN UPPER LEVEL TROF. THIS TROF WILL GRADUALLY MOVE EAST OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS...INCREASING THE PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS THE AREA. SURFACE WINDS MONDAY AFTERNOON OUT OF THE SW AT 15 TO 30 MPH WITH GUSTS IN THE 30 TO 45 MPH RANGE...HIGHEST IN THE MOUNTAINS. BULK OF MOISTURE WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL BE OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF ARIZONA WITH THE WHITES ON THE SOUTHERN END FOR A CHANCE OF AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS UP THERE MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. ANY FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS WITH THIS SYSTEM IS ADDRESSED IN THE FIRE WEATHER SECTION BELOW. HIGHS MONDAY WILL BE 2 TO 6 DEGREES WARMER THAN TODAY. BELOW NORMAL HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE THRU THE 7 DAY FORECAST PERIOD AS MOTHER NATURE CONTINUES TO KEEP LONG WAVE UPPER LEVEL TROFINESS OVER THE WESTERN CONUS. GOTTA LUV IT. 
THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. MAINLY LIGHT WINDS OVERNIGHT BEFORE INCREASING FROM THE SOUTHWEST ON MONDAY AFTER 16Z WITH 15-25 KT WINDS GUSTS UP TO 40 KTS. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR TAF AMENDMENTS. 
SYSTEM MOVING INTO THE AREA. THE BULK OF THE STORM WILL REMAIN TO OUR NORTH BUT A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CAN`T BE RULED OUT FOR THE WHITE MOUNTAINS MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THE MAIN IMPACT WILL BE WITH ANOTHER ROUND OF GUSTY WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY LEADING TO BORDERLINE RED FLAG THRESHOLDS MONDAY AFTERNOON. GIVEN THE MARGINAL CONDITIONS NO FIRE WEATHER HEADLINE WILL BE ISSUED AT THIS TIME. THEREAFTER...COOLER TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TUESDAY WITH SOMEWHAT LIGHTER WINDS. TEMPERATURES WILL WARM SLIGHTLY WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY BUT STILL REMAIN BELOW NORMAL. TYPICAL AFTERNOON BREEZES ARE EXPECTED EACH DAY BUT LOOK TO REMAIN BELOW CRITICAL RED FLAG THRESHOLDS. 
FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS RETURN AS A PACIFIC TROUGH MOVES THROUGH THE STATE. A BRIEF BREAK ENSUES WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WITH UNSETTLED WEATHER RETURNING BY FRIDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN COOLER THAN AVERAGE THROUGH THE COMING WEEK. 
CURRENTLY SPINNING OVER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THIS SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO DIVE SOUTHWARD TONIGHT BEFORE PUSHING EASTWARD ACROSS NORTHERN ARIZONA MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. THE CURRENT FORECAST CAPTURES THIS EVOLUTION WELL AND NO UPDATES ARE ANTICIPATED AT THIS TIME. 
SHOULD COMBINE WITH AFTERNOON INSTABILITY AND A SLIGHT UPTICK IN MOISTURE TO GENERATE SCATTERED AFTERNOON AND EVENING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MONDAY. THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS/STORMS WILL ENCOMPASS ALL OF NORTHERN ARIZONA BUT COVERAGE WILL FAVOR AREAS FROM GRAND CANYON TO WINDOW ROCK NORTHWARD. INCREASED SOUTHERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL LEAD TO BREEZY SOUTH WINDS. IN ADDITION WIND SHEAR WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR A FEW STORMS TO BECOME STRONG POSSIBLY PRODUCING HAIL AND STRONGER OUTFLOW WINDS. THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS WILL DECREASE FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE MAIN SHORTWAVE DRIVING THE TROUGH PUSHES INTO NEW MEXICO/COLORADO. WILL KEEP THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM NEAR THE UTAH BORDER TUESDAY WITH LINGERING INSTABILITY. A MOSTLY DRY SOUTHWEST FLOW TAKES SHAPE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AHEAD OF YET ANOTHER APPROACHING TROUGH. THE NEXT TROUGH MAKES ITS WAY INTO THE SOUTHWEST LATE THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY BRINGING ADDITIONAL CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THESE NEXT TWO WEATHER SYSTEMS ARE WARMER THAN THE LAST ONE AND SNOWFALL IS NOT EXPECTED BELOW 8000-9000 FEET. THIS ACTIVE SPRING PATTERN WITH LONGWAVE TROUGHING OVER THE WESTERN STATES THROUGH NEXT WEEK WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES BELOW NORMAL THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. 
TO DEVELOP AFTER 18Z MONDAY, WITH THE GREATEST COVERAGE ALONG THE NORTH OF THE MOGOLLON RIM. MVFR/IFR VISIBILITY IS POSSIBLE UNDER THE HEAVIER SHOWERS, WITH STRONG, ERRATIC SURFACE WINDS POSSIBLE IN THE VICINITY OF STORMS. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR TAF AMENDMENTS. 
GUSTY SOUTHERLY/SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS ACROSS NORTHERN ARIZONA MONDAY. THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MONDAY AFTERNOON. TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE ON TUESDAY. DRIER CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...WITH THUNDERSTORM CHANCES RETURNING FRIDAY. EXPECT BREEZY SOUTHWEST WINDS EACH DAY WITH DAYTIME TEMPERATURES RUNNING A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. 
AFTERNOON SOUTHWEST BREEZES. ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY...STRONGER WINDS AND CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS RETURN AS A PACIFIC TROUGH MOVES THROUGH THE STATE. A BRIEF BREAK ENSUES WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WITH UNSETTLED WEATHER RETURNING BY FRIDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN COOLER THAN AVERAGE THROUGH THE COMING WEEK. 
CALIFORNIA THIS AFTERNOON WHICH HAS PUSHED THE SHORTWAVE RIDGE EAST OF ARIZONA. THIS LOW PRESSURE TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE SOUTH TONIGHT AND THEN EASTWARD ACROSS ARIZONA MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. MODERATE SYNOPTIC SCALE ASCENT SHOULD COMBINE WITH AFTERNOON INSTABILITY AND A SLIGHT UPTICK IN MOISTURE TO GENERATE SCATTERED AFTERNOON AND EVENING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MONDAY. THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS/STORMS WILL ENCOMPASS ALL OF NORTHERN ARIZONA BUT COVERAGE WILL FAVOR AREAS FROM GRAND CANYON TO WINDOW ROCK NORTHWARD. INCREASED SOUTHERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL LEAD TO BREEZY SOUTH WINDS. IN ADDITION WIND SHEAR WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR A FEW STORMS TO BECOME STRONG POSSIBLY PRODUCING HAIL AND STRONGER OUTFLOW WINDS. THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS WILL DECREASE FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE MAIN SHORTWAVE DRIVING THE TROUGH PUSHES INTO NEW MEXICO/COLORADO. WILL KEEP THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM NEAR THE UTAH BORDER TUESDAY WITH LINGERING INSTABILITY. A MOSTLY DRY SOUTHWEST FLOW TAKES SHAPE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AHEAD OF YET ANOTHER APPROACHING TROUGH. THE NEXT TROUGH MAKES ITS WAY INTO THE SOUTHWEST LATE THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY BRINGING ADDITIONAL CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THESE NEXT TWO WEATHER SYSTEMS ARE WARMER THAN THE LAST ONE AND SNOWFALL IS NOT EXPECTED BELOW 8000-9000 FEET. THIS ACTIVE SPRING PATTERN WITH LONGWAVE TROUGHING OVER THE WESTERN STATES THROUGH NEXT WEEK WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES BELOW NORMAL THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. 
OVER NORTHERN ARIZONA THROUGH MOST OF THE TAF PERIOD. SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP AFTER 18Z MONDAY...MAINLY AFFECTING THE TERMINAL AERODROMES ALONG AND WEST OF HIGHWAY 89 AND I-17. TEMPO MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS IN THUNDERSTORMS COULD IMPACT THOSE SITES. HOWEVER...DUE TO TIMING UNCERTAINTY...WILL INDICATE SAID POSSIBILITY WITH A VCTS FOR NOW. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR TAF AMENDMENTS. 
SOUTH-CENTRAL ARIZONA INCLUDING KPHX...KIWA...AND KSDL... SOUTHEAST CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHWEST ARIZONA INCLUDING KIPL AND KBLH... AFTER A NIGHT OF MAINLY CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS...ALL OF TERMINALS WILL SEE AN INCREASE IN CLOUDINESS AND AFTERNOON WINDS AS ANOTHER PACIFIC WEATHER DISTURBANCE MOVES OVER THE REGION. SCT-BKN MID-HIGH CLOUD LAYERS WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REGION BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. THERE IS A REMOTE CHANCE THAT SPRINKLES/LIGHT SHOWERS COULD AFFECT THE PHX AREA TERMINALS MONDAY AFTERNOON AS WELL...BUT CONFIDENCE IS FAR TOO LOW TO INCLUDE IN THE TAFS AT THIS TIME. WIND SPEEDS WILL LIKELY PEAK IN THE 15-18KT RANGE ON MONDAY AFTERNOON...WITH GUSTS RISING INTO THE 18-23KT RANGE...FROM A WESTERLY OR SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION. AVIATION DISCUSSION NOT UPDATED FOR AMENDED TAFS. 



WITH AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS (ABOVE 400 MB)ALIGNED ACROSS OUR AREA AND A LOW LEVEL...PRIMARILY NEAR 850 MB DRAPED FROM ANDROS ISLAND INTO THE BAHAMAS...SIGNIFICANT DRY AIR WILL PERSIST ALONG THE FLORIDA KEYS FOR THE BALANCE OF TODAY. SO DESPITE A FAVORABLE NORTHEAST TO EAST LOW LEVEL TRAJECTORY...CLOUD LINE VERTICAL GROWTH WILL BE SEVERELY HAMPERED BY DRY AIR ENTRAINMENT SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY. OTHERWISE...A MEAN NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST STEERING FLOW MAY ALLOW SOME CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY TO AT LEAST THREATEN OUR REGION THIS EVENING. WITH THAT SAID...HAVE UPDATED THE PUBLIC ZONE FORECAST TO NUDGE POPS DOWN TO 20 PERCENT AND REMOVE THUNDER. 
WITH A SPLIT WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE LYING ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA AND INTO THE SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO...NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS OF 10 KNOTS OR LESS CAN BE EXPECTED FROM HAWK CHANNEL NORTHWARD EXCEPT 10 TO 15 KNOTS ON THE FLORIDA STRAITS. OTHERWISE...ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE ANTICIPATED ON ALL KEYS COASTAL WATERS. 
VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO PREVAIL MOST OF TODAY AT THE KEY WEST AND MARATHON TERMINALS. EAST NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS BETWEEN 5 AND 10 KNOTS WILL BE OBSERVED. CLOUDS FORMING ALONG THE ISLANDS WILL AFFECT BOTH TERMINALS WITH CLOUD BASES BETWEEN 028 AND 035 THROUGH THE AFTERNOON HOURS. 
IN 2006...THE DAILY RECORD LOW TEMPERATURE OF 66F WAS RECORDED IN KEY WEST. 
FL...NONE. GM...NONE. 
THE MORNING MIAMI SOUNDING REGISTERED PW AT ONLY 1.06 INCHES...IN THE LOWEST 10 PERCENTILE HISTORICALLY. SO A DRY AIRMASS HAS MOVED INTO SOUTH FLORIDA FROM THE NORTHEAST. THIS ALONG WITH A CAP BETWEEN 4-6.7K FT IS EXPECTED TO LIMIT CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...A FEW SHOWERS HAVE RECENTLY DEVELOPED OVER THE OFFSHORE ATLANTIC AS MOISTURE IS BEGINNING TO INCREASE..BUT IT IS SUBTLE. SO ISOLATED ACTIVITY IS POSSIBLE, MAINLY SOUTH OF ALLIGATOR ALLEY SO WILL LEAVE POPS UNTOUCHED THIS MORNING AS THEY WERE RATHER LOW TO BEGIN WITH. HOWEVER, SHOULD ANY TSTORMS MANAGE TO DEVELOP IN THIS HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT, BELIEVE THEY WOULD BE OVER THE RURAL INTERIOR, SO WILL REMOVE TSTORM MENTION FROM THE BROWARD AND MIAMI-DADE METROPOLITAN AREAS. NO OTHER CHANGES ARE NEEDED THIS MORNING. /GREGORIA 
AVIATION... VFR WILL PREVAIL WITH ANY SHOWERS OR TSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH WILL BE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN...EXPECTED TO REMAIN AWAY FROM THE TERMINALS. EAST WINDS WILL INCREASE TO AROUND 10 KT EXCEPT A W-NW GULF COAST SEA BREEZE DEVELOPING AT KAPF IN THE AFTERNOON. /GREGORIA PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 400 AM EDT TUE MAY 19 2015/ DISCUSSION... MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE EXTENDS FROM THE NORTHEAST GULF NORTHEASTWARD ALONG THE EASTERN SEABOARD. THIS WILL IMPART A LIGHT NORTH TO NORTHEASTERLY WIND ALOFT...WITH ANY SHOWERS AND STORMS THAT DEVELOP MOVING SLOWLY SOUTHWESTWARD. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY FROM EARLY THIS MORNING SHOWED DRY AIR OVER THE BAHAMAS AND THE EASTERN HALF OF THE REGION ALONG THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGE. AN INVERSION WILL REMAIN AT 750-800MB...AND RAIN CHANCES WILL REMAIN LOW TODAY...WITH THE BEST CHANCE ACROSS MAINLAND MONROE AND INTERIOR PORTIONS OF MIAMI-DADE COUNTY. AT THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WAS IN CONTROL ACROSS THE REGION. SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE TO JUST WEST OF MAINE THIS AFTERNOON...WITH A COLD FRONT PUSHING INTO THE SOUTHEAST AND NEAR THE FLORIDA/GEORGIA BORDER BY THE EVENING. A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY THEN ENTERS NORTHERN FLORIDA ON WEDNESDAY AND THE LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGE WILL WEAKEN. MODELS HAVE BACKED OFF ON SIGNIFICANT MOISTENING FOR THE EAST COAST METRO AREAS...WITH SOME DRY AIR REMAINING IN LOW/MID LEVELS. THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS ALONG THE SEA BREEZE BOUNDARIES...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE INTERIOR. FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...LINGERING/WEAKENING FRONT ACROSS THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE ALONG WITH LIGHT WESTERLY STORM MOTION FAVORS SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND STORMS ACROSS THE INTERIOR WITH PERIPHERAL SCATTERED ACTIVITY FAVORING EAST COAST. BY THE WEEKEND AND EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ONCE AGAIN TO THE NORTH WITH MODERATE EASTERLY FLOW RETURNING. WITH THE STRONGER EASTERLY FLOW...STREAMER SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE IN THE MORNING TO EARLY AFTERNOON FOR THE EAST COAST METRO AREAS...WITH SCATTERED DIURNAL GARDEN VARIETY CONVECTION ACROSS THE INTERIOR AND GULF COAST. EASTERLY STORM MOTION FAVORING INTERIOR AND WEST COAST SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH THE PERIOD. AVIATION... HIGH PRESSURE KEEPING THE WEATHER MOSTLY QUIET ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA, ESPECIALLY FOR THE ATLANTIC COAST. THERE MAY BE SOME ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS IN THE INTERIOR AND ALONG THE GULF COAST LATER TODAY. HOWEVER, THE ONLY SITE THAT MAY SEE SOME AFFECTS IS KAPF. OTHERWISE, VFR CONDITIONS FOR THE OTHER TAF SITES THROUGH THE TAF PERIOD. FOR KAPF, HAVE NOT MENTIONED ANY REDUCTIONS TO FLIGHT CATEGORIES AS OF YET, AND NO MENTION OF CONVECTION AS IT MAY NOT DIRECTLY IMPACT THE AIRPORT. SO, VFR FOR KAPF FOR NOW, BUT THEY MAY SEE SOME BRIEF PERIODS OF IFR IF THEY ARE IMPACTED BY ANY CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON. MARINE... HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WILL KEEP THE WEATHER MOSTLY QUIET OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA COASTAL WATERS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. THE APPROACHING AFOREMENTIONED WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL STALL BY WEDNESDAY EVENING OVER NORTH CENTRAL FLORIDA. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR AN INCREASE IN SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY FROM LATE WEDNESDAY THROUGH LATE IN THE WEEKEND PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WATERS WITH OTHERWISE NORMAL DIURNAL PATTERN. WIND AND SEAS WILL REMAIN BELOW EXERCISE CAUTION AND/OR ADVISORY LEVELS THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. 
FL...NONE. AM...NONE. GM...NONE. 
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE AXIS HAS BEEN PUSHED SOUTH OF THE REGION ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AS MID LEVEL SHORTWAVE ACRS THE SERN U.S. HAS WEAKENED AND DE-AMPLIFIED. THIS HAS INCREASED MOISTURE LEVELS IN THE ATMOSPHERE ACROSS ALL OF SE GA AND NE FL TODAY WITH MORNING SOUNDINGS SHOWING BETWEEN 1.6" TO 1.8" INCHES OF PRECIPITABLE WATER THIS ALONG WITH SLIGHT COOLING IN THE THE MID LEVELS AS 500MB TEMPS HAVE FALLEN TO -9C/-10C RANGE. STEERING FLOW IS OUT OF THE NORTHWEST AND STORM MOTION WILL TOWARDS THE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTH AROUND 5-10 MPH...AND A FEW STRONG STORMS WITH GUSTY WINDS UP TO 50 MPH/SMALL HAIL/FREQUENT LIGHTNING ARE STILL POSSIBLE ALONG WITH LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINFALL DUE TO SLOW STORM MOTION. THE NORTHWEST STEERING FLOW WILL NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE ATLC COAST SEA BREEZE TO MOVE INLAND PAST THE I-95 CORRIDOR AND ALMOST TO THE U.S. 301 CORRIDOR AND THIS IS WHERE STORM ACTIVITY WILL BE MAXIMIZED WITH COVERAGE CLOSE TO 50-60% WITH OUTFLOWS GENERATED TO CONTINUE TO KICK OFF CONVECTION WELL INTO THE EVENING HOURS...THEN FADING AFTER SUNSET...AND ENDING JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT. DAYTIME HEATING AHEAD OF THE CONVECTION WILL PUSH WELL INTO THE LOWER 90S INLAND AND MIDDLE/UPPER 80S COAST AND WITH DEWPOINTS AROUND 70 DEGREES...HEAT INDICES WILL ACTUALLY REACH INTO THE 95-100 DEGREE RANGE AT TIMES. FAIR SKIES EXPECTED OVERNIGHT WITH CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDS SLOWLY DISSIPATING AND SOME PATCHY 3-5 MILE FOG POSSIBLE TOWARDS MORNING BUT NOT EXPECTING TO BE SIGNIFICANT AT THIS TIME. 
PREVAILING VFR TODAY WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS/STORMS AT ALL TERMINALS AND 12Z TAF SET HAS ALREADY INCLUDED TEMPO GROUPS FOR STORMS THIS AFTERNOON GENERALLY FOR 18Z-22Z TIME FRAME...ALTHOUGH THEY COULD LINGER PAST 00Z ALONG THE I-95 CORRIDOR. THE STRONGEST ACTIVITY COULD PRODUCE SOME MVFR CIGS/GUSTY WINDS TO 30 KNOTS. THEN A RETURN TO VFR WITH CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDS OVERNIGHT AFTER 03Z. 
SW WINDS 10 KNOTS BECOMING S/SE 10-15 KNOTS THIS AFTERNOON THEN BACK AROUND TO SOUTHWEST TONIGHT. SEAS GENERALLY IN THE 2-4 FT RANGE. SHOWER/STORM ACTIVITY WILL IMPACT MAINLY THE NEARSHORE ZONES. RIP CURRENTS: LOW TO MODERATE RISK OF RIP CURRENTS LINGERS INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. 
FL...NONE. GA...NONE. AM...NONE. 
A RELAXED SURFACE RIDGE...WITH LIGHT WINDS...ACROSS NORTH CENTRAL FL THIS MORNING WILL SAG INTO SOUTH-CENTRAL FL FOR THE AFTERNOON. AS IT DOES THE GRADIENT TIGHTENS SLIGHTLY WHICH ALONG WITH THE WEST COASTAL SEA BREEZE RESULTS IN WESTERLY WINDS PUSHING ACROSS ALL COASTAL LOCATIONS AND INLAND. WITH A MOIST AND SOMEWHAT UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE IN PLACE EXPECT THE GULF SHOWERS NOW OFF THE NATURE COAST TO TRANSITION INLAND AND INCREASE TO ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS. CURRENT FORECAST GENERALLY ON TRACK BUT HAVE MADE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS IN AFTERNOON COVERAGE. 
AS A WEAK RIDGE MOVES SOUTH OVER THE WATERS TODAY WINDS BECOME WEST OR NORTHWEST AT 15 KNOTS OR LESS FOR THE AFTERNOON. MAIN CONCERN WILL BE A FEW STORMS JUST INLAND OF THE GULF THIS AFTERNOON. 
FL...NONE. GULF WATERS...NONE. 
CURRENT-TONIGHT...WEAK SURFACE RIDGING OVER THE AREA WILL SLOWLY SLIDE SOUTH AND EAST OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. SHORTWAVE RIDGING ALOFT WILL ALSO WEAKEN AND SLIDE FURTHER EAST OF THE AREA. DEEP LAYER MOISTURE INCREASES OVER THE AREA...BUT AWAY/NORTHWARD FROM THE SPACE/TREASURE COASTS. THERE WILL BE A SEA BREEZE COLLISION LATER IN THE DAY OVER THE INTERIOR WITH HIGHEST POPS NEAR AND WEST OF THE I-4 CORRIDOR AT AROUND 40 PERCENT. CHANCES WILL DECREASE FURTHER EAST/SOUTH OF THIS AREA. TIMING APPEARS TO FAVOR LATER IN THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. MAXES IN THE M-U80S ALONG THE COAST AROUND AROUND 90-91F INLAND. MINS IN THE U60S-L70S.

PENINSULA WILL SLOWLY SAG SOUTH AND EAST TODAY AS A WEAK PRESSURE GRADIENT CONTINUES OVER THE AREA. LIGHT AND VARIABLE TO SOUTHWEST EARLY MORNING FLOW IS FORECAST TO BECOME ONSHORE NEAR THE COAST WITH ECSB FORMATION AND MOVEMENT INLAND. AWAY FROM THE COAST WINDS WILL BACK TO E/SE DURING THE DAY WHILE SPEEDS ARE GENERALLY AOB 10 KTS. SEAS WILL REMAIN IN THE 2-3 FT RANGE AS LIGHT WINDS COME AROUND TO SWRLY TONIGHT. 
FL...NONE. AM...NONE. 
VFR WILL PREVAIL WITH ANY SHOWERS OR TSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH WILL BE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN...EXPECTED TO REMAIN AWAY FROM THE TERMINALS. EAST WINDS WILL INCREASE TO AROUND 10 KT EXCEPT A W-NW GULF COAST SEA BREEZE DEVELOPING AT KAPF IN THE AFTERNOON. /GREGORIA 
DISCUSSION... MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE EXTENDS FROM THE NORTHEAST GULF NORTHEASTWARD ALONG THE EASTERN SEABOARD. THIS WILL IMPART A LIGHT NORTH TO NORTHEASTERLY WIND ALOFT...WITH ANY SHOWERS AND STORMS THAT DEVELOP MOVING SLOWLY SOUTHWESTWARD. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY FROM EARLY THIS MORNING SHOWED DRY AIR OVER THE BAHAMAS AND THE EASTERN HALF OF THE REGION ALONG THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGE. AN INVERSION WILL REMAIN AT 750-800MB...AND RAIN CHANCES WILL REMAIN LOW TODAY...WITH THE BEST CHANCE ACROSS MAINLAND MONROE AND INTERIOR PORTIONS OF MIAMI-DADE COUNTY. AT THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WAS IN CONTROL ACROSS THE REGION. SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE TO JUST WEST OF MAINE THIS AFTERNOON...WITH A COLD FRONT PUSHING INTO THE SOUTHEAST AND NEAR THE FLORIDA/GEORGIA BORDER BY THE EVENING. A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY THEN ENTERS NORTHERN FLORIDA ON WEDNESDAY AND THE LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGE WILL WEAKEN. MODELS HAVE BACKED OFF ON SIGNIFICANT MOISTENING FOR THE EAST COAST METRO AREAS...WITH SOME DRY AIR REMAINING IN LOW/MID LEVELS. THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS ALONG THE SEA BREEZE BOUNDARIES...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE INTERIOR. FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...LINGERING/WEAKENING FRONT ACROSS THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE ALONG WITH LIGHT WESTERLY STORM MOTION FAVORS SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND STORMS ACROSS THE INTERIOR WITH PERIPHERAL SCATTERED ACTIVITY FAVORING EAST COAST. BY THE WEEKEND AND EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ONCE AGAIN TO THE NORTH WITH MODERATE EASTERLY FLOW RETURNING. WITH THE STRONGER EASTERLY FLOW...STREAMER SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE IN THE MORNING TO EARLY AFTERNOON FOR THE EAST COAST METRO AREAS...WITH SCATTERED DIURNAL GARDEN VARIETY CONVECTION ACROSS THE INTERIOR AND GULF COAST. EASTERLY STORM MOTION FAVORING INTERIOR AND WEST COAST SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH THE PERIOD. AVIATION... HIGH PRESSURE KEEPING THE WEATHER MOSTLY QUIET ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA, ESPECIALLY FOR THE ATLANTIC COAST. THERE MAY BE SOME ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS IN THE INTERIOR AND ALONG THE GULF COAST LATER TODAY. HOWEVER, THE ONLY SITE THAT MAY SEE SOME AFFECTS IS KAPF. OTHERWISE, VFR CONDITIONS FOR THE OTHER TAF SITES THROUGH THE TAF PERIOD. FOR KAPF, HAVE NOT MENTIONED ANY REDUCTIONS TO FLIGHT CATEGORIES AS OF YET, AND NO MENTION OF CONVECTION AS IT MAY NOT DIRECTLY IMPACT THE AIRPORT. SO, VFR FOR KAPF FOR NOW, BUT THEY MAY SEE SOME BRIEF PERIODS OF IFR IF THEY ARE IMPACTED BY ANY CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON. MARINE... HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WILL KEEP THE WEATHER MOSTLY QUIET OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA COASTAL WATERS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. THE APPROACHING AFOREMENTIONED WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL STALL BY WEDNESDAY EVENING OVER NORTH CENTRAL FLORIDA. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR AN INCREASE IN SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY FROM LATE WEDNESDAY THROUGH LATE IN THE WEEKEND PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WATERS WITH OTHERWISE NORMAL DIURNAL PATTERN. WIND AND SEAS WILL REMAIN BELOW EXERCISE CAUTION AND/OR ADVISORY LEVELS THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. 
[THROUGH 12Z WEDNESDAY]... FOG AND LOW CEILINGS HAVE BEEN A BIT MORE WIDESPREAD THAN ORIGINALLY FORECAST. GENERALLY MVFR VISIBILITIES ARE SCATTERED ACROSS THE REGION WITH IFR/LIFR ACROSS PARTS OF NORTH FLORIDA, ESPECIALLY SOUTH OF I-10, AFFECTING ECP. IFR CEILINGS ARE SCATTERED ABOUT AS WELL, WHERE MID/UPPER LEVEL CLOUDS PASS OVERHEAD. ALL RESTRICTIONS SHOULD CLEAR OVER THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO, WITH VFR PREVAILING FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING. EXPECT ANOTHER ROUND OF RESTRICTIONS TONIGHT, WITH IFR MOST LIKELY AT DHN AND ECP. 
THE MID-UPPER TROPOSPHERIC FLOW WILL BE QUASI-ZONAL ACROSS MUCH OF THE SOUTHEAST, WITH A FEW MINOR UNDULATIONS TRANSLATING EASTWARD. A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL STALL EAST TO WEST ACROSS CENTRAL GA AND AL TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY, BUT IT MAY MAKE ANOTHER PUSH INTO OUR FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY. DESPITE THE PROXIMITY OF THE FRONT, THE Q-G FORCING ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA WILL BE WEAK, SO IT APPEARS THAT MESOSCALE FEATURES WILL BE THE MAIN DRIVERS OF DEEP MOIST CONVECTION. OUR DAYTIME POP IS GENERALLY AROUND 30 PERCENT EACH DAY, WITH POPS DECREASING TO LESS THAN 20 PERCENT EACH NIGHT. THE 00 UTC GFS AND ECMWF DIFFER ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE FRONT ON THURSDAY. THE GFS TAKES THE FRONT DEEP INTO OUR FORECAST AREA, WHICH WOULD KEEP DEEP MOIST CONVECTION PINNED NEAR THE COAST AND ACROSS NORTH FL. THE ECMWF KEEPS THE FRONT NORTH OF OUR FORECAST AREA, WHICH WOULD INDICATE A SLIGHTLY WETTER (AND MORE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED) RAIN PATTERN. OUR FORECAST IS IN BETWEEN THE TWO SOLUTIONS. LOWS WILL BE NEAR 70 AND HIGHS IN THE LOWER 90S. WEAK WIND FIELDS ALOFT SHOULD PREVENT SIGNIFICANT STORM ORGANIZATION, BUT THIS TIME OF YEAR THERE IS USUALLY ENOUGH SURFACE HEATING AND MOISTURE FOR A STORM OR TWO TO BRIEFLY BECOME MARGINALLY SEVERE. 
WITH AN EAST-WEST ORIENTED FRONT TO THE NORTH AND HIGHER PRESSURE TO THE SOUTH, WINDS WILL GENERALLY BE FROM THE WEST THROUGH AT LEAST THURSDAY. WINDS WILL BE ONSHORE NEAR 15 KNOTS EACH AFTERNOON AND EVENING, THEN NORTHWEST LESS THAN 10 KNOTS OVERNIGHT AND IN THE MORNINGS. 
WIDESPREAD, HEAVY RAIN IS UNLIKELY THROUGH THIS WEEKEND. THE LOCAL RIVERS WILL REMAIN BELOW THEIR LOCAL ACTIONS STAGES. 
FL...NONE. GA...NONE. AL...NONE. GM...NONE. 
CONTINUES TO SLOWLY SHIFT EWD WITH SKIES CLEARING A BIT THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. ANTICIPATE SOME PATCHY FOG TO DEVELOP OVER INTERIOR AREAS ESPECIALLY WHERE RAINFALL OCCURRED YESTERDAY. WINDS ARE LIGHT SWLY AND TEMPS ARE IN THE LOWER 70S. MID AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGE IS NOTED FROM THE ERN GULF OF MEXICO TO THE CAROLINAS WITH SFC RIDGE OVER N CENTRAL FL AND ERN CENTRAL GULF/WRN ATLC. 
A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE FROM SOUTHEAST GEORGIA WEDNESDAY EVENING INTO NORTHEAST FLORIDA BY THURSDAY MORNING...BECOMING DIFFUSE ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA THURSDAY NIGHT. RESIDUAL PRECIP WEDNESDAY EVENING WILL END AFTER SUNSET...WITH MAINLY DIURNAL CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY AFTN/EVENING AS THE FRONT IS RATHER WEAK. HIGHS THURSDAY WILL RANGE FROM THE MID/UPPER 80S CLOSER TO THE COAST TO THE LOWER 90S INLAND. MILD AND MUGGY UPPER 60S/LOWER 70S WILL PREVAIL FOR LOWS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY NIGHT. 
PREVAILING VFR THROUGH TODAY BUT A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS EXPECTED AT ALL TAFS TODAY AND CONTINUED WITH VCTS AROUND 16Z-18Z WITH HIGHEST CHANCES OF TSRA AROUND THE 20Z-23Z TIME FRAME. MVFR CONDS AND GUSTY WINDS EXPECTED IN ANY STORMS. CHANCES WILL DECREASE BY 02Z-04Z TIME FRAME WITH SKIES BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY. 
A FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLOWLY MAKES ITS WAY DOWN INTO THE DEEP SOUTH. OVERALL DAYTIME SOUTHEASTERLY SEA BREEZES AT 10-15 KNOTS WILL BECOME SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST AT 10-15 KNOTS AT NIGHT. FLOW DOES BEGIN TO TRANSITION TO ELY AND INCREASE BY SATURDAY AS HIGH PRES BUILDS DOWN THE COAST. SEAS WILL GENERALLY REMAIN IN THE 2-4 FT RANGE AND DO NOT EXPECT HEADLINES UNTIL POSSIBLY SATURDAY. RIP CURRENTS: LOW TO MODERATE RISK OF RIPS WILL LINGER INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. 
CURRENTLY - A SPLIT SURFACE RIDGE PATTERN IS IN PLACE ACROSS FLORIDA AND THE ADJACENT BODIES OF WATER AS A TROUGH HAS SLIPPED INTO THE EASTERN UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT...WINDS ARE LIGHT AND MOSTLY EASTERLY. SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS EMERGED OFF OF SOUTH FLORIDA LATE YESTERDAY...AND MOVED SOUTHWESTWARD THROUGH MAINLY THROUGH THE LOWER KEYS...AND ARE NOW ON THE NEAR AND OFFSHORE WATERS SURROUNDING THE MARQUESAS KEYS AND REBECCA SHOAL. TEMPERATURES ARE NEAR NORMAL WITH DEW POINTS IN THE MID 70S. FORECAST - THE SPLIT RIDGE ACROSS FLORIDA WILL KEEP A COL NEARBY THROUGH MUCH OF THE WEEK. MEANWHILE...A WEAK LOWER LEVEL RIDGE WILL BE CENTERED OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO TODAY INTO TONIGHT...BEFORE EDGING BACK EASTWARD OVER FLORIDA MID WEEK. CONSEQUENTLY...THE STEERING FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE BACKED A BIT FURTHER TODAY...AND ACTIVITY THAT MOVES OFF OF SOUTH FLORIDA SHOULD BE ABLE TO MORE DIRECTLY IMPINGE ON THE ISLAND CHAIN. WITH THAT SAID...RAIN CHANCES WILL BE QUITE LOW FOR MUCH OF TODAY. WILL INCLUDE TRANSITIONAL WORDING FOR CHANCE OF SHOWERS LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL. THE LOW LEVEL FLOW IS EVEN WEAKER FROM WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. AS A RESULT...CONVECTION AFFECTING THE KEYS WILL BE ENTIRELY OUTFLOW DRIVEN...AND CHAOTIC. FOR THIS REASON...WILL HOLD ON TO SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS THROUGH THE SECOND HALF OF THE WEEK. NO TEMPERATURE TREND IS EXPECTED. 
A SPLIT RIDGE PATTERN ACROSS FLORIDA WILL KEEP A COL NEAR THE KEYS. WINDS WILL BE WEAK AND MOSTLY EASTERLY....BUT WITH THE COL WITHIN KEYS WATERS...WINDS WILL VARY QUITE FAR FROM EASTERLY...ESPECIALLY OVER OUR GULF SIDE WATERS...AND WATERS NEAR SOUTH FLORIDA. A STRONG HIGH PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO EVENTUALLY EMERGE OFF THE EASTERN UNITED STATES THIS WEEKEND...FRESHENING EASTERLY BREEZES BY SUNDAY. 
VFR WILL PREVAIL AT THE EYW AND MTH TERMINALS THROUGH THE MORNING. AN EARLY AFTERNOON CLOUD LINE IS POSSIBLE FOR BOTH TERMINALS...BEFORE DRIER AIR WORKS INTO THE AREA. TEMPORARY PERIODS OF MVFR CIGS BASED AT 020 CAN BE EXPECTED AS THIS CLOUD LINE MATURES. RAIN CHANCES WILL BE RELEGATED TO THIS EVENING AS PRECIPITATION PRESSES SOUTHWEST FROM THE SOUTHERN FLORIDA PENINSULA. 
1955...HAIL SMALLER THAN 3/4" FELL IN KEY WEST. CLIMATE RECORDS HAVE BEEN KEPT IN KEY WEST SINCE 1871. 
MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE EXTENDS FROM THE NORTHEAST GULF NORTHEASTWARD ALONG THE EASTERN SEABOARD. THIS WILL IMPART A LIGHT NORTH TO NORTHEASTERLY WIND ALOFT...WITH ANY SHOWERS AND STORMS THAT DEVELOP MOVING SLOWLY SOUTHWESTWARD. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY FROM EARLY THIS MORNING SHOWED DRY AIR OVER THE BAHAMAS AND THE EASTERN HALF OF THE REGION ALONG THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGE. AN INVERSION WILL REMAIN AT 750-800MB...AND RAIN CHANCES WILL REMAIN LOW TODAY...WITH THE BEST CHANCE ACROSS MAINLAND MONROE AND INTERIOR PORTIONS OF MIAMI-DADE COUNTY. AT THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WAS IN CONTROL ACROSS THE REGION. SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE TO JUST WEST OF MAINE THIS AFTERNOON...WITH A COLD FRONT PUSHING INTO THE SOUTHEAST AND NEAR THE FLORIDA/GEORGIA BORDER BY THE EVENING. A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY THEN ENTERS NORTHERN FLORIDA ON WEDNESDAY AND THE LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGE WILL WEAKEN. MODELS HAVE BACKED OFF ON SIGNIFICANT MOISTENING FOR THE EAST COAST METRO AREAS...WITH SOME DRY AIR REMAINING IN LOW/MID LEVELS. THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS ALONG THE SEA BREEZE BOUNDARIES...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE INTERIOR. FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...LINGERING/WEAKENING FRONT ACROSS THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE ALONG WITH LIGHT WESTERLY STORM MOTION FAVORS SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND STORMS ACROSS THE INTERIOR WITH PERIPHERAL SCATTERED ACTIVITY FAVORING EAST COAST. BY THE WEEKEND AND EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ONCE AGAIN TO THE NORTH WITH MODERATE EASTERLY FLOW RETURNING. WITH THE STRONGER EASTERLY FLOW...STREAMER SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE IN THE MORNING TO EARLY AFTERNOON FOR THE EAST COAST METRO AREAS...WITH SCATTERED DIURNAL GARDEN VARIETY CONVECTION ACROSS THE INTERIOR AND GULF COAST. EASTERLY STORM MOTION FAVORING INTERIOR AND WEST COAST SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH THE PERIOD. 
HIGH PRESSURE KEEPING THE WEATHER MOSTLY QUIET ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA, ESPECIALLY FOR THE ATLANTIC COAST. THERE MAY BE SOME ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS IN THE INTERIOR AND ALONG THE GULF COAST LATER TODAY. HOWEVER, THE ONLY SITE THAT MAY SEE SOME AFFECTS IS KAPF. OTHERWISE, VFR CONDITIONS FOR THE OTHER TAF SITES THROUGH THE TAF PERIOD. FOR KAPF, HAVE NOT MENTIONED ANY REDUCTIONS TO FLIGHT CATEGORIES AS OF YET, AND NO MENTION OF CONVECTION AS IT MAY NOT DIRECTLY IMPACT THE AIRPORT. SO, VFR FOR KAPF FOR NOW, BUT THEY MAY SEE SOME BRIEF PERIODS OF IFR IF THEY ARE IMPACTED BY ANY CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON. 
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WILL KEEP THE WEATHER MOSTLY QUIET OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA COASTAL WATERS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. THE APPROACHING AFOREMENTIONED WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL STALL BY WEDNESDAY EVENING OVER NORTH CENTRAL FLORIDA. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR AN INCREASE IN SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY FROM LATE WEDNESDAY THROUGH LATE IN THE WEEKEND PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WATERS WITH OTHERWISE NORMAL DIURNAL PATTERN. WIND AND SEAS WILL REMAIN BELOW EXERCISE CAUTION AND/OR ADVISORY LEVELS THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. 
CURRENT...WEAKENING SFC HIGH EAST OF FL WITH RIDGE AXIS EXTENDING BACK TO THE CTRL PENINSULA. SMALL BAND OF BKN-OVC MID LEVEL CLOUDS FORMED OVER THE NRN CWA AROUND 05Z AND HAS BEEN SAGGING SWD WHILST THINNING OUT. 08Z/3AM TEMPS WERE IN MOSTLY IN THE U60S-L70S...WITH EXCEPTIONS BEING THE NORMALLY COOLER ASOS/AWOS SITES AT KOBE/KFPR AT 64F/65F RESPECTIVELY. TODAY/TONIGHT...TODAY WILL BE A DAY OF TRANSITION AS THE STRONG MID TO UPPER LEVEL RIDGE THAT HAS BEEN ATOP FL THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS FINALLY BREAKS DOWN. THIS ALLOWS INCREASING MID LEVEL WRLY FLOW TO SHOVE THE ATLC SFC RIDGE GETS SHOVED AWAY TO THE EAST...WITH ITS WRN "NOSE" INTO FL COLLAPSING. WEAK SYNOPTIC FLOW ABOUT THE BROADENED AXIS WILL AVERAGE ABOUT 5KT TODAY...ALLOWING THE ECSB TO FORM AND MOVE STEADILY INLAND. WWD PUSH WILL BE A BIT SLOWER THAN THE PAST FEW DAYS... WITH A LITTLE MORE "RESISTANCE" OVER THE NERN CWA WHERE WINDS WILL TREND TWD SSW-SW. LOCAL AIR MASS WILL BE A BIT LESS CAPPED THAN PREV DAYS...WITH A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE FOR LATE AFTN/EARLY EVENING CONVECTION TO DEVELOP ALONG SEA/LAKE BREEZES BDRY COLLISIONS... MAINLY OVER NORTH/INLAND AREAS...WHERE LOW-MID END SCT POPS ARE FCST. SHRA/TS EXPECTED TO LINGER A FEW HRS POST-SUNSET...SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS SEEN JUST NORTH OF THE CWA LAST EVENING. MAXES IN THE M-U80S ALONG THE COAST AROUND AROUND 90-91F INLAND. MINS IN THE U60S-L70S. WEDNESDAY-THURSDAY...MODELS CONTINUE TO POINT TO WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AS THE WETTEST DAYS OF THE WEEK AS A WEAK SURFACE FRONT WASHES OUT ACROSS THE NORTH/CENTRAL FL PENINSULA UNDERNEATH A WEAK MID LEVEL TROUGH ACROSS THE EASTERN US. DEEPER MOISTURE POOLED ALONG THE STALLING FRONTAL BOUNDARY COUPLED WITH SOME ADDITIONAL INSTABILITY FROM THE TROUGH ALOFT WILL BRING SCATTERED AFTERNOON AND EVENING SHOWERS AND STORMS WITH WEST- NORTHWEST STEERING FLOW WILL FOCUSING MOST ACTIVITY TOWARDS THE EAST COAST LATE IN THE DAY. OFFSHORE FLOW WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO DELAY THE ONSET/INLAND MOVEMENT OF THE EAST COAST SEA BREEZE...BUT NOT PREVENT IT ALTOGETHER. MODELS STILL SHOW THE SEA BREEZE MAKING A GOOD INLAND PUSH WEST OF I-95...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE TREASURE COAST. LATER SEABREEZE WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO WARM INTO THE UPPER 80S AND LOW 90S...EVEN AT THE COAST. FRIDAY... ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TROUGH PASSING TO THE NORTH HELPS CONSOLIDATE WEAK SURFACE WAVE/LOW ALONG STALLED TROUGH OFF TO OUR NORTHEAST. THIS WILL PUSH THE REMNANT FRONT AND ASSOCIATED DEEP MOISTURE OUT OF THE REGION. UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDING IN THE VICINITY WILL ALSO SHIFT STEERING FLOW TO A LESS FAVORABLE NORTHERLY. LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL BE LIGHT ENOUGH FOR SEABREEZE TO DEVELOP EARLIER WITH COLLISION HAPPENING NEAR THE CENTER OF THE PENINSULA IN THE EVENING. TEMPS CONTINUE WARM IN THE UPPER 80S COAST/LOW 90S INLAND. THE WEEKEND...SURFACE HIGH MOVES OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST NEXT WEEKEND AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS BACK OVERHEAD. WILL SEE A RETURN TO PREVAILING DEEP ONSHORE FLOW...LIKELY BREEZY AT TIMES ESPECIALLY INTO SUNDAY AS GRADIENT TIGHTENS. MID LEVEL DRYING AND WARMING UNDER RIDGE MAKES SIGNIFICANT DEEP CONVECTION UNLIKELY...BUT SUFFICIENT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINS FOR ONSHORE MOVING ATLANTIC SHOWERS ALONG THE COAST WITH WIDELY SCATTERED AFTERNOON CONVECTION FOCUSED OVER THE INTERIOR AND WEST FLORIDA. 
SHRA/TS PSBL AROUND THE NRN/INLAND SITES OF LEE/SFB/DAB/MCO/ISM 20Z- 03Z. 
ONSHORE SEE BREEZE CIRC DEVELOPING NEAR THE COAST. SEAS WILL REMAIN IN THE 2-3FT RANGE AS LIGHT WINDS COME AROUND TO SWRLY TONIGHT. WED-FRI...FRONTAL BOUNDARY SAGS INTO THE REGION MID-WEEK BEFORE WASHING OUT JUST SOUTH OF THE REGION INTO FRIDAY. PREVAILING WEST- SOUTHWEST WINDS AROUND 10KTS WED AND THURS WITH SOME BACKING EAST- SOUTHEAST IN THE AFTERNOONS NEAR THE COAST WITH THE SEABREEZE. GRADIENT BECOMES LIGHT ON FRIDAY WITH SEABREEZE CIRCULATION BECOMING DOMINANT BY EARLY AFTERNOON LEADING TO EAST-SOUTHEAST WINDS AROUND 10KTS. SEAS GENERALLY 2-3FT OCCASIONALLY UP TO 4FT WELL OFFSHORE. THE MAIN MARINER WEATHER HAZARD WILL BE OFFSHORE MOVING AFTERNOON/ EVENING STORMS. SAT-SUN...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE NORTH NEXT WEEKEND WITH STRENGTHENING GRADIENT LEADING TO EAST-NORTHEAST SURGE SAT AFTERNOON THEN STEADY MODERATE EAST FLOW INTO SUN. MODELS SHOWING STEADY 15KTS ONCE GRADIENT TIGHTENS WITH 15-20KTS AT TIMES DURING THE PERIOD. SEAS 2-3FT ON SATURDAY...WITH EAST FETCH BUILDING SEAS TO 4-6FT INTO LATE SUNDAY. 
A STRONG U/L REX BLOCK PERSISTS OVER THE WESTERN U.S. AND WESTERN CANADA...WITH SPLIT FLOW AROUND THE BLOCKING PATTERN. SOUTHERN STREAM FLOW EXTENDS FROM THE DESERT SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS TO THE MID WEST/GREAT LAKES REGION WHERE IT MERGES WITH THE NORTHERN STREAM. U/L DISTURBANCES WILL EJECT FROM THE BASE OF THE TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHWEST U.S. AND BAJA CALIFORNIA TO THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS. A DIGGING NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH OVER CENTRAL CANADA AND THE GREAT LAKES WILL COME IN PHASE WITH A WEAKENING SOUTHERN STREAM S/W WITH U/L TROUGH TEMPORARILY SINKING SOUTH ACROSS FLORIDA. AN ASSOCIATED FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL STALL ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST U.S. AND FLORIDA TODAY AND WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL SHIFT BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS OVER WEST CENTRAL AND SOUTHWEST FLORIDA WITH ONSHORE WESTERLY FLOW DEVELOPING. THIS WILL PUSH THE WEST COAST SEA BREEZE BOUNDARY INLAND DURING THE LATE MORNING/EARLY AFTERNOON WITH SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING OVER THE INTERIOR EACH DAY AND SHIFTING EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON...WITH LOWER POPS NEAR THE COAST WITH THE BEST CHANCE OF A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM DURING THE LATE MORNING/EARLY AFTERNOON. WESTERLY FLOW OFF THE GULF WATERS WILL HOLD MAX TEMPS DOWN NEAR THE COAST EACH DAY WITH CONTINUED HIGHS IN THE LOWER 90S OVER THE INTERIOR. CONVERSELY...LIGHT WEST WINDS OFF THE RELATIVELY WARM WATERS WILL CREATE WARM MUGGY OVERNIGHT CONDITIONS NEAR THE COAST. 
SCATTERED STRATO-CU WILL DEVELOP THIS MORNING 030-040 AT ALL TERMINALS...WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING THIS AFTERNOON WITH LCL MVFR CIGS AND IFR VSBYS. BEST CHANCE OF AFTERNOON STORMS WILL BE VCNTY LAL/PGD/FMY/RSW. 
MAIN HAZARD WILL BE ISOLATED MAINLY NIGHTTIME THUNDERSTORMS WITH LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN AND GUSTY WINDS. INCREASING EASTERLY FLOW OVER THE WEEKEND MAY LEAD TO AN EASTERLY SURGE OF WIND SATURDAY NIGHT WHICH COULD REACH ADVISORY LEVELS FOR SEVERAL HOURS. 
NO FIRE WEATHER HAZARDS THROUGH THE PERIOD. RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES WILL REMAIN ABOVE CRITICAL LEVELS EACH AFTERNOON. 
DISTURBED UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL PREVAIL THIS AFTERNOON WITH A WEAK SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING FRONT. EXPECT CONVECTION TO INITIATE ALONG THE SEABREEZE FRONTS MUCH LIKE IT DID YESTERDAY. THE CONVECTIVE PATTERN WILL BECOME OUTFLOW DRIVEN LATER IN THE AFTERNOON, WITH POPS ALSO INCREASING ACROSS SOUTHEAST ALABAMA WHERE ADDITIONAL CONVERGENCE WILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG THE APPROACHING FRONT. A TYPICAL THREAT FOR AN ISOLATED STRONG STORM OR TWO WILL EXIST TODAY. HIGHS WILL PEAK IN THE UPPER 80S AND LOWER 90S REGION- WIDE. 
500 MB HEIGHTS WILL AMPLIFY SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE SOUTHEAST FOR MUCH OF THIS PERIOD, PEAKING AT AROUND 592 DM IN OUR FORECAST AREA BY THE WEEKEND OR EARLY NEXT WEEK. A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL STALL SOUTH OF OUR FORECAST AREA FRIDAY AND SATURDAY, THEN GRADUALLY DISSIPATE. OUR POP FORECAST IS NEAR CLIMATOLOGY THROUGH THE PERIOD, GENERALLY PEAKING IN THE 20-30 PERCENT RANGE EACH AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THESE POPS COULD COME DOWN A BIT FRIDAY AND SATURDAY, ESPECIALLY IN GA AND AL, IF THERE IS A DECENT PUSH OF DRY AIR INTO OUR REGION. TEMPERATURES WILL BE SEASONABLY WARM, WITH LOWS IN THE 65 TO 70 RANGE AND HIGHS NEAR 90. 
[THROUGH 06Z WEDNESDAY] IFR VISIBILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO EXPAND OUT OF THE SOUTHEAST BIG BEND AND IMPACT VLD THIS MORNING, TLH WILL LIKELY BE ON THE FRINGE OF THE IFR/LIFR VISIBILITIES, AND SHOULD REMAIN MVFR. SHORTLY AFTER SUNRISE, ALL TERMINALS WILL RETURN TO VFR (OUTSIDE OF STORMS) FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TAF. 
HAZARDOUS FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE NOT EXPECTED. 
UPDATE... SHOWERS DIMINISHING ALONG GULF COAST...THEN MOSTLY DRY NIGHT EXPECTED. PATCHY FOG CANT BE RULED OUT WESTERN INTERIOR. NO CHANGES NEEDED TO GRIDS. PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 329 PM EDT MON MAY 18 2015/ DISCUSSION... LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE IN CONTROL ACROSS THE REGION. UPR AIR ANALYSIS SHOWS STRONG LOW AND MID LEVEL RIDGE JUST UP AND DOWN THE STATE WITH CWA ON THE SOUTH AND SE END OF THAT FEATURE. WATER VAPOR LOOP SHOWS SLIGHTLY DRIER AND MORE STABLE AIRMASS IMPINGING ON THE SE COAST OF FLORIDA FROM THE ATLANTIC ON THE SOUTHEASTERN PERYPHERY OF THE LOW AND MID LEVEL RIDGE. THERMODYNAMIC PROFILES AT LOW LEVELS ARE NOT IMPRESSIVE AT ALL IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE RIDGE WITH H9 BASED INVERSION PRESENT AND MID LEVELS WARMER THAN NORMAL. THIS COMBINED WITH STORM MOTION VECTOR FROM THE ENE AROUND 10 KNOTS WILL MEAN ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING ACROSS THE INTERIOR AND TOWARDS THE SW FLORIDA COAST WITH STORMS OF THE GARDEN VARIETY TYPE. MOST STORM ACTIVITY WILL LIKELY BE JUST AROUND OR EAST OF THE NAPLES AREA WHERE STRONGEST SEA BREEZE CONVERGENCE IS ANTICIPATED. MAIN CONCERN WILL BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND LIGHTNING STRIKES AS STORM MOTION WILL SLOW DOWN ALONG C-BRZ FRONT. FOR TUESDAY SIMILAR PATTERN IS ANTICIPATED TO PREVAIL WITH MOST CONVECTION ACROSS INTERIOR AND SOUTHWEST FLORIDA COAST PARTICULARLY EAST AND SOUTH OF NAPLES AS STORM VECTOR MOTION GAINS A MORE NORTHERLY COMPONENT. THE REAL CHANGE COMES WEDNESDAY AS A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY ENTERS NORTHERN FLORIDA AND LOW AND MID LEVEL RIDGE WEAKENS CONSIDERABLY. ADDITIONALLY, PRECIPITABLE WATER JUMPS BACK UP TO WELL ABOVE NORMAL LEVELS AND WITH THAT THE CONSENSUS OF THE GUIDANCE INCREASES POPS TO NEARLY 50-60% RANGE PARTICULARLY ACROSS INTERIOR PORTIONS OF SOUTH FLORIDA WITH PERIPHERAL CONVECTION AND ABOUT EQUAL CHANCES TOWARDS BOTH EAST AND WEST COASTS METRO AREAS. BUT AGAIN BEST CHANCES REMAIN INLAND. FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY LINGERING/WEAKENING FRONT ACROSS THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE ALONG WITH LIGHT WESTERLY STORM MOTION FAVORS PATTERN AGAIN FOR SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND STORMS ACROSS THE INTERIOR WITH PERIPHERAL SCATTERED ACTIVITY FAVORING EAST COAST ON THURSDAY BUT JUST ABOUT THE SAME ON BOTH WEST AND EAST COAST METRO AREAS ON FRIDAY AS STORM MOTION VECTOR BECOMES WEAKER. BY THE WEEKEND AND EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ONCE AGAIN TO THE NORTH WITH EASTERLY STORM MOTION FAVORING INTERIOR AND WEST COAST SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION. NO ELEMENTS INDICATING MUCH MORE THAN GARDEN VARIETY STORMS AT THIS TIME. MAIN HAZARDS WITH STORMS ANTICIPATED AT THIS TIME THROUGH THE WEEK ARE LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN AND OCCASIONAL TO FREQUENT LIGHT STRIKES WITH THE STRONGEST STORMS. DAYTIME HIGHS WILL BE MOSTLY AROUND NORMAL FOR THE NEXT WEEK OR SO (GIVE OR TAKE A COUPLE OF DEGREES) WITH OVERNIGHT LOWS REMAINING SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL. MARINE... HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WILL KEEP THE WEATHER MOSTLY QUIET OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA COASTAL WATERS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. THE APPROACHING AFOREMENTIONED WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL STALL BY WEDNESDAY EVENING OVER NORTH CENTRAL FLORIDA. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR AN INCREASE IN SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY FROM LATE WEDNESDAY THROUGH LATE IN THE WEEKEND PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WATERS WITH OTHERWISE NORMAL DIURNAL PATTERN. WIND AND SEAS WILL REMAIN BELOW EXERCISE CAUTION AND/OR ADVISORY LEVELS THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. FIRE WEATHER... NO CONCERNS OTHER THAN PATCHY FOG MIXING WITH SMOKE ALONG ALLIGATOR ALLEY TONIGHT POTENTIALLY IMPACTING VISIBILITIES IN SOME AREAS OF THE ALLEY IN INLAND COLLIER COUNTY. 
SHOWERS AND STORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF OUR ALABAMA AND GEORGIA COUNTIES ARE EXPECTED TO DIMINISH OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. NEARBY SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL KEEP WINDS LIGHT AND VARIABLE, POTENTIALLY GOING CALM IN SOME AREAS OVERNIGHT. TONIGHT WILL BE HUMID WITH LOW DEW POINT DEPRESSIONS AND LOW TEMPERATURES AROUND 70. PATCHY FOG IS POSSIBLE IN THE HOURS AROUND SUNRISE. 
[THROUGH 00Z WEDNESDAY] STORMS CURRENTLY MOVING ACROSS OUR GEORGIA AND ALABAMA COUNTIES ARE EXPECTED TO DIMINISH AFTER SUNSET. THERE IS A CHANCE OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AGAIN TOMORROW AFTERNOON, PARTICULARLY AT DHN, ABY, AND VLD.  VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED AT ALL TERMINALS THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD, ALTHOUGH SOME PATCHY FOG WILL BE POSSIBLE LATE TONIGHT OR EARLY TUESDAY MORNING. 
FLAT UPPER RIDGE WILL REMAIN IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH THE WEEKEND. HIGH PRESSURE TO THE NORTH WILL PUSH A SLIGHTLY DRIER LOW-LEVEL AIRMASS INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE IN THE WEEK, WITH ONLY SLIGHT RAIN CHANCES FOR FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN WARM WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S/LOWER 90S AND LOWS IN THE UPPER 60S/LOWER 70S. 
MINIMUM RELATIVE HUMIDITY WILL REMAIN FAIRLY HIGH WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE DAYTIME HOURS. THERE IS NO POTENTIAL FOR RED FLAG CONDITIONS.

PATCHES OF LIGHT SHOWERS ARE PUSHING SLOWLY WEST/SOUTHWESTWARD LATE THIS EVENING...STRETCHING FROM THE NEARSHORE GULF WATERS TO THE ATLANTIC WATERS OFF THE MIDDLE KEYS. A POCKET OF CLOUDS IS THINNING NORTH OF THE ISLAND CHAIN...DEBRIS CLOUDS FROM HEAVIER CONVECTION ON THE SOUTHWESTERN COAST OF THE MAINLAND. WINDS ARE FROM THE NORTHEAST TO EAST AND ARE MODERATE. TEMPERATURES ALONG THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE IN THE LOWER 80S. THE POCKET OF CLOUDS JUST TO THE NORTH OF THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS SHOULD CONTINUE TO THIN OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS WHILE NEARBY LIGHT SHOWERS LINGER IN THAT AREA. THE LATE EVENING LOCAL SOUNDING SHOWS A BACKED PROFILE INTO THE MID LAYERS...BUT OVERALL SPEEDS HAVE DIMINISHED OVER THE PAST 12 TO 24 HOURS. THERE IS THE PROBABILITY OF SHOWERS OVERNIGHT...BUT THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE BRIEF AND RELATIVELY LIGHT. MAY ISSUE A LATE EVENING ZONE UPDATE TO CLEAN UP SOME TRANSITIONAL WORDING FOR THE SKY CONDITION AND INITIAL WIND SPEEDS IN A SHORT WHILE. BUT IN GENERAL...THE AFTERNOON ZONE FORECAST HAS THE EXPECTED CONDITIONS COVERED THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD. 
THERE WILL BE VERY LITTLE CHANGE ON THE UPCOMING MARINE FORECAST. WINDS WILL BE SLOWLY BUT STEADILY DIMINISHING ACROSS ALL WATERS SURROUNDING THE FLORIDA KEYS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. 
BRIEF MVFR CIGS ARE POSSIBLE AT THE MARATHON TERMINALS EARLY THIS EVENING AS DEBRIS CLOUDS FROM MAINLAND CONVECTION PUSH THROUGH. OTHERWISE...EXPECT VFR CONDITIONS AT THE KEY WEST AND MARATHON TERMINALS OVERNIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING. 
SHOWERS DIMINISHING ALONG GULF COAST...THEN MOSTLY DRY NIGHT EXPECTED. PATCHY FOG CANT BE RULED OUT WESTERN INTERIOR. NO CHANGES NEEDED TO GRIDS. 
AVIATION... VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL. EAST WIND WILL DIMINISH TO AOB 5 KTS TONIGHT...THEN INCREASE TO AROUND 10 KTS TUESDAY AFTERNOON.

SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR (PWAT OF 1.31 INCHES ON THE KTBW 00Z SOUNDING) AND A WEAK SEA BREEZE COLLISION HAS KEPT THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIMITED TODAY THAN WHAT WAS SEEN THE LAST FEW AFTERNOONS. ISOLATED CONVECTION IS STILL OCCURRING ALONG THE NATURE COAST AND NEAR THE SOUTHWEST FLORIDA COASTLINE...BUT THE REMAINING SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO DIE OUT OR MOVE OFFSHORE OVER THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO. ON TUESDAY...A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPROACHING NORTHERN FLORIDA WILL HELP INCREASE THE MOISTURE PROFILE FOR THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...WITH SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED OVER THE NATURE COAST AND AS FAR SOUTH AS THE INTERSTATE 4 CORRIDOR. DRIER AIR TO THE SOUTH WILL LIMIT SOUTHWEST FLORIDA TO A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS. OVERALL...FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK WITH NO MAJOR CHANGES PLANNED FOR THE EVENING UPDATE. 
VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO HOLD THROUGH AT LEAST EARLY TUESDAY AFTERNOON. SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ARE FORECAST TO DEVLOP OVER THE NATURE COAST AND TAMPA BAY AREA TUESDAY AFTERNOON...WITH KPIE...KTPA...AND KLAL THE MOST LIKELY TAF SITES IMPACTED BY BRIEF PERIODS OF REDUCED FLIGHT CATEGORIES. 
HIGH PRESSURE TO THE EAST OF FLORIDA WILL SHIFT SOUTH AS A WEAK FRONT MOVES INTO THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO AROUND MIDWEEK. HOWEVER...THE PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL REMAIN LIGHT...WITH WINDS AND SEAS KEEPING BELOW HEADLINE CRITERIA. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT MARINE HAZARD WILL BE FOR SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING ALONG THE COAST DURING THE AFTERNOONS AND MOVING INTO THE MARINE ZONES DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING HOURS EACH DAY. 
SEABREEZE MERGER WILL GRADUAL WEAKEN. WILL LIKELY REMOVE EVENING POPS WITH NEXT UPDATE. LOWS TONIGHT WILL BE IN UPPER 60S/LOWER 70S. UPPER RIDGE OVER THE SE WILL WEAKEN ON TUESDAY WITH A WESTERLY FLOW BECOMING ESTABLISHED AS SURFACE HIGH SHIFTS SOUTH. THIS WILL BRING AN INCREASE IN AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE EAST COAST. 
FOG MAY PRODUCE MVFR VSBYS AT GNV 08Z-12Z. HAVE VCTS FOR TAF SITES AFTER 17Z TUESDAY. 
STEERING FLOW WILL MEAN LATE DAY STORMS REACHING THE COASTAL WATERS THE NEXT FEW DAYS. 
UPDATE/REST OF TONIGHT...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS THAT RESULT FROM SEA BREEZE COLLISION STILL LOOK TO BE LIMITED TO AREAS WEST OF LAKE COUNTY TOWARD OR JUST WEST OF I-75. ADDITIONAL ISOLATED LIGHT SHOWERS OVER THE WATERS OF THE TREASURE COAST WILL ALSO DIMINISH INTO THIS EVENING AS ONSHORE FLOW WEAKENS. THEREFORE WILL KEEP RAIN CHANCES OUT OF THE FORECAST FOR TONIGHT. SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY CLEAR OVERNIGHT AND HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING ACROSS THE REGION WILL ALLOW FOR WINDS TO BECOME LIGHT. LOWS WILL BE NEAR TO A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL IN THE UPPER 60S TO AROUND 70 DEGREES MOST AREAS. TUESDAY...(PREVIOUS DISCUSSION) THE COLD FRONT WILL STALL OVER THE DEEP SOUTH AS THE SHORT WAVE LIFTS INTO CANADA. EVEN SO...IT WILL WEAKEN THE RIDGE ENOUGH FOR ITS H100-H85 ANTICYCLONE TO CLEAVE IN TWO WHILE FORCING ITS H85-H50 ANTICYCLONE TO RETREATS INTO THE GOMEX. THE RESULTING WEAKNESS IN THE LOW LVL WIND FIELD WILL ALLOW BOTH EAST AND WEST COAST SEA BREEZES TO DEVELOP BEFORE MIDDAY WITH COLLISION OCCURRING ALONG A LINE FROM LAKE GEORGE LAKE APOPKA INTO POLK CO.

CLUSTERS OF STORMS INITIATING ON BOTH THE SEA BREEZE BOUNDARY AND ALONG THE EASTERN EDGE OF A PASSING SHORTWAVE DISTURBANCE ACROSS WESTERN GEORGIA WILL FESTER...WITH NEW DOWNSTREAM CONVECTION OCCURRING ALONG OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES MOVING INTO A NEAR 90 HEATED AIR MASS THROUGH SUNSET. REGIONAL SHOWER AND STORM ACTIVITY WILL DIE OUT PAST 9 PM TONIGHT. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES WILL AID IN LAYING WINDS DOWN TO UNDER 5 KTS LATE TONIGHT WITH THE POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT OF A WEAK LAND BREEZE. MINIMUM TEMPERATURES AROUND 70F...WITH SMALL DEW POINT DEPRESSIONS... WILL ALLOW SHALLOW FOG TO REDEVELOP OVER MORE WIND PROTECTED INLAND COUNTIES SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT...ESPECIALLY IF THE AREA PICKED UP DECENT RAINFALL TODAY. 
[THROUGH 18Z TUESDAY] CONVECTION FIRING ALONG THE SEA BREEZE FRONT TO IMPACT THE TLH...ABY...AND VLD TERMINALS. WIDELY SCATTERED INLAND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY HAS DEVELOPED ALONG THE EASTERN EDGE OF A WEAK SHORTWAVE DISTURBANCE MOVING INTO A HEATED WESTERN GEORGIA AIR MASS IN THE UPPER 80S. STORM OUTFLOW BOUNDARY COLLISIONS/INTERACTIONS MAY KEEP LATE AFTERNOON STORMS ALIVE AN HOUR OR TWO PAST SUNSET. THE ONLY INLAND HUB WITH A LOW CHANCE OF CONVECTION WILL BE DHN AS IT LIES TO THE WEST OF THE SOUTHERN END OF THIS SHORTWAVE-INDUCED CONVECTION. LOSS OF HEATING WILL HAVE THUNDERSTORMS QUICKLY DISSIPATING THROUGH 8 OR 9 PM. REGIONAL HIGH PRESSURE WILL AID IN DECOUPLING MID-LATE EVENING WINDS...A CHANCE FOR NEAR SUNRISE SHALLOW FOG DEVELOPMENT OVER MORE INTERIOR HUBS TLH AND VLD WHERE GROUND MOISTURE RESIDES FROM TODAY`S RAIN. A WEAK BACKGROUND WIND WILL AGAIN INCREASE THE ODDS OF SCATTERED STORM DEVELOPMENT TOMORROW (OR ONCE MID 80S ARE MET) EITHER ALONG THE SEA BREEZE BOUNDARY AND/OR IN THE VICINITY OF ABY AND VLD UPON TODAY`S OLD GUST FRONT BOUNDARIES. 
WEST TO NORTHWEST FLOW WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. A WEAK FRONT WILL APPROACH THE WATERS LATE WEDNESDAY, WITH A MODEST INCREASE IN WESTERLY WINDS EXPECTED OVER THE EASTERN WATERS. THEREAFTER, LIGHT OFFSHORE FLOW WILL DEVELOP FOR THE END OF THE WEEK, MODULATED BY THE SEABREEZE NEAR THE COAST EACH AFTERNOON. 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON AREA RIVERS AND STREAMS. 
TONIGHT...

THIS MAY HAVE SOME EFFECT ON THE LOCAL LOW LEVEL WIND FIELD...BUT DOESN`T APPEAR TO INFLUENCE OVERALL RAIN CHANCES DRAMATICALLY. OVERALL THE AREA WILL SEE SCATTERED AFTERNOON AND EVENING SHOWERS AND STORMS AS MOISTURE INCREASES WITH STALLING FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND TROUGH ALOFT PROVIDES SOME ADDITIONAL INSTABILITY. WEST-NORTHWEST STEERING FLOW WILL FOCUS MORE AFTERNOON CONVECTION BACK TO THE EAST COAST. OFFSHORE FLOW WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO DELAY THE ONSET/INLAND MOVEMENT OF THE EAST COAST SEA BREEZE...BUT NOT PREVENT IT ALTOGETHER. LATER SEABREEZE WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO WARM INTO THE UPPER 80S AND LOW 90S...EVEN AT THE COAST. THE WEEKEND...FRONTAL BOUNDARY WASHES OUT TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEK AS SURFACE HIGH MOVES OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST. THIS WILL PLACE THE PENINSULA BACK IN PREVAILING ONSHORE FLOW AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS BACK OVERHEAD WITH SOME MID LEVEL DRYING TRENDS INDICATED. PATTERN LOOKS TO RETURN TO ONSHORE MOVING ATLANTIC SHOWERS ALONG THE COAST WITH AFTERNOON CONVECTION ONCE AGAIN FOCUSED OVER THE INTERIOR AND WEST FLORIDA.

TONIGHT-TUESDAY...RIDGE AXIS OVER THE GOMEX/W ATLC HAS WILL WEAKEN OVERNIGHT AND DRIFT INTO THE CENTRAL PENINSULA AS A COLD PRESSES INTO THE DEEP SOUTH. WEAK PGRAD WILL CONTINUE...RESULTING IN SFC/BNDRY LYR WINDS SHIFTING FROM THE CURRENT LIGHT TO GENTLE ERLY BREEZE TO A LIGHT SRLY BREEZE OVERNIGHT...S/SE FROM SEBASTIAN INLET SWD...S/SW NORTH OF THE INLET. THE WEAK PGRAD ALSO WILL ALLOW THE EAST COAST SEA BREEZE TO DVLP BY LATE MON MRNG WITH NEARSHORE WINDS BCMG A LIGHT TO GENTLE E/SE BREEZE. A NERLY BACKGROUND SWELL WILL KEEP SEAS IN THE 2-3FT RANGE NEARSHORE AND 3-4FT RANGE OFFSHORE. SLGT CHC OF OFFSHORE MOVING TSRAS FROM CAPE CANAVERAL NWD TUE AFTN. TUE NIGHT-THU...LOW-LEVEL RIDGE AXIS CONTINUES SOUTH OF THE REGION AS FRONTAL BOUNDARY SAGS DOWN THE EASTERN SEABOARD AND EVENTUALLY WASHES OUT OVER THE REGION WED AND THURS. PREVAILING SOUTHWEST WINDS AROUND 10KTS WITH SOME BACKING EAST-SOUTHEAST IN THE AFTERNOONS NEAR THE COAST WITH THE SEABREEZE. SEAS GENERALLY 2-3FT OCCASIONALLY UP TO 4FT WELL OFFSHORE. THE MAIN MARINER WEATHER HAZARD WILL BE OFFSHORE MOVING AFTERNOON/EVENING STORMS WHICH SHOULD START IN THE NORTH TUE AND THEN AFFECT THE REST OF THE COAST WED/THU. FRI-SAT...FRONTAL BOUNDARY WASHES OUT ACROSS THE REGION LATE WEEK WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN FROM THE NORTH INTO NEXT WEEKEND. WINDS WILL BE FAIRLY LIGHT AND VARIABLE ON FRIDAY BEFORE SEA BREEZE CIRCULATION SETS UP IN THE AFTERNOON WITH STRONGER EAST-NORTHEAST WINDS ARRIVING INTO SAT AS GRADIENT TIGHTENS ON SOUTH SIDE OF ATLANTIC SURFACE HIGH. 
19Z WATER VAPOR AND H4 RAP ANALYSIS SHOWS YET ANOTHER IN A SERIES OF STRONG LONGWAVE TROUGH ABOUT TO PIVOT OUT OF THE SOUTHWESTERN STATES. THE LAST TROUGH IS JUST NOW BEGINNING TO EXIT THE UPPER MIDWEST...BUT HERE COMES THE NEXT ONE CROSSING INTO THE INTER- MOUNTAIN WEST. THANKFULLY FOR OUR LOCAL AREA...THIS INCLEMENT WEATHER WILL REMAIN WELL TO OUR NORTHWEST...WHILE WE REMAIN UNDER THE CONTROL OF WEAK RIDGING ALOFT INTO TUESDAY. AT THE SURFACE...ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE IS RIDGING BACK INTO THE NORTHERN FLORIDA PENINSULA THIS AFTERNOON AND WILL CONTINUE TO BOTH SETTLE SLOWLY SOUTHWARD AND WEAKEN DURING THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS. THE POSITION OF THE RIDGE IS RESULTING IN A LIGHT EASTERLY FLOW FOR THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA...AND A LIGHT AND VARIABLE FLOW TO THE NORTH OF THE TAMPA BAY AREA. ALTHOUGH EASTERLY FLOW IS GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE WEST COAST SEA BREEZE...TODAY IS DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS DAYS WITH A SUBSTANTIAL LAYER OF DRY/HOSTILE AIR TOWARD DEEP CONVECTION IN THE MID LEVELS. CAN NOT RULE OUT A FEW ISOLATED STORMS THAT WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE THIS DRIER COLUMN TO THE SOUTH OF THE I-4 CORRIDOR...BUT THEY WILL BE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. MOISTURE PROFILES ARE SLIGHTLY BETTER OVER OUR FAR NORTHERN AREAS...AND ACTUALLY STARTING TO SEE SOME STORMS DEVELOP UP TOWARD PERRY/CROSS CITY. THINK BETTER CHANCES FOR A FEW EVENING STORMS FOR OUR AREA WILL BE UP TOWARD CITRUS/LEVY/NORTHERN SUMTER COUNTY...AS THE SEA-BREEZE SLOWLY MIGRATES INLAND. 
SCT EVENING STORMS DECAY QUICKLY WITH THE LOSS OF DIURNAL HEATING LATER THIS EVENING...SETTING UP A GENERALLY DRY AND SEASONABLY WARM MID MAY OVERNIGHT. OVERNIGHT LOWS GENERALLY IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S FOR MOST SPOTS...ALTHOUGH NORMALLY WARMER LOCATIONS SUCH AS SOUTHERN PINELLAS COUNTY AND THE ISLANDS OF CHARLOTTE HARBOR WILL STAY EVEN WARMER WITH DEVELOPING LAND BREEZE FLOW OFF THE BAYS. FOR TUESDAY...UPPER RIDGE IS STILL IN PLACE...BUT WILL BEGIN TO WEAKEN WITH HEIGHTS SLOWLY DROPPING THROUGH THE DAY. AT THE SURFACE THE RIDGE AXIS WILL SETTLE DOWN INTO THE CENTRAL OR EVEN SOUTH-CENTRAL FL PENINSULA. THIS MOTION WILL BE FORCED BY THE SLOW APPROACH OF A WEAK FRONT FROM THE NORTH. THIS FRONT MAY REACH AS FAR SOUTH AS THE I-10 CORRIDOR BEFORE TUESDAY IS OVER. THE SYNOPTIC FLOW SOUTH OF THIS FRONT WILL FINALLY SHIFT TO A MORE WESTERLY DIRECTION ACROSS A LARGE PORTION OF OUR AREA. THE WESTERLY FLOW WILL CERTAINLY BE WEAKER DOWN TOWARD FORT MYERS...BUT SHOULD STILL BE PRESENT. THE WEST FLOW WILL ACT TO STEADILY PROGRESS THE SEA BREEZE INLAND...ESPECIALLY FOR THE NATURE COAST. BETTER MOISTURE PROFILES...AND ADDED FOCUS ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPROACHING SYNOPTIC BOUNDARY SHOULD KEEP THE BEST CHANCES FOR DIURNAL CONVECTION ALONG AND NORTH OF THE I-4 CORRIDOR. WILL HAVE 40-50% POPS FOR THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA...AND GENERALLY 20-30% (AT BEST) FURTHER SOUTH. HOWEVER...AS MENTIONED...AS THE SEA-BREEZE MOVES INLAND...RAIN CHANCES WILL DECREASE NEAR THE COAST (EVEN FOR THE NATURE COAST) AS THE AFTERNOON PROGRESSES. BY THE EVENING HOURS...MUCH OF THE STORM ACTIVITY SHOULD BE WELL INLAND. HIGH TEMPERATURES THURSDAY REACH THE MIDDLE 80S AT THE BEACHES WITH UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S ALONG THE I-75 CORRIDOR AND FURTHER INLAND. 
WED-FRI: AN UPPER LOW ROTATES OVER EASTERN CANADA WITH A TROUGH THAT PIVOTS FROM THE UPPER MID-WEST TO THE EASTERN SEA BOARD...FLATTENING AND SHIFTING AN UPPER RIDGE OVER THE GULF BACK TO THE WEST. AT THE SURFACE INITIALLY...HIGH PRESSURE SPRAWLS ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WITH A FRONT THAT ARCS FROM THE SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY SOUTH ALONG THE EASTERN U.S. COAST THEN BACK WEST THROUGH THE GULF COASTAL STATES...AND ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE RIDGES ACROSS SOUTHERN FL INTO THE GULF. WITH TIME...THE HIGH PRESSURE SAGS SOUTH AS IT BUILDS EAST WITH THE FRONT PUSHING EAST AND SOUTH...WITH THE SOUTHERN/WESTERN END DROPPING DOWN ALONG THE GULF COAST AND THROUGH NORTHERN FL. THE ATLANTIC RIDGE MEANDERS OVER OR OFF SOUTHERN FL. SAT-MON: A PACIFIC UPPER LOW MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT BASIN AND OUT OVER THE PLAINS AS AN OPEN WAVE WITH UPPER RIDGING BUILDING BACK OVER THE GULF THEN SLIDING ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST U.S. TO THE ATLANTIC. THE SURFACE HIGH...BY NOW OVER THE UPPER MID-WEST AND UPPER GREAT LAKES...TRACKS ACROSS THE MID-ATLANTIC STATES THEN OFFSHORE. AS IT DOES IT BRIDGES THE DECAYING FRONT IN THE NORTHERN GULF AND NORTHERN FL AND BUILDS IN ACROSS FL. THE CURRENT FORECAST PHILOSOPHY REMAINS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PAST FEW DAYS. THE ATMOSPHERE CONTINUES WITH AMPLE MOISTURE FOR ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS. A WESTERLY FLOW PATTERN SETS UP WED AND CONTINUES THROUGH FRI...WITH A FEW MORNING SHOWERS OR STORMS POSSIBLE ON THE GULF THEN MORE COVERAGE IN THE AFTERNOONS WITH THE HIGHEST INLAND. FOR THE WEEKEND THE PATTERN GOES BACK TO EAST AND SOUTHEAST...AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE NORTH...WITH THE GREATEST SHOWER/STORM COVERAGE IN THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING ON THE WEST COAST...A RESULT OF SEA BREEZE CIRCULATIONS. TEMPERATURES WILL RUN ABOVE NORMAL...ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE A SLIGHT DIP LATE IN THE PERIOD. 
VFR CONDITIONS PREVAILING ACROSS WEST-CENTRAL AND SOUTHWEST FLORIDA THIS AFTERNOON. JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED STORM FOR ANY OF THE TERMINALS THROUGH 00Z...HOWEVER MOST AREAS WILL REMAIN DRY. VFR CONDITIONS GENERALLY PREVAIL FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE OVERNIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING. TOWARD THE END OF THE TAF PERIOD (18Z)...A FEW SHOWERS SHOULD START TO FORM ALONG THE SEA- BREEZE IN THE VICINITY OF KTPA/KPIE...AND MAY NEED MENTION IN UPCOMING TAF PACKAGES. 
HIGH PRESSURE THAT HAS BEEN OVER THE EASTERN SEABOARD SHIFTS SOUTHWARD AS A WEAK FRONTAL SYSTEM APPROACHES FROM THE NORTH ON TUESDAY. THIS INTERACTION WILL ALLOW FOR THE WINDS TO SHIFT TO A MORE WEST OR NORTHWEST DIRECTION THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. THE WESTERLY FLOW WILL HELP KEEP THE BEST CHANCES FOR STORMS INLAND THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. WINDS AND SEAS REMAIN BELOW HEADLINE CRITERIA. 
NO SIGNIFICANT FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES WILL REMAIN ABOVE CRITICAL LEVELS. THE THUNDERSTORM PATTERN THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL FAVOR THE SEA-BREEZE MOVING INLAND BEYOND THE I-75 CORRIDOR...AND THEREFORE THE HIGHEST RAIN CHANCES WILL BE AWAY FROM THE COAST AND PROGRESSING INLAND THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. FOG IMPACT...NO SIGNIFICANT FOG IS EXPECTED FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS...BUT LATE NIGHT PATCHY GROUND FOG COULD DEVELOP IN AREAS THAT SEE RAIN DURING THE EVENING HOURS. 
RIDGE IN CONTROL ACROSS THE REGION. UPR AIR ANALYSIS SHOWS STRONG LOW AND MID LEVEL RIDGE JUST UP AND DOWN THE STATE WITH CWA ON THE SOUTH AND SE END OF THAT FEATURE. WATER VAPOR LOOP SHOWS SLIGHTLY DRIER AND MORE STABLE AIRMASS IMPINGING ON THE SE COAST OF FLORIDA FROM THE ATLANTIC ON THE SOUTHEASTERN PERYPHERY OF THE LOW AND MID LEVEL RIDGE. THERMODYNAMIC PROFILES AT LOW LEVELS ARE NOT IMPRESSIVE AT ALL IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE RIDGE WITH H9 BASED INVERSION PRESENT AND MID LEVELS WARMER THAN NORMAL. THIS COMBINED WITH STORM MOTION VECTOR FROM THE ENE AROUND 10 KNOTS WILL MEAN ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING ACROSS THE INTERIOR AND TOWARDS THE SW FLORIDA COAST WITH STORMS OF THE GARDEN VARIETY TYPE. MOST STORM ACTIVITY WILL LIKELY BE JUST AROUND OR EAST OF THE NAPLES AREA WHERE STRONGEST SEA BREEZE CONVERGENCE IS ANTICIPATED. MAIN CONCERN WILL BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND LIGHTNING STRIKES AS STORM MOTION WILL SLOW DOWN ALONG C-BRZ FRONT. FOR TUESDAY SIMILAR PATTERN IS ANTICIPATED TO PREVAIL WITH MOST CONVECTION ACROSS INTERIOR AND SOUTHWEST FLORIDA COAST PARTICULARLY EAST AND SOUTH OF NAPLES AS STORM VECTOR MOTION GAINS A MORE NORTHERLY COMPONENT. THE REAL CHANGE COMES WEDNESDAY AS A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY ENTERS NORTHERN FLORIDA AND LOW AND MID LEVEL RIDGE WEAKENS CONSIDERABLY. ADDITIONALLY, PRECIPITABLE WATER JUMPS BACK UP TO WELL ABOVE NORMAL LEVELS AND WITH THAT THE CONSENSUS OF THE GUIDANCE INCREASES POPS TO NEARLY 50-60% RANGE PARTICULARLY ACROSS INTERIOR PORTIONS OF SOUTH FLORIDA WITH PERIPHERAL CONVECTION AND ABOUT EQUAL CHANCES TOWARDS BOTH EAST AND WEST COASTS METRO AREAS. BUT AGAIN BEST CHANCES REMAIN INLAND. FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY LINGERING/WEAKENING FRONT ACROSS THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE ALONG WITH LIGHT WESTERLY STORM MOTION FAVORS PATTERN AGAIN FOR SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND STORMS ACROSS THE INTERIOR WITH PERIPHERAL SCATTERED ACTIVITY FAVORING EAST COAST ON THURSDAY BUT JUST ABOUT THE SAME ON BOTH WEST AND EAST COAST METRO AREAS ON FRIDAY AS STORM MOTION VECTOR BECOMES WEAKER. BY THE WEEKEND AND EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ONCE AGAIN TO THE NORTH WITH EASTERLY STORM MOTION FAVORING INTERIOR AND WEST COAST SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION. NO ELEMENTS INDICATING MUCH MORE THAN GARDEN VARIETY STORMS AT THIS TIME. MAIN HAZARDS WITH STORMS ANTICIPATED AT THIS TIME THROUGH THE WEEK ARE LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN AND OCCASIONAL TO FREQUENT LIGHT STRIKES WITH THE STRONGEST STORMS. DAYTIME HIGHS WILL BE MOSTLY AROUND NORMAL FOR THE NEXT WEEK OR SO (GIVE OR TAKE A COUPLE OF DEGREES) WITH OVERNIGHT LOWS REMAINING SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL. 
NO CONCERNS OTHER THAN PATCHY FOG MIXING WITH SMOKE ALONG ALLIGATOR ALLEY TONIGHT POTENTIALLY IMPACTING VISIBILITIES IN SOME AREAS OF THE ALLEY IN INLAND COLLIER COUNTY. 
A MOSTLY FAIR AND FINE WEATHER PATTERN HAS PREVAILED TODAY ACROSS FLORIDA KEYS COASTAL WATERS...WITH ONLY A FEW SHOWERS DETECTED BY LOCAL RADARS...MAINLY THIS MORNING. A SKIMPY...STUNTED CLOUD LINE WITH CUMULUS PATHETICUS HAS PERSISTED IN THE VICINITY OF THE LOWER FLORIDA KEYS DURING THE LAST FEW HOURS...WITH PERHAPS A FEW SHORT- LIVED CEILING EPISODES. THE LOCAL ATMOSPHERE IS ONLY WEAKLY UNSTABLE...WITH CONSIDERABLE DRY AIR ALOFT. A FEW SHOWERS FINALLY ARE DEVELOPING ALONG SEA/BAY BREEZES OVER MAINLAND MONROE COUNTY...AND THESE MAY AFFECT PORTIONS OF THE GULF ZONES LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING...WITH AN OUTSIDE CHANCE OF AFFECTING LOWER KEYS COMMUNITIES. CURRENTLY...AIR TEMPERATURES IN KEYS COMMUNITIES RANGE FROM 85-90F...DEPENDING ON INSOLATION. A MODERATE EAST BREEZE PERSISTS...WITH HIGHER WIND SPEEDS OVER THE STRAITS. WE HAVE ADJUSTED FORECASTS TO REDUCE RAIN CHANCES DURING THE FIRST FEW PERIODS...AND REMOVE THUNDER THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. EVEN THOUGH THE LARGE-SCALE RIDGE LIKELY WILL BREAK DOWN TEMPORARILY THROUGH MID-WEEK. DRY AIR ALOFT AND A DEARTH OF FORCING FOR ASCENT ON ANY SCALE SHOULD PRECLUDE DEEP...MOIST CONVECTION...AT LEAST THROUGH FRIDAY...EVEN THOUGH ISOLATED SHALLOW AND SHORT-LIVED SHOWERS WILL BE A POSSIBILITY EACH DAY AND NIGHT. BY THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND...THE HIGH WILL BE BUILDING NORTH OF THE KEYS ONCE AGAIN...RESULTING IN FRESHENING EASTERLY BREEZES...AND PERHAPS A TENDENCY TOWARD LATE NIGHT-EARLY MORNING SHOWERS/STORMS. 
A HIGH PRESSURE CELL OVER THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC AND FLORIDA PENINSULA WILL WEAKEN GRADUALLY AS IT SETTLES SOUTHWARD TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. AS A RESULT...LOCAL BREEZES WILL SLACKEN TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. THE HIGH WILL BEGIN TO BUILD AGAIN BY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...RESULTING IN FRESHENING EAST BREEZES ACROSS FLORIDA KEYS COASTAL WATERS ONCE AGAIN. 
EAST NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS BETWEEN 10 AND 15 KNOTS WILL CONTINUE THIS AFTERNOON...SLIGHTLY DECREASING AT THE KEY WEST AND MARATHON TERMINALS TONIGHT. CLOUD COVERAGE WILL ALSO DECREASE THIS AFTERNOON TO A FEW AT AROUND 025. 
TONIGHT...ATLC COAST SEA BREEZE PROGRESSING INLAND THROUGH THE I-95 CORRIDOR/ST JOHNS RIVER BASIN WITH JUST A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS/SPRINKLES...BUT STILL EXPECT OVERALL ACTIVITY TO PEAK ACROSS INLD SE GA/SUWANNEE RIVER VALLEY OF NORTH FLORIDA WHERE SCATTERED SHOWERS/STORMS EXPECTED WITH SLOW MOVEMENT DUE TO WEAK STEERING FLOW. HAVE KEPT RAIN CHANCES MAINLY IN THE 40-60% RANGE THROUGH SUNSET...THEN A RAPID DECREASE TO 10% OR LESS AFTER MIDNIGHT. A FEW STORMS OVER INLAND AREAS COULD BECOME BRIEFLY STRONG WITH LIGHTNING/GUSTY WINDS/SMALL HAIL/HEAVY RAINFALL BUT SEVERE WEATHER IS NOT EXPECTED. PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES WILL LINGER OVERNIGHT WITH SOME MID/UPPER LEVEL CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDS AND LOWS NEAR 70 DEGREES. SOME PATCHY/SHALLOW GROUND FOG OVER INLAND AREAS WITH VSBYS IN THE 3-5 MILE RANGE WILL BE POSSIBLE NEAR SUNRISE BUT NOT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO MENTION IN ZFP/GRIDS. 
REMAINS IN THE AREA ON FRIDAY WITH A REINFORCING RIDGE-WEDGE TRYING TO BUILD IN ON SATURDAY. BY SUNDAY THAT WEDGE IS WELL ESTABLISHED WITH SHOWERS COMING IN FROM OFF THE ATLANTIC. THE RIDGE MOVES OFFSHORE BY MONDAY WITH A COASTAL TROUGH COMING ASHORE. OVERALL...BEST CHANCE OF RAIN LOOKS TO BE TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY WITH WIDELY SCATTERED PRECIPITATION IN MOST AREAS LATER IN THE WEEK AND NEXT WEEKEND. 
VFR CONDS WILL PREVAIL...A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS/SPRINKLES WILL BE POSSIBLE AS THE ATLC COAST SEA BREEZE FRONT PUSHES WEST PAST KJAX/KVQQ...THEN JUST THE LINGERING SHOT AT A SHOWER OR POSSIBLY A TSTM AT KGNV THROUGH THE AFTN/EVE HOURS. VFR FAIR SKIES OVERNIGHT WITH SCATTERED DEBRIS CLOUDS AT TIMES AND POSSIBLE 4-5SM FOG AT KGNV/KVQQ TOWARDS MORNING. SLIGHTLY HIGHER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS ON TUE AFTERNOON...SO HAVE ADDED VCSH AT ALL TAF SITES FOR AFTER 16Z TO TREND IN THAT DIRECTION. 
WEAK HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE JUST NORTH OF THE WATERS WILL BE REPLACED BY WEAK TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE THROUGH THE WEEK...BUT OVERALL DAYTIME SOUTHEASTERLY SEA BREEZE AT 10-15 KNOTS WILL BECOME SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST AT 10-15 KNOTS AT NIGHT. SEAS WILL GENERALLY REMAIN IN THE 2-4 FT RANGE AND DO NOT EXPECT HEADLINES. RIP CURRENTS: LOW TO MODERATE RISK OF RIPS WILL LINGER INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. 
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD. EASTERLY WINDS WILL REMAIN BETWEEN 10 TO 15 KNOTS THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS THE EAST COAST TERMINALS. THESE WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO DIMINISH THIS EVENING. AT KAPF, A SEABREEZE WILL DEVELOP LATER THIS AFTERNOON SHIFTING THE WINDS AROUND TO THE WEST AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS. THESE WINDS WILL ALSO DIMINISH THIS EVENING. 
UPDATE... NO MAJOR CHANGES NEEDED TO BE MADE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. THE 12Z MIAMI SOUNDING SHOWED THAT A DRIER AND MORE STABLE AIR MASS HAS MOVED INTO THE REGION. THIS IS DUE TO THE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE EASTERN SEABOARD. WITH THE EASTERLY FLOW, THE ATLANTIC SEABREEZE WILL PUSH INLAND WHILE THE GULF COAST SEA BREEZE STRUGGLES TO MOVE VERY FAR INLAND. THE BEST CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE LATER THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS INTERIOR AND WEST COAST SECTIONS. PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 725 AM EDT MON MAY 18 2015/ AVIATION... VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD. EASTERLY WINDS WILL INCREASE TO 10 TO 15 KNOTS BY THE MIDDLE OF THE MORNING. DRIER AIR WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE INTO THE REGION TODAY, HOWEVER A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A THUNDERSTORM CANNOT BE RULED OUT AFTER 18Z. AT KAPF, A GULF COAST SEA BREEZE WILL DEVELOP LATER THIS AFTERNOON WHICH WILL SHIFT THE WINDS TO A WESTERLY DIRECTION. THIS SEA BREEZE WILL DIMINISH LATER THIS EVENING. PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 403 AM EDT MON MAY 18 2015/ DISCUSSION... TODAY WILL BEGIN WITH A 500MB RIDGE OVER THE EAST COAST OF THE US AND A SFC HIGH OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. THE SFC HIGH WILL KEEP THE WIND GENERALLY OUT OF THE EAST ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA. WITH DAYTIME HEATING, THE SEA BREEZES WILL KICK IN. WITH THE EAST FLOW, THE ATLANTIC BREEZE WILL DOMINATE AND PUSH ACROSS THE INTERIOR, WHILE THE GULF BREEZE STRUGGLES TO MOVE VERY FAR INLAND AT ALL. THEY LOOK TO MEET JUST TO THE EAST OF THE NAPLES METRO AREA. THIS GENERAL VICINITY LOOKS TO HAVE THE BEST CHANCES OF CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON, ALTHOUGH IT CAN STILL FORM ANYWHERE OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AS THE ATLANTIC BREEZE MOVES INLAND. WITH A FAIRLY STRONG HIGH ALOFT, 500MB HEIGHTS AT AROUND 590DM, 3-6KM LAPSE RATES OF AROUND 6 C/KM, NCAPE OF AROUND .12, PWATS OF AROUND 1.75 INCHES, AND THE ONLY REAL FORCING, BESIDES DAYTIME HEATING, ARE THE SEA BREEZE FRONTS, THE MAIN THREAT WILL BE GENERAL THUNDERSTORMS. HOWEVER, AS WITH MOST SOUTH FLORIDA THUNDERSTORM, THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED STRONG THUNDERSTORM, ESPECIALLY IN THE VICINITY OF WHERE THE SEA BREEZES MEET. THIS SAME PATTERN REPEATS TOMORROW. THEN, FOR WEDNESDAY, THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL BE FLATTENED OUT AND THE SFC HIGH WILL HAVE WEAKENED. THIS IS AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION, THEN TO THE NORTHEAST. THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO NORTH FLORIDA, THEN STALL SOMEWHERE OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE WIND WILL BECOME LIGHTER ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA, WITH THE RIDGING WEAKENING. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR THE SEA BREEZES TO MEET MORE IN THE INTERIOR. ALSO, WITH THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE FLATTENED, THE CONVECTION WILL BE ABLE TO BECOME BETTER DEVELOPED. THE FRONT WILL SLOWLY DRIFT SOUTH AND BECOME MORE AND MORE DIFFUSE THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THIS WILL ALLOW THE CONTINUATION OF DIURNAL CONVECTION THROUGH THE WEEKEND. BY THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK, HIGH PRESSURE WILL ONCE AGAIN STRENGTHEN OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AND A 500MB RIDGE WILL ALSO BUILD ONCE AGAIN, BRINGING US BACK INTO OUR CURRENT PATTERN, WITH AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE CWA, POSSIBLY EVEN JUST ALONG THE GULF COAST. AVIATION... VFR CONDITIONS FORECAST TO PREVAIL THROUGH THE TAF PERIOD. EASTERLY WINDS 5-10 KNOTS OVERNIGHT WILL INCREASE TO 10 KNOTS FOR THE EAST COAST TAF SITES AFTER 14Z...AND THEN TO AROUND 12 KNOTS BY 18Z. A FEW COASTAL SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE IN THE MORNING...BUT DRIER AIR WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION. FOR KAPF...GULF COAST SEA BREEZE FORECAST TO DEVELOP BETWEEN 19-21Z. A FEW SHOWERS OR STORMS MAY FORM ALONG THE SEA BREEZE...BUT PROBABILITY TOO LOW TO MENTION ATTM. MARINE... HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WILL KEEP THE WEATHER MOSTLY QUIET OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA COASTAL WATERS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT WILL STALL BY WEDNESDAY EVENING OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR AN INCREASE IN SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY FROM WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND. BY MONDAY, THE AREA WILL RETURN TO A SIMILAR PATTERN AS WE ARE UNDER NOW. CURRENTLY EXPECTING A GRADUAL INCREASE IN WAVE HEIGHTS UP TO AROUND 3 FEET BY THE WEEKEND. 
AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING SHOWS A DEEP ANTICYCLONE IN THE PROCESS OF WEAKENING OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. THE ASSOCIATED SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CELL HAS WEAKENED CONSIDERABLY DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS AS IT SHIFTED SOUTHWARD. LOCAL BREEZES HAVE SLACKENED SOME...BUT WILL BE COMING DOWN FURTHER DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS. THE KEY WEST MORNING RAWINSONDE OBSERVATION INDICATED ONLY WEAK CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY...WITH SOME LOW-LEVEL CONVECTIVE INHIBITION AND DRY AIR AS WELL. ALTHOUGH LOW-LEVEL WIND FLOW HAS FACILITATED DEVELOPMENT OF CLOUD LINES ACROSS THE MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS. THE CUMULUS HAVE EXHIBITED STUNTED GROWTH...AND ANY CEILINGS HAVE BEEN LOCALIZED AND FLEETING. LOCAL DOPPLER RADAR SCANS SHOW ISOLATED SHOWERS...MOSTLY AROUND THE DRY TORTUGAS WHERE THERE SEEMS TO BE A WEAK MESOSCALE CONVERGENCE ZONE IN THE EASTERLIES. BOTH DIGITAL AND DERIVED FORECASTS HAVE BEEN UPDATED TO REDUCE RAIN CHANCES. SHOWER COVERAGE WILL BE HIGHER OVER SOME OF THE GULF ZONES LATER AS CELLS FORMING OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA MOVE WESTWARD. WE KEPT ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS IN THE FORECAST FOR THIS AFTERNOON FROM HAWK CHANNEL NORTHWARD. HOWEVER...THE OBSERVED CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY IS NOT FAVORABLE FOR STRONG CUMULUS UPDRAFTS...SO ANY STORMS SHOULD BE FAIRLY WEAK AND SHORT-LIVED. 
A HIGH PRESSURE CELL OVER THE WESTERN SUBTROPICAL NORTH ATLANTIC THIS AFTERNOON WILL WEAKEN GRADUALLY AS IT MOVES SOUTHWARD THROUGH TONIGHT. THE HIGH THEN WILL SPLIT OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. MODERATE BREEZES THIS AFTERNOON WILL SLACKEN FURTHER TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...BECOMING LIGHT TO GENTLE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. 
WINDS WILL BE 10 KNOTS OR LESS FROM EAST NORTHEAST TO EAST FOR KEY WEST AND MARATHON. PATCHES OF CLOUDS ARE MOVING ACROSS THE ISLANDS THIS MORNING AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FROM TIME TO TIME THIS AFTERNOON...AT HEIGHTS BETWEEN 025 AND 035 THAT COULD BRING BRIEF MVFR CONDITIONS THROUGH EARLY THIS EVENING TO EYW. 
IN THIS DATE IN KEY WEST WEATHER HISTORY...IN 1881...THE DAILY RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURE OF 92F WAS RECORDED. TEMPERATURE RECORDS AT KEY WEST DATE BACK TO 1872. 
NO MAJOR CHANGES NEEDED TO BE MADE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. THE 12Z MIAMI SOUNDING SHOWED THAT A DRIER AND MORE STABLE AIR MASS HAS MOVED INTO THE REGION. THIS IS DUE TO THE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE EASTERN SEABOARD. WITH THE EASTERLY FLOW, THE ATLANTIC SEABREEZE WILL PUSH INLAND WHILE THE GULF COAST SEA BREEZE STRUGGLES TO MOVE VERY FAR INLAND. THE BEST CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE LATER THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS INTERIOR AND WEST COAST SECTIONS. 
AVIATION... VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD. EASTERLY WINDS WILL INCREASE TO 10 TO 15 KNOTS BY THE MIDDLE OF THE MORNING. DRIER AIR WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE INTO THE REGION TODAY, HOWEVER A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A THUNDERSTORM CANNOT BE RULED OUT AFTER 18Z. AT KAPF, A GULF COAST SEA BREEZE WILL DEVELOP LATER THIS AFTERNOON WHICH WILL SHIFT THE WINDS TO A WESTERLY DIRECTION. THIS SEA BREEZE WILL DIMINISH LATER THIS EVENING. PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 403 AM EDT MON MAY 18 2015/ DISCUSSION... TODAY WILL BEGIN WITH A 500MB RIDGE OVER THE EAST COAST OF THE US AND A SFC HIGH OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. THE SFC HIGH WILL KEEP THE WIND GENERALLY OUT OF THE EAST ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA. WITH DAYTIME HEATING, THE SEA BREEZES WILL KICK IN. WITH THE EAST FLOW, THE ATLANTIC BREEZE WILL DOMINATE AND PUSH ACROSS THE INTERIOR, WHILE THE GULF BREEZE STRUGGLES TO MOVE VERY FAR INLAND AT ALL. THEY LOOK TO MEET JUST TO THE EAST OF THE NAPLES METRO AREA. THIS GENERAL VICINITY LOOKS TO HAVE THE BEST CHANCES OF CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON, ALTHOUGH IT CAN STILL FORM ANYWHERE OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AS THE ATLANTIC BREEZE MOVES INLAND. WITH A FAIRLY STRONG HIGH ALOFT, 500MB HEIGHTS AT AROUND 590DM, 3-6KM LAPSE RATES OF AROUND 6 C/KM, NCAPE OF AROUND .12, PWATS OF AROUND 1.75 INCHES, AND THE ONLY REAL FORCING, BESIDES DAYTIME HEATING, ARE THE SEA BREEZE FRONTS, THE MAIN THREAT WILL BE GENERAL THUNDERSTORMS. HOWEVER, AS WITH MOST SOUTH FLORIDA THUNDERSTORM, THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED STRONG THUNDERSTORM, ESPECIALLY IN THE VICINITY OF WHERE THE SEA BREEZES MEET. THIS SAME PATTERN REPEATS TOMORROW. THEN, FOR WEDNESDAY, THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL BE FLATTENED OUT AND THE SFC HIGH WILL HAVE WEAKENED. THIS IS AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION, THEN TO THE NORTHEAST. THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO NORTH FLORIDA, THEN STALL SOMEWHERE OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE WIND WILL BECOME LIGHTER ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA, WITH THE RIDGING WEAKENING. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR THE SEA BREEZES TO MEET MORE IN THE INTERIOR. ALSO, WITH THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE FLATTENED, THE CONVECTION WILL BE ABLE TO BECOME BETTER DEVELOPED. THE FRONT WILL SLOWLY DRIFT SOUTH AND BECOME MORE AND MORE DIFFUSE THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THIS WILL ALLOW THE CONTINUATION OF DIURNAL CONVECTION THROUGH THE WEEKEND. BY THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK, HIGH PRESSURE WILL ONCE AGAIN STRENGTHEN OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AND A 500MB RIDGE WILL ALSO BUILD ONCE AGAIN, BRINGING US BACK INTO OUR CURRENT PATTERN, WITH AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE CWA, POSSIBLY EVEN JUST ALONG THE GULF COAST. AVIATION... VFR CONDITIONS FORECAST TO PREVAIL THROUGH THE TAF PERIOD. EASTERLY WINDS 5-10 KNOTS OVERNIGHT WILL INCREASE TO 10 KNOTS FOR THE EAST COAST TAF SITES AFTER 14Z...AND THEN TO AROUND 12 KNOTS BY 18Z. A FEW COASTAL SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE IN THE MORNING...BUT DRIER AIR WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION. FOR KAPF...GULF COAST SEA BREEZE FORECAST TO DEVELOP BETWEEN 19-21Z. A FEW SHOWERS OR STORMS MAY FORM ALONG THE SEA BREEZE...BUT PROBABILITY TOO LOW TO MENTION ATTM. MARINE... HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WILL KEEP THE WEATHER MOSTLY QUIET OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA COASTAL WATERS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT WILL STALL BY WEDNESDAY EVENING OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR AN INCREASE IN SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY FROM WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND. BY MONDAY, THE AREA WILL RETURN TO A SIMILAR PATTERN AS WE ARE UNDER NOW. CURRENTLY EXPECTING A GRADUAL INCREASE IN WAVE HEIGHTS UP TO AROUND 3 FEET BY THE WEEKEND. 
DEEP HI PRES RIDGE CENTERED OVER S GA AND THE FL PANHANDLE REMAINS THE DOMINANT WX FEATURE FOR CENTRAL FL...GENERATING A LIGHT ERLY FLOW AND CLEAR SKIES THIS MRNG.

A 10SEC ERLY SWELL IS KEEPING SEAS IN THE 2-3FT RANGE NEARSHORE AND 3-4FT RANGE OFFSHORE. FAVORABLE BOATING CONDS THRU TUE AS THE HI PRES RIDGE REMAINS THE DOMINANT WX FEATURE. THE LIGHT ERLY SFC/BNDRY LYR WINDS WILL GRADUALLY VEER TO THE S/SW OVERNIGHT AS A COLD FRONT PUSHES INTO THE DEEP SOUTH AND SHUNTS THE RIDGE E OF THE BAHAMAS. 
NO CHANGES TO ONGOING FORECAST AS SURFACE RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO DEFLECT ENERGY WEST OF THE REGION WITH MID LEVEL SHORTWAVE PUSHING THROUGH THE MS/AL VICINITY TODAY. THIS WILL KEEP ANY SCATTERED AFTERNOON SHOWERS/STORMS MAINLY OVER INLAND SE GA AND THE I-75 CORRIDOR OF NORTHEAST FLORIDA. ATLC COAST SEA BREEZE WILL PUSH FAR ENOUGH INLAND TO KEEP COASTAL MAX TEMPS IN THE 80S AND NEAR 90 INLAND. A FEW STRONG STORMS WITH GUSTY WINDS AND/OR SMALL HAIL NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION OVER FAR INLAND AREAS BUT OVERALL SEVERE WEATHER IS NOT EXPECTED. ACTIVITY WILL LINGER OVER INLAND AREAS UNTIL AROUND MIDNIGHT...THEN FAIR SKIES EXPECTED WITH LOWS IN THE UPPER 60S INLAND AND LOWER 70S ALONG THE COAST. 
VFR WITH SCATTERED CUMULUS IN THE 3000-5000 FT RANGE THIS AFTERNOON AND CONVECTION GENERALLY STAYING WEST OF TERMINALS. 
LIGHT SE FLOW TODAY BECOMES SOUTHWEST TONIGHT. SEAS GENERALLY 2-4 FT. RIP CURRENTS: MODERATE RISK TODAY. 
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD. EASTERLY WINDS WILL INCREASE TO 10 TO 15 KNOTS BY THE MIDDLE OF THE MORNING. DRIER AIR WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE INTO THE REGION TODAY, HOWEVER A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A THUNDERSTORM CANNOT BE RULED OUT AFTER 18Z. AT KAPF, A GULF COAST SEA BREEZE WILL DEVELOP LATER THIS AFTERNOON WHICH WILL SHIFT THE WINDS TO A WESTERLY DIRECTION. THIS SEA BREEZE WILL DIMINISH LATER THIS EVENING. 
DISCUSSION... TODAY WILL BEGIN WITH A 500MB RIDGE OVER THE EAST COAST OF THE US AND A SFC HIGH OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. THE SFC HIGH WILL KEEP THE WIND GENERALLY OUT OF THE EAST ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA. WITH DAYTIME HEATING, THE SEA BREEZES WILL KICK IN. WITH THE EAST FLOW, THE ATLANTIC BREEZE WILL DOMINATE AND PUSH ACROSS THE INTERIOR, WHILE THE GULF BREEZE STRUGGLES TO MOVE VERY FAR INLAND AT ALL. THEY LOOK TO MEET JUST TO THE EAST OF THE NAPLES METRO AREA. THIS GENERAL VICINITY LOOKS TO HAVE THE BEST CHANCES OF CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON, ALTHOUGH IT CAN STILL FORM ANYWHERE OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AS THE ATLANTIC BREEZE MOVES INLAND. WITH A FAIRLY STRONG HIGH ALOFT, 500MB HEIGHTS AT AROUND 590DM, 3-6KM LAPSE RATES OF AROUND 6 C/KM, NCAPE OF AROUND .12, PWATS OF AROUND 1.75 INCHES, AND THE ONLY REAL FORCING, BESIDES DAYTIME HEATING, ARE THE SEA BREEZE FRONTS, THE MAIN THREAT WILL BE GENERAL THUNDERSTORMS. HOWEVER, AS WITH MOST SOUTH FLORIDA THUNDERSTORM, THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED STRONG THUNDERSTORM, ESPECIALLY IN THE VICINITY OF WHERE THE SEA BREEZES MEET. THIS SAME PATTERN REPEATS TOMORROW. THEN, FOR WEDNESDAY, THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL BE FLATTENED OUT AND THE SFC HIGH WILL HAVE WEAKENED. THIS IS AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION, THEN TO THE NORTHEAST. THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO NORTH FLORIDA, THEN STALL SOMEWHERE OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE WIND WILL BECOME LIGHTER ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA, WITH THE RIDGING WEAKENING. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR THE SEA BREEZES TO MEET MORE IN THE INTERIOR. ALSO, WITH THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE FLATTENED, THE CONVECTION WILL BE ABLE TO BECOME BETTER DEVELOPED. THE FRONT WILL SLOWLY DRIFT SOUTH AND BECOME MORE AND MORE DIFFUSE THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THIS WILL ALLOW THE CONTINUATION OF DIURNAL CONVECTION THROUGH THE WEEKEND. BY THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK, HIGH PRESSURE WILL ONCE AGAIN STRENGTHEN OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AND A 500MB RIDGE WILL ALSO BUILD ONCE AGAIN, BRINGING US BACK INTO OUR CURRENT PATTERN, WITH AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE CWA, POSSIBLY EVEN JUST ALONG THE GULF COAST. AVIATION... VFR CONDITIONS FORECAST TO PREVAIL THROUGH THE TAF PERIOD. EASTERLY WINDS 5-10 KNOTS OVERNIGHT WILL INCREASE TO 10 KNOTS FOR THE EAST COAST TAF SITES AFTER 14Z...AND THEN TO AROUND 12 KNOTS BY 18Z. A FEW COASTAL SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE IN THE MORNING...BUT DRIER AIR WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION. FOR KAPF...GULF COAST SEA BREEZE FORECAST TO DEVELOP BETWEEN 19-21Z. A FEW SHOWERS OR STORMS MAY FORM ALONG THE SEA BREEZE...BUT PROBABILITY TOO LOW TO MENTION ATTM. MARINE... HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WILL KEEP THE WEATHER MOSTLY QUIET OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA COASTAL WATERS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT WILL STALL BY WEDNESDAY EVENING OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR AN INCREASE IN SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY FROM WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND. BY MONDAY, THE AREA WILL RETURN TO A SIMILAR PATTERN AS WE ARE UNDER NOW. CURRENTLY EXPECTING A GRADUAL INCREASE IN WAVE HEIGHTS UP TO AROUND 3 FEET BY THE WEEKEND. 
[THROUGH 12Z TUESDAY]... LIFR VISIBILITIES HAVE HELD ON THIS MORNING AT ECP WHILE MVFR VISIBILITIES ARE ON DHN`S DOORSTEP. EXPECT RESTRICTIONS TO ONLY LAST ANOTHER HOUR OR TWO BEFORE VFR PREVAILS (OUTSIDE OF STORMS) FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY. STORMS WILL BE MOST LIKELY AT TLH AND VLD LATER TODAY, WITH A SCATTERING OF STORMS AROUND ABY. FOG IS EXPECTED ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT AT ECP AND DHN. 
THE RECENTLY DOMINANT UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN CONUS WILL FLATTEN TONIGHT AND TUESDAY, WHILE A SURFACE COLD FRONT APPROACHES SLOWLY FROM THE NORTH. DESPITE THE APPROACHING FRONT, THERE APPEARS TO BE LITTLE IN THE WAY OF Q-G FORCING THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THUS MOST (IF NOT ALL) OF THE FORCING FOR DEEP MOIST CONVECTION WILL HAVE TO COME FROM MESOSCALE BOUNDARIES LIKE THE SEA BREEZE FRONT. THE DAYTIME POPS WILL RANGE FROM 20 TO 40 PERCENT, WHICH ARE NEAR CLIMO VALUES. TEMPERATURES WILL BE A LITTLE ABOVE CLIMO, AROUND 70 AT NIGHT, WITH HIGHS IN THE LOWER TO MID 90S INLAND. WITH WEAK WINDS ALOFT AND UNSPECTACULAR FORCING, THE THREAT FOR ORGANIZED SEVERE STORMS APPEARS LOW. HOWEVER, THERE WILL BE ENOUGH DEEP LAYER MOISTURE AND MLCAPE FOR A STORM OR TWO TO BRIEFLY BECOME STRONG TO SEVERE. 
WITH A VERY WEAK PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS THE MARINE AREA TODAY, WINDS WILL BE LIGHT ONSHORE, EXCEPT A LITTLE BIT STRONGER NEAR THE COAST THIS AFTERNOON DUE TO THE STRONG HEATING OF THE LAND. AS A COLD FRONT SLOWLY APPROACHES FROM THE NORTH AND THE RIDGE ACROSS OUR REGION SHIFTS TO THE SOUTH, WINDS WILL BECOME WEST TO SOUTHWEST THROUGH THURSDAY. THEY WILL BE LIGHT DURING THE OVERNIGHT AND MORNING HOURS, THEN INCREASE TO MODERATE LEVELS EACH AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH THE STRONG HEATING OF THE LAND. 
MOST OF THE RIVERS THAT SHOWED A MODEST RISE FROM THE HEAVIER RAINS LATE LAST WEEK HAVE LEVELED OFF. WE EXPECT THE RAIN OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS TO BE TOO SPOTTY FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS TO THE LOCAL RIVER STAGES. 
FL...DENSE FOG ADVISORY UNTIL 10 AM EDT /9 AM CDT/ THIS MORNING FOR      CENTRAL WALTON-COASTAL BAY-COASTAL GULF-HOLMES-INLAND BAY-      INLAND GULF-NORTH WALTON-SOUTH WALTON-WASHINGTON. GA...NONE. AL...DENSE FOG ADVISORY UNTIL 9 AM CDT THIS MORNING FOR COFFEE-GENEVA. GM...NONE. 
TODAY WILL BE A TRANSITION DAY FROM OVERALL SYNOPTIC EASTERLY FLOW TO MORE WESTERLY FLOW FOR TUESDAY AND BEYOND. THE UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE THAT HAS BEEN OVER THE REGION WILL REMAIN OVERHEAD BUT WILL SHIFT WESTWARD A BIT THROUGH THE DAY. AT THE SURFACE...THE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED TO OUR NORTHEAST WILL SLOWLY DRIFT SOUTHWARD AND WEAKEN. THIS WILL LEAD TO A LESS EASTERLY AND MORE VARIABLE FLOW...WHICH MEANS THAT WE WILL LOSE THE ENHANCED CONVERGENCE ALONG THE WEST COAST IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH THE WEST COAST SEA BREEZE. THE AREA WILL ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY SOME DRIER AIR AND SO POPS THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE MUCH LOWER THAN SUNDAY...GENERALLY IN THE ISOLATED TO LOW-END SCATTERED RANGE FOR THE LATE AFTERNOON HOURS. AS WE HEAD INTO TUESDAY...THE UPPER- LEVEL FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL WHILE AT THE SURFACE...A WEAKENING FRONTAL BOUNDARY TREKS TOWARD NORTHERN FLORIDA BY THE END OF THE DAY. BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW WILL BE MORE WESTERLY FOR TUESDAY...WHICH WILL SHIFT THE BEST RAIN CHANCES OVER THE INTERIOR LATER IN THE AFTERNOON. WARM TEMPERATURES CONTINUE FOR BOTH DAYS...WITH HIGHS IN THE LOWER 90S...EXCEPT COOLER AT THE IMMEDIATE COAST. 
GENERALLY VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS. EXPECT AN TURN ONSHORE FOR WINDS IN THE AFTERNOON WITH THE SEA BREEZE...BUT THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE TODAY IS EXPECTED TO BE MUCH LOWER THAN ON SUNDAY. WINDS EXPECTED TO BECOME LIGHT AND VARIABLE TONIGHT. 
LIGHT EAST TO SOUTHEAST WINDS EARLY TODAY WILL BECOME MORE WEST TO NORTHWEST AS THE SEA BREEZE DEVELOPS THIS AFTERNOON. FOR TUESDAY AND THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK...WINDS WILL BECOME MORE WESTERLY WHICH WILL HELP KEEP MOST OF THE SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY AWAY FROM THE WATERS. WINDS AND SEAS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW HEADLINES. 
NO FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES WILL REMAIN ABOVE CRITICAL LEVELS. NO SIGNIFICANT FOG IS EXPECTED. 
DEEP LAYER RIDGING WILL REMAIN PRESENT ACROSS THE ENTIRE SOUTHEAST TODAY. AT THE SURFACE, THE WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY THAT HAD BEEN PRESENT FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS HAS DIMINISHED AS OUTFLOW FROM THE ATLANTIC SEABREEZE SPREADS WEST THROUGH THE TRI-STATE REGION AND FUNNELS IN A MORE HOMOGENEOUS AIRMASS. A WEAK SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE IS FORECAST TO TRAVERSE THE AREA TODAY AND WILL LIKELY ACT TO GENERATE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AWAY FROM THE SEABREEZE FRONTS ACROSS PORTIONS OF SOUTH GEORGIA AND SOUTHEAST ALABAMA. THOUGH, THE MORE ROBUST AND WIDESPREAD CONVECTION WILL INITIALLY BE FOUND ALONG THE BIG BEND SEABREEZE. THERE IS EXPECTED TO BE A SOMEWHAT DISCERNIBLE WEST TO EAST POP GRADIENT TODAY AS SUBSIDENCE ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED WAVE INHIBITS AFTERNOON CONVECTION. THE CURRENT THINKING ADVERTISES THE BEST POPS EAST OF THE APALACHICOLA AND CHATTAHOOCHEE RIVERS TODAY, WITH ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS TO THE WEST. OUTFLOW FROM SEABREEZE STORMS EARLIER IN THE AFTERNOON WILL SPREAD NORTH AND INTERACT WITH STORMS AND OUTFLOW FROM SCATTERED CONVECTION GENERATED BY THE UPPER WAVE. THIS WILL LIKELY RESULT IN A CONDENSED AREA OF STORMS (AND HIGHEST POPS) AROUND THE FL/GA SUWANNEE VALLEY LATE THIS AFTERNOON. AFTERNOON HIGHS WILL BE SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY, AROUND 90 DEGREES. 
THE AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY ENTER OUR FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT, THEN BECOME ORIENTED EAST TO WEST AND QUASI- STATIONARY ACROSS, OR A LITTLE SOUTH OF, OUR FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THE FRONT WILL GRADUALLY DISSIPATE SUNDAY OR MONDAY AS A STRONG, DEEP LAYER RIDGE DEVELOPS ACROSS MUCH OF THE EASTERN SEABOARD. POPS WILL BE NEAR CLIMO VALUES, GENERALLY IN THE 20-30 PERCENT RANGE DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO BE A LITTLE ABOVE CLIMO, NEAR 70 AT NIGHT AND IN THE LOWER TO MID 90S (INLAND) DURING THE DAY. 
[THROUGH 06Z TUESDAY] LIFR VISIBILITIES AT ECP THIS MORNING WILL PREVAIL UNTIL ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO AFTER SUNRISE. THE REDUCED VISIBILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO OVERSPREAD DHN LATER THIS MORNING, BUT MAY ONLY RESULT IN MVFR RESTRICTIONS. ELSEWHERE, VFR SHOULD PREVAIL THROUGH THE AFTERNOON OUTSIDE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THE BEST CHANCE FOR RAIN THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE AT TLH AND VLD, WITH VCTS AT ABY. 
HAZARDOUS FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE NOT EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. 
TODAY WILL BEGIN WITH A 500MB RIDGE OVER THE EAST COAST OF THE US AND A SFC HIGH OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. THE SFC HIGH WILL KEEP THE WIND GENERALLY OUT OF THE EAST ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA. WITH DAYTIME HEATING, THE SEA BREEZES WILL KICK IN. WITH THE EAST FLOW, THE ATLANTIC BREEZE WILL DOMINATE AND PUSH ACROSS THE INTERIOR, WHILE THE GULF BREEZE STRUGGLES TO MOVE VERY FAR INLAND AT ALL. THEY LOOK TO MEET JUST TO THE EAST OF THE NAPLES METRO AREA. THIS GENERAL VICINITY LOOKS TO HAVE THE BEST CHANCES OF CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON, ALTHOUGH IT CAN STILL FORM ANYWHERE OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AS THE ATLANTIC BREEZE MOVES INLAND. WITH A FAIRLY STRONG HIGH ALOFT, 500MB HEIGHTS AT AROUND 590DM, 3-6KM LAPSE RATES OF AROUND 6 C/KM, NCAPE OF AROUND .12, PWATS OF AROUND 1.75 INCHES, AND THE ONLY REAL FORCING, BESIDES DAYTIME HEATING, ARE THE SEA BREEZE FRONTS, THE MAIN THREAT WILL BE GENERAL THUNDERSTORMS. HOWEVER, AS WITH MOST SOUTH FLORIDA THUNDERSTORM, THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED STRONG THUNDERSTORM, ESPECIALLY IN THE VICINITY OF WHERE THE SEA BREEZES MEET. THIS SAME PATTERN REPEATS TOMORROW. THEN, FOR WEDNESDAY, THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL BE FLATTENED OUT AND THE SFC HIGH WILL HAVE WEAKENED. THIS IS AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION, THEN TO THE NORTHEAST. THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO NORTH FLORIDA, THEN STALL SOMEWHERE OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE WIND WILL BECOME LIGHTER ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA, WITH THE RIDGING WEAKENING. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR THE SEA BREEZES TO MEET MORE IN THE INTERIOR. ALSO, WITH THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE FLATTENED, THE CONVECTION WILL BE ABLE TO BECOME BETTER DEVELOPED. THE FRONT WILL SLOWLY DRIFT SOUTH AND BECOME MORE AND MORE DIFFUSE THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THIS WILL ALLOW THE CONTINUATION OF DIURNAL CONVECTION THROUGH THE WEEKEND. BY THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK, HIGH PRESSURE WILL ONCE AGAIN STRENGTHEN OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AND A 500MB RIDGE WILL ALSO BUILD ONCE AGAIN, BRINGING US BACK INTO OUR CURRENT PATTERN, WITH AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE CWA, POSSIBLY EVEN JUST ALONG THE GULF COAST. 
VFR CONDITIONS FORECAST TO PREVAIL THROUGH THE TAF PERIOD. EASTERLY WINDS 5-10 KNOTS OVERNIGHT WILL INCREASE TO 10 KNOTS FOR THE EAST COAST TAF SITES AFTER 14Z...AND THEN TO AROUND 12 KNOTS BY 18Z. A FEW COASTAL SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE IN THE MORNING...BUT DRIER AIR WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION. FOR KAPF...GULF COAST SEA BREEZE FORECAST TO DEVELOP BETWEEN 19-21Z. A FEW SHOWERS OR STORMS MAY FORM ALONG THE SEA BREEZE...BUT PROBABILITY TOO LOW TO MENTION ATTM. 
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WILL KEEP THE WEATHER MOSTLY QUIET OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA COASTAL WATERS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT WILL STALL BY WEDNESDAY EVENING OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR AN INCREASE IN SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY FROM WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND. BY MONDAY, THE AREA WILL RETURN TO A SIMILAR PATTERN AS WE ARE UNDER NOW. CURRENTLY EXPECTING A GRADUAL INCREASE IN WAVE HEIGHTS UP TO AROUND 3 FEET BY THE WEEKEND. 
THROUGH TUESDAY AS THE MID LEVEL RIDGE MOVES SWD WHILE MID LEVEL TEMPS DROP A BIT AND AFTN DEWPOINTS CREEP UP TO ABOUT 70 BY TUE. FOR TODAY...LOW LEVEL RIDGE WILL BE ORIENTED OVER SRN GA WITH WEAK ELY FLOW PUSHING THE E COAST SEA BREEZE INLAND DURING THE DAY. WEAKER FLOW THOUGH WILL ENABLE THE W COAST SEA BREEZE TO PUSH INLAND AND MEET WITH THE E COAST BOUNDARY W OF THE HIGHWAY 301. A SUBTLE LOW LEVEL TROUGH MAY HELP INITIATE WEAK CONVECTION OVER THE INLAND AREAS NEAR AND W OF ALMA GA TO LIVE OAK FL...AS WELL AS ALONG THE W COAST SEA BREEZE. BEST FOCUS IN THE AFTN HOURS WILL BE ACROSS INLAND ZONES WHERE WE HAVE PLACED 30-50 PERCENT CHANCES...WITH 20 PERCENT OR LESS E OF HIGHWAY 301. VERY SLOW STORM MOTION WILL PRODUCE LOCALLY RAINFALL AND GUSTY WINDS IN THE STRONGER STORMS. SIMILAR HIGH TEMP READINGS TO YESTERDAY IN THE MID AND UPPER 80S COASTAL AREAS...WITH AROUND 90 INLAND. TONIGHT...STILL EXPECTING SCT CONVECTION FOR THE INLAND AREAS IN THE EVENING...AS DEWPOINTS RISE FROM THE AFTN MINIMUM AND LEFTOVER BOUNDARIES TRIGGER CONVECTION. RAIN CHANCES ARE ADVERTISED AT 30-40 PERCENT FOR INLAND AREAS AGAIN AND 20 PERCENT OR LESS FOR THE COASTAL COUNTIES. LOWS WILL BE IN THE UPPER 60S AND LOWER 70S. TUESDAY...MORE CHANGES ON THE WAY...WITH THE MID LEVEL RIDGE WEAKER AS IT SHIFTS SWD INTO GOMEX WITH SFC RIDGE MOVING INTO CENTRAL FL. A WEAK COOL FRONT EXPECTED TO PUSH INTO N CENTRAL GA BY LATE TUE AFTN. TEMPS ALOFT ARE ABOUT 1 DEG COOLER AND MEAN LAYER STEERING FLOW SPEEDS UP TO ABOUT 10 KT FROM THE W. HIGHER DEWPOINTS AND A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH SHOULD PRODUCE A MUCH BETTER RAIN OF SHOWERS AND STORMS FOR MAINLY AFTN HOURS ESPECIALLY FOR THE ERN ZONES THAT HAVE BEEN LARGELY DRY FOR 2 WEEKS. WE HAVE GONE WITH MID RANGE SCATTERED POPS...WITH A FOCUS FOR SLIGHTLY HIGHER CHANCES ABOUT 50-60 PERCENT FOR THE E CENTRAL HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA BASED ON CONSENSUS GUIDANCE. TYPICAL ISOLD STRONG STORMS POSSIBLE WITH GUSTY WINDS AND FREQUENT LIGHTNING WITH SBCAPES ESTIMATED TO BE 2500-3000 J/KG. HIGH TEMPS FROM THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S. 
PREVAIL AT VFR NEXT 24 HRS. SCT-BKN CUMULUS CLOUDS FROM 3000-5000 FT DURING THE DAY WITH POSSIBLE ISOLD CONVECTION NEARING THE TERMINALS LATE IN THE DAY AND EVENING HOURS BUT CONFIDENCE/PROBABILITIES ARE TOO LOW AT THIS POINT. 
WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVES INTO THE FORECAST REGION. E TO SE FLOW NEAR 10 KT TODAY WILL BE WEAKER ON TUE AND MORE OFFSHORE FLOW INITIALLY ON WEDNESDAY BUT E COAST SA BREEZE STILL LIKELY BY AFTN. ONSHORE FLOW WILL BEGIN TO ESTABLISH FOR ALL WATERS BY EARLY THIS COMING WEEKEND. OVERALL FAIRLY TYPICAL SUMMER-LIKE PATTERN AND NO HEADLINES EXPECTED AT THIS TIME. SEAS MAINLY 2-4 FT. RIP CURRENTS: MODERATE RISK TODAY...AND LOW TO MODERATE TUE WITH SLIGHTLY LOWER SURF CONDS. 
WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVES INTO THE FORECAST REGION. E TO SE FLOW NEAR 10 KT TODAY WILL BE WEAKER ON TUE AND MORE OFFSHORE FLOW INITIALLY ON WEDNESDAY BUT E COAST SA BREEZE STILL LIKELY BY AFTN. ONSHORE FLOW WILL BEGIN TO ESTABLISH FOR ALL WATERS BY EARLY THIS COMING WEEKEND. OVERALL FAIRLY TYPICAL SUMMER-LIKE PATTERN AND NO HEADLINES EXPECTED AT THIS TIME. SEAS MAINLY 2-4 FT. RIP CURRENTS: MODERATE RISK TODAY AND LOW TO MODERATE WED WITH LOWER SURF CONDS. 
CURRENT...CLEAR SKIES AND AN ECHO-FREE RADAR THIS MORNING. A FEW WEAK CU LINES NOTED ON 3.9UM UPSTREAM AROUND THE BAHAMAS...BUT NIL ECHOES SHOWING UP ON THE STATEWIDE MOSAIC AS WELL...OWING TO MEAN DRYING WHICH OVERSPREAD MUCH OF THE PENINSULA ON SUNDAY (SURFACE TDS HAVE DROPPED INTO THE M-U60S). LIGHT WINDS OVER THE INTERIOR...WITH TEMPS IN THE U60S-L70S...WHILE A LIGHT ONSHORE BREEZE IS KEEPING READINGS IN THE M70S (U70S ALONG THE SPACE/TREASURE COAST BEACHES). TODAY/TONIGHT...WEAKER ONSHORE FLOW WILL TRANSLATE INTO A SLOWER INLAND PUSH TO THE ECSB...HOWEVER RELATIVELY DRIER AIR MASS SHOULD KEEP VERTICAL EXTENT UP DIURNAL CU FIELD IN CHECK FOR THE MOST PART. PROBABLY CAN`T RULE OUT A VERY ISOLATED POP UP SHOWER ALONG LCL SEA AND LAKE BOUNDARY INTERFACES...BUT IF THAT WERE TO OCCUR IT WOULD BE VERY BRIEF AS THE LCL AIR MASS WILL NOT MAINTAIN CONVECTIVE UPDRAFTS WELL TODAY. MAXES IN THE M-U80S ALONG THE COAST AND AROUND 90F INLAND WITH MINS WITHIN A COUPLE OF DEGS OF 70F. RIP CURRENT THREAT WILL INCREASE TODAY AS 3-4FT SWELL PERIOD HAS LENGTHENED OUT TO AROUND 10SEC. TUE-FRI...NOT MUCH CHANGE IN THE ONGOING FORECAST AS WE WILL BE GOING INTO A WETTER PATTERN MID WEEK AS WEAK MID LEVEL TROUGHING DEVELOPS ACROSS THE EASTERN US THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK. WEAKENING SURFACE FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. ON TUE AND WASH OUT ACROSS THE NORTH/CENTRAL FL PENINSULA INTO LATE WEEK. MODELS SHOW WEAK LOW FORMATION ALONG THE BOUNDARY ACROSS NORTH FL/SOUTHEASTERN US OF VARYING DEGREES. THIS MAY HAVE SOME EFFECT ON THE LOCAL LOW LEVEL WIND FIELD...BUT DOESN`T APPEAR TO INFLUENCE OVERALL RAIN CHANCES DRAMATICALLY. OVERALL THE AREA WILL SEE SCATTERED AFTERNOON AND EVENING SHOWERS AND STORMS AS MOISTURE INCREASES WITH STALLING FRONTAL BOUNDARY  AND TROUGH ALOFT PROVIDES SOME ADDITIONAL INSTABILITY. WEST-NORTHWEST STEERING FLOW WILL FOCUS MORE AFTERNOON CONVECTION BACK TO THE EAST COAST. OFFSHORE FLOW WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO DELAY THE ONSET/INLAND MOVEMENT OF THE EAST COAST SEA BREEZE...BUT NOT PREVENT IT ALTOGETHER. LATER SEABREEZE WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO WARM INTO THE UPPER 80S AND LOW 90S...EVEN AT THE COAST. NEXT WEEKEND...FRONTAL BOUNDARY WASHES OUT TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEK AS SURFACE HIGH MOVES OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST. THIS WILL PLACE THE PENINSULA BACK IN PREVAILING ONSHORE FLOW AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS BACK OVERHEAD WITH SOME MID LEVEL DRYING TRENDS INDICATED. PATTERN LOOKS TO RETURN TO ONSHORE MOVING ATLANTIC SHOWERS ALONG THE COAST WITH AFTERNOON CONVECTION ONCE AGAIN FOCUSED OVER THE INTERIOR AND WEST FLORIDA. 
THE ECSB ALONG THE DAB-SUA CORRIDOR 14Z-18Z. 
FLOW HAS VEERED TO ESE-SE. HOWEVER...SEAS REMAIN IN THE 3-4FT RANGE DUE TO A LENGTHENING 10SEC PERIOD SWELL. OVER THE NEXT H24...EXPECT MINIMAL CHG TO SEAS WITH SMALL/3FT SWELL PERSISTING AS WINDS VEER FURTHER TO SE-S ON THE WEST SIDE OF WEAKENING RIDGE SAGGING SWD TO A POSN OFFSHORE CTRL FL. TUE-THURS...RIDGE AXIS MOVES SOUTH OF THE REGION ON TUE AS FRONTAL BOUNDARY SAGS DOWN THE EASTERN SEABOARD AND EVENTUALLY WASHES OUT OVER THE REGION WED AND THURS. PREVAILING SOUTHWEST WINDS AROUND 10KTS WITH SOME BACKING EAST-SOUTHEAST IN THE AFTERNOONS NEAR THE COAST WITH THE SEABREEZE. SEAS GENERALLY 2-3FT OCCASIONALLY UP TO 4FT WELL OFFSHORE. THE MAIN MARINER WEATHER HAZARD WILL BE OFFSHORE MOVING AFTERNOON/EVENING STORMS WHICH SHOULD START IN THE NORTH TUE AND THEN AFFECT THE REST OF THE COAST WED/THU. FRI-SAT...FRONTAL BOUNDARY WASHES OUT ACROSS THE REGION LATE WEEK WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN FROM THE NORTH INTO NEXT WEEKEND. WINDS WILL BE FAIRLY LIGHT AND VARIABLE ON FRIDAY BEFORE SEA BREEZE CIRCULATION SETS UP IN THE AFTERNOON WITH STRONGER EAST-NORTHEAST WINDS ARRIVING INTO SAT AS GRADIENT TIGHTENS ON SOUTH SIDE OF ATLANTIC SURFACE HIGH. 
AVAILABLE IR IMAGERY OVERLAID WITH MODEL STREAMLINE ANALYSIS AS OF 300 AM CONTINUE TO ILLUSTRATE A FAST MIDDLE AND UPPER SOUTHERN BRANCH OF THE JET...WITH NEAR 50 KNOTS AT 500 MB AND 100 KNOTS AT 250 MB RACING FROM BAJA CALIFORNIA BEFORE DECELERATING AND SPLITTING OVER THE LONE STAR STATE. DOWNSTREAM OF THAT...A MIDDLE AND LEVEL REGIONAL SCALE BLOCKY ANTICYCLONE IS WELL ALIGNED OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO...CLOSE TO THE FLORIDA KEYS. 
ISLANDS AND SURROUNDING WATERS...WITH RADAR DETECTING AT MOST SOME LOW CUMULUS CLOUDS WITH NO DISCERNIBLE ECHOES PRODUCING MEASURABLE RAIN ATTM. TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE ISLANDS ARE AROUND 80 WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER TO MID 70S. C-MAN STATIONS ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF...FLORIDA BAY...ARE RIGHT NEAR 15 KNOTS...AND 10 TO 15 KNOTS AT SMITH SHOAL LIGHT. 
HOURS...WITH GENTLE EAST WINDS EXPECTED BY THIS AFTERNOON AND CONTINUING THRU TUESDAY NIGHT...BEFORE SLACKENING TO LIGHT AND VARIABLE UNDER A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN EXPECTED FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THIS WEEK. 
TERMINALS. WITH THAT SAID...LOWER LEVEL FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BECOME EAST NORTHEASTERLY THIS AFTERNOON...PROVIDING PERIODS FAVORABLE FOR ISLAND CLOUD LINE FORMATION. THERE WILL BE A CHANCE FOR BRIEF MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS RELATED TO CEILINGS AND SHOWERS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CLOUD LINE. SURFACE WINDS WILL BE 10 KNOTS OR LESS...MAINLY EASTERLY. 
SHOWERS HAVE BEEN ISOLATED IN THE GULF WATERS OFFSHORE OF MAINLAND MONROE COUNTY AND IN THE ATLANTIC WATERS ADJACENT AND OFFSHORE FROM THE UPPER KEYS THIS EVENING. OTHERWISE...SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY ACROSS THE KEYS WITH A MODERATE EASTERLY BREEZE IN PLACE. TEMPERATURES ALONG THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE IN THE LOWER 80S. THE LATE EVENING LOCAL SOUNDING SHOWS THE EASTERLY BREEZES ARE EVEN DEEPER THAN YESTERDAY EVENING. BUT THE MODERATE SPEEDS ONLY EXTEND TO ABOUT 10000 FEET. THERE IS A LITTLE RESISTANCE TO BUOYANCY IN THE LOWER LAYERS AS WELL. THE TREND FOR THE ECHOES ON KBYX DOPPLER RADAR HAS BEEN FOR THE SHOWERS TO WEAKEN AS THEY APPROACH THE UPPER KEYS. A SLIGHT CHANCE OF MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION WILL REMAIN THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD. UNLESS WINDS DROP OFF DRAMATICALLY...WHICH WE ARE NOT ANTICIPATING...NO ZONE UPDATE IS NECESSARY THIS EVENING. 
OVERALL...THE EASTERLY BREEZES WILL BE SLOWLY DIMINISHING OVER THE NEXT FEW PERIODS. HOWEVER...WINDS ACROSS THE STRAITS WILL BE ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN AN EXERCISE CAUTION FOR SMALL CRAFT OVERNIGHT. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR WATERS SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST OF THE LOWER KEYS. EXPECT LITTLE CHANGE ON THE UPCOMING MARINE UPDATE FROM THE EARLY EVENING ISSUANCE. 
VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO PREVAIL AT BOTH THE KEY WEST AND MARATHON TERMINALS THROUGH MONDAY. SURFACE WINDS WILL BE MAINLY FROM THE EAST AOA 11 KNOTS. 
SEA BREEZE DRIVEN CONVECTION NOW WANING OVER THE COASTAL COUNTIES THIS EVENING WILL SHIFT WEST INTO THE GULF WATERS IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS WHERE IT WILL DISSIPATE BY LATER TONIGHT. CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDINESS WILL THIN OUT WITH CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND WARM CONDITIONS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT. LOWS WILL RANGE FROM AROUND 70 OVER INLAND AREAS TO THE LOWER 70S ALONG THE COAST. WILL REMOVE EVENING RAIN CHANCES FROM THE GRIDS AND ZONES IN A MID EVENING UPDATE...OTHERWISE NO OTHER CHANGES EXPECTED AT THIS TIME. 
BRIEF MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS WILL BE RETURN TO THE TERMINALS AFTER 20Z ON MONDAY AS SHOWERS AND STORMS RE-DEVELOP OVER THE REGION AND HAVE HANDLED WITH VCTS FOR NOW...OTHERWISE VFR IS EXPECTED. EAST TO SOUTHEAST WINDS AT 10 KNOTS OR LESS WILL PREVAIL EXCEPT BECOMING SOUTHWEST TO WEST AT THE COASTAL SITES AFTER 20Z ON MONDAY AS THE SEA BREEZE DEVELOPS...WITH GUSTS UP TO 30 KNOTS POSSIBLE IN THE VICINITY OF TSRA. 
HIGH PRESSURE OFF THE CAROLINAS THIS EVENING WILL MAINTAIN AN EAST TO SOUTHEAST WIND FLOW ACROSS THE GULF WATERS THE REMAINDER OF TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY AS THE HIGH SINKS SOUTHWARD TOWARD THE BAHAMAS...WITH A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN SUPPORTING AN ONSHORE SEA BREEZE COMPONENT ALONG THE COAST MONDAY AFTERNOON. ONGOING FORECAST IS ON TRACK WITH NO CHANGES EXPECTED IN THE LATE EVENING UPDATE. 
TONIGHT-MON...MID LEVEL RIDGE ALONG THE EASTERN SEABOARD WILL CONTINUE TO BE CAUGHT BETWEEN TROUGHS OVER THE MID PART OF THE CONUS AND ANOTHER OVER THE ATLANTIC.  THE ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE WILL WEAKEN AND BE NUDGED A LITTLE SOUTH BY A BACK DOOR FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THE ATLANTIC TROUGH.  THIS WILL CAUSE LOW LEVEL ONSHORE FLOW TO EASE WHILE CONTINUING TO TAP DRIER/SUBSIDENT AIR OUT OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC.  EVENING RADAR HAS ONLY BEEN SHOWING A FEW SPRINKLES OFFSHORE.  THEREFORE THE CURRENT DRY FORECAST LOOKS GOOD AND NO CHANGES ARE PLANNED.. 
SLIGHTLY DRIER AND WILL BE DECREASING A BIT...THERE COULD BE LOCAL MVFR CEILINGS ESPECIALLY AT THE COASTAL SITES OVERNIGHT/MORNING. 
TONIGHT-MON...LOCAL PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL SLACKEN AS RIDGE AXIS VICINITY CAROLINA COAST NUDGES SOUTH TO NEAR 30N LATITUDE AND WEAKENS.  THIS WILL CAUSE EAST/SOUTHEAST WINDS TO DIMINISH TO 10 KNOTS OR LESS OVERNIGHT AND ON MON. WIND WAVES LOOK MUCH MORE TOLERABLE FOR SMALL CRAFT OPERATORS BUT OVERALL SEAS WILL STILL BE 3- 4 FEET DUE TO A FRESH EAST SWELL WITH 9-10 SECOND PERIODS. 
A FEW SHOWERS WEST OF INTERSTATE 75 WILL WIND DOWN OVER THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO DUE TO THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING. WINDS WILL ALSO SETTLE DOWN THIS EVENING WITH A PERIOD OF NEAR CALM CONDITIONS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT RELAXES AND THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE DECOUPLES. SKIES WILL ALSO BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR OVERNIGHT AND THIS MAY PROMOTE SOME PATCHY SHALLOW GROUND FOG IN A FEW SPOTS LATE TONIGHT. OVERNIGHT TEMPS WILL REMAIN A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL OVER INLAND AREAS WITH LOWS IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S. 
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGH THE NEXT 24 HOURS. A BRIEF PERIOD OF PATCHY SHALLOW GROUND FOG CANNOT BE COMPLETELY RULED OUT LATE TONIGHT BUT CHANCES ARE TOO LOW TO INCLUDE THIS IN THE TAF. 
SOUTHEAST WINDS 10 TO 15 KNOTS THIS EVENING WILL TURN TO THE SOUTH AND DECREASE TO LESS THAN 10 KNOTS AFTER MIDNIGHT. SEAS WILL ALSO REMAIN BELOW ANY HEADLINE CRITERIA. THE CURRENT FORECAST HAS THIS HANDLED WELL AND NO UPDATES WILL BE NEEDED THIS EVENING. RIP CURRENTS: LOW TO MODERATE RISK EXPECTED ON MONDAY. 
MOST CONVECTION HAS WAINED FOR THE EVENING. THE EXCEPTION IS ALONG THE MERGER OF THE EAST AND GULF COAST SEA BREEZES WHERE WE ARE SEEING LATE DAY CONVECTION INCREASING NEAR THE SUWANNEE RIVER. THE REMNANTS OF THIS ACTIVITY COULD LINGER AFTER SUNSET, MAINLY ACROSS THE FLORIDA BIG BEND. ELSEWHERE, POPS WILL BE LOWERED. SOME PATCHY FOG IS POSSIBLE ACROSS OUR WESTERN ZONES OVERNIGHT, BUT WE WILL MORE LIKELY SEE LOW CEILINGS. 
[THROUGH 00Z TUESDAY] AN ISOLATED SEA BREEZE SHOWER OR STORM COULD APPROACH VLD EARLY IN THE PERIOD. OTHERWISE, SOME GUIDANCE SHOWS IFR CEILINGS DEVELOPING OVER THE EASTERN TERMINAL WHILE OTHER GUIDANCE SHOWS THIS TO THE WEST. WE HAVE DECIDED TO TREND THE FORECAST IN THIS DIRECTION WITH MVFR CEILINGS AND SCATTERED LOWER CLOUDS. CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO BE WIDESPREAD ACROSS THE AERODROME ON MONDAY AND SHOULD BE EXPECTED AT THE TERMINALS DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. 
LOCALLY, ZONAL TO WEAK TROUGHING WILL PREVAIL IN THE MID TO UPPER LEVELS THROUGH FRIDAY BEFORE RIDGING BUILDS BACK IN OVER THE WEEKEND. AT THE SURFACE, A WEAK FRONT WILL BE DRAPED OVER OR JUST SOUTH OF OUR FA THROUGH THE PERIOD. POPS WILL BE HIGHEST ON WEDNESDAY (30-50%) AND THEN MAINLY LOWER END CHANCE (30%) THROUGH THE NEXT WEEKEND. TEMPERATURES WILL BE A LITTLE ABOVE CLIMO, WITH LOWS AROUND 70 AND HIGHS IN THE LOWER TO MID 90S. 
RELATIVE HUMIDITY WILL REMAIN ABOVE CRITICAL LEVELS THIS WEEK. 
AFTERNOON CONVECTION HAS DIMINISHED.

SYNOPSIS... 19Z WATER VAPOR AND H4 RAP ANALYSIS CONTINUE TO SHOW AN AMPLIFIED UPPER LEVEL PATTERN IN PLACE ACROSS THE CONUS. A LONGWAVE TROUGH WITH A NOW HIGHLY NEGATIVE TILT IS PIVOTING NORTHWARD THROUGH THE CENTRAL/NORTHERN PLAINS AND UPPER MIDWEST...WHILE DOWNSTREAM WE FIND AMPLIFIED RIDGING OVER THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION... INCLUDING THE FL PENINSULA. THE 12Z KTBW SOUNDING SHOWS A FAIRLY MOIST COLUMN WITH A PW VALUE OF OVER 1.5"...AND LITTLE OVERALL RESISTANCE TO PARCEL LIFT. LOW AND MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES ARE RIGHT AROUND 6C/KM. ONCE AGAIN...WE DO NOT SEE ANY SIGNIFICANT LAYERS OF HOSTILE AIR TOWARD DEEP CONVECTION WITH MINIMUM THETAE VALUES WITHIN THE 700-500MB LAYER ALL GENERALLY ABOVE 322K. THE SOUNDING SHOWS WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED UNDER THE MIDDLE OF A BIG UPPER RIDGE...AND THAT IS WEAK...ALMOST VARIABLE FLOW THROUGH THE TROP COLUMN. THIS WEAK FLOW IS GOING TO RESULT IN SLOW STORM MOTION TODAY AS WELL. IF THE DEGREE OF THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT EXPECTED COMES TO PASS...THEN THE THREAT OF LOCALIZED FLOODING EXISTS TODAY...ESPECIALLY IF ANY OF THE STORMS MIGRATE OVER URBAN CENTERS. AT THE SURFACE...ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE HAS SETTLED A BIT SOUTH DURING THE PAST 24 HOURS...AND NOW RIDGES BACK WESTWARD TO NEAR OR JUST NORTH OF THE I-10 CORRIDOR. THE RESULTING SYNOPTIC FLOW PATTERN (1000-700MB) ACROSS OUR REGION IS 5-10 KNOTS FROM THE E/SE. 
UPDATE (REST OF TODAY AND TONIGHT)... AS MENTIONED IN THE SYNOPSIS OUR LARGE SCALE FLOW PATTERN IS 5-10 KNOTS FROM THE EAST TO SOUTHEAST TODAY. THIS MODERATE SOUTHEAST FLOW IS GENERALLY OUR MOST ACTIVE SUMMER THUNDERSTORM REGIME...AS IT BOTH TENDS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A MOIST PATTERN...AND ALSO PROVIDES THE MECHANISMS FOR ENHANCED LOW LEVEL FOCUS/CONVERGENCE ALONG THE WEST COAST SEABREEZE. YESTERDAY...WHERE THE SEA-BREEZE WAS ABLE TO MAKE A BIT OF SMALL PROGRESS INLAND (BASICALLY SOUTH OF TAMPA BAY)...THIS CONVERGENCE WAS EFFICIENT AND THUNDERSTORMS ERUPTED VERY CLOSE TO THE COAST LATE IN THE AFTERNOON. TODAY...THE FLOW JUST ABOVE THE SURFACE APPEARS LIGHT ENOUGH TO ALLOW THIS MORE EFFICIENT CONVERGENCE TO OCCUR ALONG MUCH...IF NOT ALL OF THE FLORIDA WEST COAST. THEREFORE...THINK WE WILL SEE THE ACTIVE CONVECTION EXPAND NORTHWARD THROUGH THE LATER AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING HOURS INTO THE TAMPA BAY AREA...AND EVEN NORTHWARD THROUGH QUITE A BIT OF THE NATURE COAST. THE HRRR GUIDANCE THUS FAR TODAY HAS BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE WITH THE CONVECTION ALONG OUR ENTIRE I-75 CORRIDOR...AND GIVEN THE FAVORABLE SYNOPTIC SETUP...SEE LITTLE REASON TO DISAGREE WITH ITS GENERAL OUTPUT. RAIN CHANCES IN THE 60-70% RANGE SEEM REASONABLE ALONG THE GENERAL I-75 CORRIDOR NORTHWARD TO NEAR BROOKSVILLE... AND THEN WILL HAVE 50% FOR THE FAR NORTHERN ZONES. BTW...THE HRRR DID A VERY GOOD JOB WITH THE PLACEMENT AND TIMING OF THE CONVECTION ON SATURDAY...SHOWING CONVECTIVE COVERAGE MAINLY EXTENDING FROM MANATEE COUNTY SOUTHWARD ALONG THE COAST DURING THE MORNING RUNS. THIS VERIFIED VERY WELL. THERE IS NOT A WHOLE LOT OF MOTION IN THE ATMOSPHERE SITTING UNDER THE MIDDLE OF THE UPPER RIDGE...AND THEREFORE STORMS ARE NOT GOING TO BE FAST MOVERS...PROPELLED ALONG BY WEAK FLOW...AND/OR OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MOVEMENT. THE GENERAL MOTION SHOULD BE TOWARD THE COAST AND EVENTUALLY OFFSHORE. HOWEVER...THE SLOW MOTION IS GOING TO RESULT IN A HEAVY RAIN/LOCALIZED FLOODING THREAT. ALL OF THE CONVECTION ALLOWING GUIDANCE IS SHOWING THE POTENTIAL FOR IMPRESSIVE UPDRAFT VELOCITY VALUES AS WELL (MAXIMUM VALUES ON THE ORDER OF 14-18M/S). THE STRONG UPDRAFTS WOULD BE CORRELATED WITH VERY EFFICIENT LIGHTING PRODUCTION AS WELL. ACTIVITY LINGERS INTO THE EVENING HOURS...AND MAY EVEN PEAK IN SOME SPOTS BETWEEN 6-9PM. THEREAFTER...MOST GUIDANCE MEMBERS SHOW THE STORMS MIGRATING OFFSHORE INTO THE EASTERN GULF AND WEAKENING. WILL SLOWLY RAMP DOWN POPS NEAR THE COAST THROUGH THE MID/LATE EVENING...AND RETURN ALL AREAS TO A DRY FORECAST AFTER MIDNIGHT. THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL KEEP US SEASONABLY WARM OVERNIGHT... WITH MOST SPOTS SEEING LOW TEMPS BY SUNRISE IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S. ON MONDAY...WE ARE STILL UNDER THE UPPER RIDGE...HOWEVER THE RIDGE AXIS BEGIN TO SHIFT WESTWARD OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO BY THE END OF THE DAY. THE BIGGER CHANGE TO INFLUENCE OUR FORECAST WILL BE THE CONTINUED SLOW MOVEMENT AND GENERAL WEAKENING OF THE SUBTROPICAL ATLANTIC RIDGE. OUR FLOW LOOKS TO BECOME MUCH LIGHTER AND MORE VARIABLE IN NATURE BY MONDAY AFTERNOON...AND THIS WILL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SEVERAL DAYS NOT ENHANCE FOCUS ALONG THE WEST COAST SEA BREEZE. WE STILL EXPECT A FEW STORMS TO BUILD DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS...HOWEVER THE POTENTIAL COVERAGE IS MUCH LESS THAN TODAY...AND WILL KEEP ALL AREAS AT 30-40% OR LESS FOR RAIN CHANCES. AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES SHOULD GENERALLY RISE INTO THE UPPER 80S TO NEAR 90...WITH LOWER TO MIDDLE 80S AT THE BEACHES WITH THE DEVELOPING ONSHORE FLOW. 
RIDGING INITIALLY ACROSS MUCH OF THE GULF REGION PUSHES BACK TO THE WESTERN GULF BY MID-WEEK AS A TROUGH SWEEPS OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND INTO THE LOWER SAINT LAWRENCE VALLEY..SAGGING DOWN THE EASTERN SEABOARD. FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK A PACIFIC LOW MOVES ACROSS CA TO THE GREAT BASIN THEN OUT OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS...AS A TROUGH...FOR THE WEEKEND. IN RESPONSE THE WEST GULF RIDGE BUILDS BACK INTO THE REST OF THE GULF AND OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES. SURFACE - HIGH PRESSURE SPRAWLS FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS SOUTH TO A FRONT THAT ARCS FROM THE GREAT LAKES THROUGH THE SOUTHERN PLAINS THEN UP ACROSS THE INTERIOR PACIFIC NORTHWEST. ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE RIDGES WEST THROUGH NORTH FL TO THE CENTRAL GULF COAST. WITH TIME THE PLAINS HIGH PRESSURE SETTLES INTO THE MID CONUS THEN TRACKS EAST...REACHING THE LOWER GREAT LAKES AND NORTHEAST U.S. BY SUN. THIS WILL ADVANCE THE FRONT EAST AND SOUTH...BECOMING DIFFUSE ACROSS THE CENTRAL GULF COAST AND NORTHERN FL. AS A RESULT THE ATLANTIC RIDGE SAGS SOUTH OF THE STATE BY MID-WEEK THEN LIFTS BACK NORTH FOR THE WEEKEND AND GETS REINFORCED BY THE HIGH OVER THE NORTHEAST BRIDGING THE FRONT. AMPLE MOISTURE...MODEL PWAT VALUES RUN 1.5 TO 1.8 INCHES...WILL REMAIN IN PLACE FOR MOST OF THE PERIOD TO SUPPORT ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THE EXCEPTION WILL BE AROUND FRI WHEN SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR FILTERS IN WITH SHOWER AND STORMS COVERAGE DECREASING SOME. AS THE SURFACE RIDGE AXIS TRAVERSES SOUTH DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE PERIOD LOW LEVEL SOUTHEAST FLOW/ WITH AFTERNOON SEA BREEZES/ SWITCHES TO WESTERLY THROUGH THU...WITH SHOWERS AND STORMS FAVORING INLAND LOCATIONS. THEN WINDS VEER THROUGH THE NORTH LATE THU AND FRI AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES INTO THE EASTERN CONUS AND PUSHES THE FRONT DOWN ACROSS THE STATE...WHICH ALONG WITH THE BUILDING UPPER RIDGE EXPLAINS THE SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR FRI. EAST AND SOUTHEAST LOW LEVEL FLOW...WITH AFTERNOON SEA BREEZES...RETURNS FOR THE WEEKEND. TEMPERATURES WILL RUN NEAR OR JUST ABOVE NORMAL. 
VFR CONDITIONS LATE THIS MORNING ACROSS WEST-CENTRAL FLORIDA. SCT-BKN CUMULUS FIELD HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED AND WILL BE WITH US THE REST OF THE DAY...WITH BASES RAISING FROM AROUND 3KFT TO 5KFT THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP ALONG THE I-75 CORRIDOR THIS AFTERNOON AND PROGRESS WESTWARD TOWARD THE COAST AFTER DEVELOPMENT. HAVE INCLUDED TEMPOS FOR THE EXPECTED CONVECTION. ACTIVITY WILL PROGRESS OFFSHORE BY LATE EVENING. 
ONSHORE WINDS ALONG THE COAST WILL SHIFT BACK TO AN EASTERLY OFFSHORE DIRECTION BY LATER THIS EVENING. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THAT DEVELOP OVER THE LAND LATE TODAY WILL SHIFT WESTWARD TOWARD THE COASTAL WATERS THROUGH THIS EVENING. BOATERS ON THE COASTAL WATERS AND BAYS SHOULD KEEP A CLOSE WATCH ON THE WEATHER AND BE PREPARED TO SEEK SAFE HARBOR QUICKLY...AS STORMS ARE LIKELY TO RAPIDLY DEVELOP AND MOVE OFFSHORE. BY TUESDAY AND THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK...WIND FLOW WILL BECOME MORE WESTERLY...AND KEEP THE MAJORITY OF THE STORMS INLAND. WINDS AND SEAS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW HEADLINE CRITERIA. 
NO FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES WILL REMAIN ABOVE CRITICAL LEVELS. AFTER A ROUND OF NUMEROUS THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE I-75 CORRIDOR INTO THIS EVENING...THE PATTERN WILL BEGIN TO CHANGE. STORMS APPEAR LESS NUMEROUS FOR MONDAY...AND THEN WILL BE MAINLY LOCATED INLAND FROM THE I-75 CORRIDOR DURING THE MIDDLE PORTION OF THE WEEK. FOG IMPACT...NO SIGNIFICANT FOG IS EXPECTED FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS...BUT LATE NIGHT PATCHY GROUND FOG COULD DEVELOP IN AREAS THAT SEE RAIN DURING THE EVENING HOURS. 
UNDER THE WESTERN EDGE OF STACKED HIGH PRESSURE, WITH WARM, MOIST AIR FEEDING INTO THE AREA FROM THE GULF, THE SEABREEZE FRONT THIS AFTERNOON WILL HELP TO DEVELOP THUNDERSTORMS. THESE STORMS ARE EXPECTED TO BE FOCUSED MOSTLY OVER THE FL PANHANDLE AND SE AL, WITH MORE ISOLATED COVERAGE TO THE EAST. IN THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT HOURS, WE MAY ALSO SEE SOME OF THE EAST COAST SEABREEZE STORMS REACH THE FL BIG BEND AND SOUTHERN GA. THE WIND PROFILE ALOFT HAS VERY LOW WIND SPEEDS AND SHEAR VALUES, SO SEVERE STORMS ARE NOT LIKELY TODAY, ALTHOUGH A FEW STORMS COULD PRODUCE GUSTY WINDS AT TIMES. THIS WEAK WIND PROFILE ALSO MEANS THAT STORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE, WHICH COULD LEAD TO FAIRLY HIGH RAINFALL TOTALS IN THE AREAS WHERE STORMS DEVELOP. TEMPERATURES WILL BE SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN NORMAL WITH HIGHS TODAY IN THE LOW 90S AND LOWS TONIGHT IN THE UPPER 60S TO AROUND 70. 
[THROUGH 18Z MONDAY] SCATTERED SEABREEZE THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP NEAR ECP AND DHN THIS AFTERNOON AND THE EAST COAST SEABREEZE MAY REACH VLD AND TLH LATE IN THE EVENING, THOUGH THERE IS LESS CONFIDENCE IN THIS, SO LEFT IT OUT OF THE TAF FOR NOW. ON MONDAY, MVFR CEILINGS MAY BE POSSIBLE AT AREA TERMINALS IN THE MORNING BEFORE AFTERNOON SEABREEZE STORMS DEVELOP, THOUGH CONFIDENCE ON TIMING AND LOCATION IS LOW AT THIS TIME, SO KEPT THESE MOSTLY SCATTERED IN THIS TAF PACKAGE. 
LIGHT WINDS AND LOW SEAS WILL PREVAIL AT LEAST THROUGH TUESDAY WITH A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN ACROSS THE MARINE AREA. WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE SOME BY MID WEEK AS A WEAK COLD FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE NORTH. 
THE RAIN ON SATURDAY WAS MORE SPOTTY THAN THE PREVIOUS TWO DAYS, AND CONFINED MOSTLY TO SOUTHEAST AL. SOME OF THE RIVERS, MAINLY IN THE FL PANHANDLE, SOUTHWEST GA, AND SOUTHEAST AL, HAVE RISEN A BIT OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS. HOWEVER, ALL OF OUR RIVERS WERE BELOW THEIR LOCAL ACTION STAGES, AND THE LATEST MMEFS FORECASTS THIS TO CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. ALTHOUGH RAIN CHANCES WILL BE A LITTLE ABOVE CLIMO MONDAY ACROSS MUCH OF OUR AREA MONDAY AND TUESDAY AFTERNOONS, IT DOES NOT APPEAR THERE WILL BE ENOUGH ORGANIZATION FOR A HEAVY RAIN THREAT. 
FL...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK UNTIL 8 PM EDT /7 PM CDT/ THIS EVENING FOR      COASTAL BAY-COASTAL FRANKLIN-COASTAL GULF-SOUTH WALTON. GA...NONE. AL...NONE. GM...NONE. 
AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS THIS AFTERNOON REVEALS A PERSISTENT DEEP LAYER MEAN ANTICYCLONE CENTERED JUST EAST OF CENTRAL FLORIDA. THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE AT THE SOUTHERN FLANK OF THIS SYSTEM...WITH DEEP EASTERLY FLOW PREVAILING. A ROBUST SURFACE ANTICYCLONE PERSISTS AS WELL FROM THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN. ISOLATED SHOWERS HAVE BEEN ON RADAR FOR MOST OF THE DAY...WITH MOST CELLS RATHER WEAK AND SHORT-LIVED...A FEW WETTING SOME ISLAND COMMUNITIES AS THEY MOVE WEST-NORTHWESTWARD NEAR 15 KNOTS. A ROBUST TRADE-WIND TYPE SUBSIDENCE INVERSION PERSISTS. CURRENTLY...AIR TEMPERATURES IN MOST KEYS ISLAND COMMUNITIES ARE IN THE UPPER 80S...AND DEWPOINT TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MID 70S. EAST WINDS ARE BLOWING NEAR 15 MPH OVER LAND...AND ARE CURRENTLY GUSTING OVER 20 MPH ATOP THE WEATHER OFFICE IN KEY WEST. FORECASTS -- THE BASIC FORECAST REASONING REMAINS LARGELY UNCHANGED. SIGNIFICANT CYCLONIC WEATHER SYSTEMS AND FORCING FOR ASCENT WILL REMAIN FAR FROM THE FLORIDA KEYS. HOWEVER...HEIGHT FALLS OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES WILL RESULT IN A BREAK-DOWN OF THE DEEP LAYER MEAN ANTICYCLONE OVER FLORIDA MONDAY AND TUESDAY...WITH A CORRESPONDING WEAKENING OF THE WESTERN ATLANTIC SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CELL. AS A RESULT...BREEZES WILL DROP OFF SIGNIFICANTLY BY TUESDAY. OVERALL CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY AND LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE WILL UNDERGO LITTLE CHANGE. HOWEVER...THE PRIMARY MESOSCALE AGENT OF LIFT WILL SHIFT FROM CONFLUENT/CONVERGENT IMPULSES WITHIN MODERATE EAST- SOUTHEAST FLOW TO ISLAND DIFFERENTIAL HEATING CIRCULATIONS AND MIGRANT OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES. THE ACTUAL 12-HOUR MEASURABLE RAIN CHANCES WILL STAY AROUND 20 PERCENT THROUGH THE UPCOMING WEEK. HOWEVER...THESE MAY NEED TO BE TWEAKED AS A MORE PRECISE LOW-LEVEL FLOW PATTERN BECOMES APPARENT EACH DAY. ISLAND HIGH TEMPERATURES MAY INCREASE BY A DEGREE OR TWO...ESPECIALLY BY WEDNESDAY...AS WINDS LIGHTEN AND NEARSHORE WATERS AND SALT PONDS CONTINUE WARMING UNDER HOT MAY SUN. 
SMALL CRAFT SHOULD EXERCISE CAUTION FOR THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA TONIGHT AS EAST WINDS BLOW STEADY 15-20 KNOTS. SEAS UP TO 6 FEET ARE LIKELY IN THE GULF STREAM...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE LOWER STRAITS OF FLORIDA BETWEEN CUBA AND THE DRY TORTUGAS. A HIGH PRESSURE CELL OFF THE CAROLINA COAST WILL WEAKEN GRADUALLY AS IT MOVES SOUTHWARD TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY. THE HIGH THEN WILL SPLIT OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. MODERATE TO FRESH BREEZES TONIGHT WILL SLACKEN BY TUESDAY...BECOMING LIGHT TO GENTLE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. 
VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO PREVAIL AT BOTH THE KEY WEST AND MARATHON TERMINALS THROUGH TOMORROW. SURFACE WINDS WILL REMAIN MAINLY EAST TO SOUTHEAST NEAR 12 KNOTS...DECREASING A FEW KNOTS LATER TONIGHT. BRIEF ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS EYW AND VICINITY THIS EVENING. 
TONIGHT-MONDAY... LOW RAIN CHANCES ACROSS THE REGION AS A WELL DEVELOPED STORM SYSTEM OVER THE NRN PLAINS RIDES OVER THE TOP OF THE H100-H70 RIDGE AXIS BLANKETING THE ERN CONUS...PRESSING ITS CENTER S TOWARD THE BAHAMAS. THE RIDGE WILL WEAKEN AS IT DRIFTS OVER THE WARM W ATLC WATERS... RESULTING IN A SLACKENING SFC/LOW LVL PGRAD. MEANWHILE...THE MID LVL RIDGE AXIS WILL RETREAT INTO THE GOMEX...ALLOWING MID LVL WINDS TO VEER TO THE N/NW BUT REMAINING BLO 10KTS. LOW ENERGY/RH AIR ASSOCD WITH THE RIDGE WILL PUSH INTO CENTRAL FL AS THE RIDGE DROPS S. H100-H70 MEAN RH VALUES WILL DROP BLO 70PCT WHILE THE NRLY MID LVL WINDS TAP AN H85-H70 AIRMASS WITH LAPSE RATES BLO 4.0C/KM. NO SIG MID LVL VORT MAXES PRESENT THRU EITHER THE H85-H50 OR H85-H30 LYRS...WHILE H30-H20 WINDS BLO 20KTS WILL KEEP THE UPR LVLS NEUTRAL AT BEST. WEAKENING ERLY WINDS THRU THE H100-H85 LYR...DRY AIR ADVECTION... AND NRLY H85-H50 WINDS AOB 10KTS NOT FAVORABLE FOR OVERNIGHT COASTAL SHRAS...WHILE THE STABILIZING H85-H70 LYR WILL PUT A SIG CAP ON DIURNAL CONVECTION MON AFTN. NO MENTIONABLE PRECIP CHANCES. THE LIGHT/STEADY ONSHORE FLOW WILL KEEP MIN TEMPS ARND 5F ABV AVG... U60S/L70S INTERIOR AND L/M70S ALONG THE COAST...MAX TEMPS NEAR AVG WITH U80S INTERIOR AND M/80S ALONG THE COAST. MON NIGHT... WEAK HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS OVER THE AREA WITH ALL CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY EXPECTED TO BE WEST OF ECFL BY 00Z THIS EVENING. WILL KEEP CONDITIONS DRY OVERNIGHT WITH THINNING CLOUD DEBRIS. WINDS WILL BECOME LIGHT AND VARIABLE. OVERNIGHT MIN TEMPERATURES IN THE U60S/L70S. TUE-SAT...(PREVIOUS DISCUSSION) WETTER PATTERN WILL BE IN PLACE AS MID LEVEL RIDGE BREAKS DOWN MID WEEK AND WEAK TROUGHING DEVELOPS ACROSS THE EASTERN US THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK. ASSOCIATED WEAK SURFACE FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE SOUTHEASTERN US ON TUE AND WASH OUT ACROSS THE FL PENINSULA INTO LATE WEEK. THE PRESENCE OF THE TROUGH...FRONT...AND INCREASE IN MOISTURE WITH THE FRONT ALONG WITH WEAK TROUGHING WILL KEEP SCATTERED AFTERNOON AND EVENING SHOWERS AND STORMS IN THE FORECAST THROUGH THE PERIOD. STEERING FLOW...AT LEAST FROM WEDNESDAY ONWARDS...BECOMES MORE DEFINITELY WEST-NORTHWEST WHICH SHOULD FOCUS MORE AFTERNOON CONVECTION BACK TO THE EAST COAST. OFFSHORE FLOW WILL BE RIGHT AT THAT POINT WHERE IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO DELAY THE ONSET/INLAND MOVEMENT OF THE EAST COAST SEA BREEZE...BUT NOT PREVENT IT ALTOGETHER. LATER SEABREEZE WILL BRING WARM TEMPS WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S AND LOW 90S. BY NEXT WEEKEND...ANOTHER SURFACE HIGH MOVING OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST LOOKS TO BECOME THE DOMINANT FEATURE PLACE THE PENINSULA BACK IN PREVAILING ONSHORE FLOW AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGING BUILDS BACK OVERHEAD WITH SOME DRYING TRENDS INDICATED.

TUE-FRI...(PREVIOUS DISCUSSION) RIDGE GETS SHUNTED SOUTHWARDS ON TUE AS FRONTAL BOUNDARY SAGS DOWN THE EASTERN SEABOARD AND EVENTUALLY WASHES OUT OVER THE REGION WED AND THURS. MODELS ARE HINTING AT WEAK LOW FORMATION ALONG THE BOUNDARY TO THE NORTHEAST...WHICH MAY AFFECT THE ULTIMATE WIND DIRECTION...BUT OVER ALL TREND WILL BE FOR PREVAILING SOUTH/SOUTHWEST WINDS 10KTS WITH SOME BACKING EAST-SOUTHEAST IN THE AFTERNOONS WITH THE SEABREEZE. THE MAIN MARINER WEATHER HAZARD WILL BE OFFSHORE MOVING AFTERNOON/EVENING STORMS WHICH SHOULD START IN THE NORTH TUE AND THEN AFFECT THE REST OF THE COAST WED/THU. 
ARE ANTICIPATED THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...PRIMARILY OVER WRN HALF OF FORECAST AREA...DIMINISHING AFTER SUNSET...THEN CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES WITH LOW TEMPS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE UPPER 60S INLAND...LOWER 70S COAST. PATCHY FOG POSSIBLE LATE...PARTICULARLY IN AREAS THAT GET RAINFALL. 
A BIT FURTHER SOUTH OVER NORTH FLORIDA WITH A WEAK FRONTAL WAVE OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY. ON FRIDAY THE FRONTAL SYSTEM BECOMES MORE DIFFUSE WITH WIDELY SCATTERED AFTERNOON AND EVENING CONVECTION. OVERALL TEMPERATURES WILL BE CLOSE TO CLIMATOLOGY THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH THE GREATEST RAIN CHANCES MID-WEEK. 
OF ANY TSRA THAT DEVELOP IN THE AFTERNOON...BEST CHANCE KGNV WHERE VCTS INCLUDED. 
SLOWLY SHIFT SE THIS WEEK AS A COLD FRONT SLOWLY APPROACHES THE WATERS. NO HEADLINES EXPECTED. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS DEVELOP ACROSS THE WATERS BY MID WEEK OUT AHEAD OF THE FRONT WITH WINDS VEERING TO SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST. RIP CURRENTS: MODERATE RISK TODAY...AND LOW TO MODERATE RISK MONDAY. 
OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS, PWATS HAVE INCREASED ABOUT A HALF INCH. SLICE OF BETTER MIDLEVEL MOISTURE, WHICH ARRIVED FROM THE ATLANTIC YESTERDAY, WILL BE REPLACED WITH A DRIER PUNCH, WHICH HAS BEEN SITTING OFF THE CAROLINA/GEORGIA COAST OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS. THUS, SHOWERS HAVE BEEN MORE NUMEROUS ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA TODAY, AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE ALREADY BROKEN OUT ALONG THE WEST COAST. SEA BREEZE HAS INCREASED ACTIVITY THERE THIS AFTERNOON. PWATS DO DROP OF RATHER QUICKLY ALONG THE EAST COAST TONIGHT, AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN MODEL QPF FIELDS SHOWING LESS RAIN ALONG THE COAST AND OFFSHORE FOR MONDAY MORNING COMPARED TO THIS MORNING. IN GENERAL, MONDAY SHOULD BE A MUCH DRIER DAY THAN TODAY, AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WEAKENS AND IS FORCED SOUTH INTO THE BAHAMAS, AS LOW PRESSURE MOVES OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST. WITH LESS GRADIENT, THE WEST COAST SEA BREEZE MAY EVOLVE A LITTLE EARLIER IN THE AFTERNOON THAN THE PAST FEW DAYS. INTO TUESDAY AND THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK, THE MID AND UPPER RIDGE BEGINS TO FLATTEN AND THE ENTIRE PATTERN BECOMES LESS AMPLIFIED. A WEAK FRONT/TROUGH ATTACHED TO LOW PRESSURE MOVING THROUGH NEW ENGLAND STALLS ACROSS NORTHERN FLORIDA. TEMPS ALOFT WILL COOL AND MIDLEVEL LAPSE RATES WILL INCREASE SLIGHTLY. WITH MOISTURE INCREASING AND POTENTIALLY A BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE ACROSS PART OF THE STATE, SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BECOME MORE NUMEROUS ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE INTERIOR TO CLOSE OUT THE WORK WEEK. BY LATE WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK, LONG RANGE GUIDANCE INDICATES A RETURN OF MID AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGING ALONG MUCH OF THE SOUTHEAST COAST AND FLORIDA. THEREFORE, THE EASTERLY FLOW REGIME RETURNS, WITH MOST ACTIVITY FOCUSED ALONG THE WEST COAST. 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INCREASING IN COVERAGE OVER INTERIOR AND GULF COAST THIS AFTERNOON AS MOIST EASTERLY FLOW INTERACTS WITH DAYTIME HEATING. HAVE TEMPO TSRA WITH MVFR CONDITIONS AT KAPF/NAPLES THROUGH 22Z, WITH LINGERING SHRA/TSRA POSSIBLE EVEN AFTER 00Z AS BACK EDGE OF DEEPER MOISTURE STILL BACK OVER SE FLORIDA AT THIS TIME. FOR THE EAST COAST SITES, SHOWERS WILL LINGER IN VICINITY OF AIRPORTS FOR A GOOD PART OF THE AFTERNOON AS A SECOND AREA OF SHOWERS APPROACHES FROM THE BAHAMAS. NO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CEILING/VISIBILITY EXPECTED, ALTHOUGH BRIEF MVFR CONDITIONS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE FROM PBI ALL THE WAY DOWN TO TMB. AFTER 00Z, A GENERAL DRYING TREND IS EXPECTED AS DRIER AIR MOVES INTO AREA FROM THE EAST. THIS TREND SHOULD RESULT IN LOWER RAIN COVERAGE OVERNIGHT INTO FIRST PART OF MONDAY ALONG WITH LIGHT NE-E SFC WINDS. 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE WESTERN ATLANTIC THROUGH THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK WITH EASTERLY FLOW GENERALLY AROUND 10 TO 15 KNOTS. AS A WEAK BOUNDARY ENTERS NORTHERN FLORIDA, WINDS WILL BECOME LIGHTER AND MORE FROM THE SOUTH INTO MIDWEEK. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL ALSO BECOME MORE NUMEROUS BY LATE WEEK. 
ISSUED AT 1223 AM CDT TUE MAY 19 2015 UPDATED FOR AVIATION DISCUSSION BELOW... 


ISSUED AT 245 AM CDT TUE MAY 19 2015 AN UPPER TROUGH WILL REMAIN OVER THE NORTHLAND TODAY...BUT DRIER AIR AND WEAK HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE SHOULD SCOUR OUT THE CLOUDS THAT COVERED MOST AREAS AS OF 0730Z AND KEEP MOST AREAS DRY TODAY. SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS CONTINUED EARLY THIS MORNING UNDER THIS DECK OF STRATOCU AND THAT WILL CONTINUE UNTIL IT CLEARS. MORE PERSISTENT SNOW SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE OVER THE SNOWBELT REGION OF ASHLAND/IRON COUNTIES. A SPOTTER IN GILE REPORTED SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATION SHORTLY AFTER 05Z AND WEBCAMS AROUND IRONWOOD ALSO SHOW SOME LIGHT ACCUMULATION. SHIP AND BUOY OBS INDICATE THE LAKE IS AROUND 2 TO 4C AND WITH 850MB TEMPS AROUND -10C THIS MORNING...FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR SNOW SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE THIS MORNING. THE LAKE EFFECT WILL DIMINISH BY LATE MORNING AS TEMPS WARM AND DRIER AIR CONTINUE TO MOVES IN. WE FOLLOWED THE RAP/NAM ON CLEARING TODAY AND WENT WITH HIGHS IN THE FIFTIES FOR MOST AREAS. TONIGHT WILL BE MOSTLY CLEAR...WITH SOME HIGH CLOUDS MOVING IN. THE CLOUDS SHOULD BE THIN ENOUGH AND WINDS LIGHT ENOUGH TO ALLOW FOR COLD TEMPERATURES. MOST AREAS WILL DROP BELOW FREEZING...WITH SOME LOCALIZED AREAS INTO THE LOWER TWENTIES. WE EXPECT PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES WEDNESDAY WITH TEMPERATURES WARMING INTO THE LOWER TO MIDDLE SIXTIES. A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL JUST BE NEARING THE INTERNATIONAL BORDER BY EARLY WEDNESDAY EVENING. 
ISSUED AT 1223 AM CDT TUE MAY 19 2015 EXPECT PREVAILING VFR THROUGH THE NEXT 24 HOURS AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS. WINDS WILL BECOME LIGHT AND VARIABLE OVERNIGHT... AND WILL PICK UP AGAIN WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON OUT OF THE WEST. 
MN...NONE. WI...NONE. LS...NONE. 
ISSUED AT 653 AM CDT TUE MAY 19 2015 AN AREA OF STRATUS IS MOVING SOUTHEAST THIS MORNING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES ARE IFR-MVFR ACROSS THE DLH AND HYR TAF SITES.  THE BACK END OF THE CLOUDS WILL CLEAR DLH BY 14Z AND HYR BY 16Z RAINING CIGS TO VFR. ELSEWHERE SKIES WILL REMAIN VFR THROUGH THE TIME PERIOD AS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE DOMINATES THE WEATHER, 
MN...NONE. WI...NONE. LS...SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY UNTIL 7 AM CDT THIS MORNING FOR LSZ121-140-      146>148. 

ISSUED AT 346 AM CDT TUE MAY 19 2015 THE PRIMARY CONCERN IN THE SHORT TERM IS THE POTENTIAL FOR A FROST/FREEZE TONIGHT...AS TEMPERATURES DIP 10-15 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. THE SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT IN THE WAKE OF THE DEPARTING TROUGH HAS REMAIN PACKED TIGHTLY ENOUGH TO KEEP WINDS IN THE 6-12KT RANGE OVERNIGHT...WHILE THE BKN-OVC STRATUS DECK HAS SUPPLIED SOME INSULATION AS WELL. THEREFORE...TEMPERATURES HAVE HELD UP IN THE 35 TO 40 DEGREE RANGE WITHOUT MUCH IN THE WAY OF POTENTIAL FOR FROST...OTHER THAN IN PARTS OF CENTRAL MN UP TOWARD ALEXANDRIA AND LITTLE FALLS. TONIGHT COULD BE A DIFFERENT STORY HOWEVER...AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT SLACKENS AND WINDS LIGHTEN. MID/HIGH CLOUDS ARE FORECAST TO INCREASE AS A TROUGH LIFTS TOWARD SOUTHERN MINNESOTA...BUT IT MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE ENOUGH TO PREVENT TEMPS FROM FALLING INTO THE UPPER 20S AND LOWER 30S TONIGHT. OF GREATEST CONCERN WILL BE LOCATIONS NORTH OF INTERSTATE 94 WHERE THE CLOUDS WILL TAKE LONGER TO SPREAD INTO. WILL LIKELY NEED AT LEAST A FROST ADVISORY FOR SAID AREA. IN THE MEANTIME...ANOTHER COLD DAY IS IN STORE FOR THE AREA...ALTHOUGH NOT AS COLD AS MONDAY. HIGHS WILL MAINLY BE IN MID 50S...WHICH IS AROUND 15 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. 
ISSUED AT 645 AM CDT TUE MAY 19 2015 LINGERING MVFR LEVEL CLOUDS WILL PLAGUE THE SITES AT TIMES THIS MORNING...AND THEN SKIES WILL BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR THIS AFTERNOON. TONIGHT HIGH CLOUDS WILL ADVANCE IN FROM THE SOUTH. NORTHWEST WINDS AROUND 10KTS BECOME LIGHT AND VARIABLE TONIGHT. KMSP... FLEETING MVFR LEVEL CLOUDS ARE POSSIBLE THIS MORNING...THEN MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES THIS AFTERNOON. HIGH CLOUDS INCREASE TONIGHT. /OUTLOOK FOR KMSP/ WED...VFR. WINDS N 5 KTS. THU...VFR. WINDS NNW 5 TO 10 KTS. FRI...VFR. WINDS NE 5 TO 10 KTS. 
MN...FROST ADVISORY UNTIL 8 AM CDT THIS MORNING FOR MNZ041>043-      047>050-054>057-064.      FROST ADVISORY FROM 1 AM TO 7 AM CDT WEDNESDAY FOR MNZ042>045-      049>053. WI...FROST ADVISORY FROM 1 AM TO 7 AM CDT WEDNESDAY FOR WIZ014>016-      023-025-027-028. 
ISSUED AT 1055 PM CDT MON MAY 18 2015 CEILINGS TO REMAIN GENERALLY AS VFR BUT THERE MAY BE SOME BOUNCING INTO UPPER-END MVFR RANGE OCCASIONALLY AT THE TERMINALS THROUGH DAYBREAK. AS THE DEEP LOW PRES CENTER ROTATES OFF TO THE GREAT LAKES...HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLIDE IN AND ALLOW CLOUDS TO SCATTER OUT...RESULTING IN VFR CONDS BY MIDDAY AND LASTING THROUGH THE REST OF THE TAF PERIOD. ASIDE FROM A FEW ISOLD SPRINKLES IN ERN MN INTO WRN WI...NO PRECIP IS EXPECTED. NW WINDS THROUGHOUT WITH SPEEDS DIMINISHING TO ARND 10 KT OVERNIGHT AND REMAINING THERE THRU TMRW. KMSP...MAINLY VFR CIGS OVERNIGHT BUT A FEW PERIODS OF 2K-3K FT CEILINGS CANNOT BE RULED OUT OVERNIGHT. DECKS WILL THEN RISE TO VFR LEVELS AFTER DAYBREAK. /OUTLOOK FOR KMSP/ WED...VFR. WINDS N 5 KTS. THU...VFR. WINDS NNW 5 TO 10 KTS. FRI...VFR. WINDS NE 5 TO 10 KTS. 
ISSUED AT 106 AM CDT TUE MAY 19 2015 AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE JUST NORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR WILL CONTINUE MOVING NORTHEASTWARDS INTO QUEBEC PROVINCE. BEHIND IT HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE NORTHLAND THROUGH TUESDAY. CIGS WILL VARY BETWEEN VFR/MVFR AT ALL SITES UNTIL AT LEAST 09Z. LAST SEVERAL RAP SOUNDINGS AND LATEST NAM SHOW ALL SITES EXCEPT FOR KHYR REACH VFR CIGS BETWEEN 09Z AND 13Z. KHYR SHOULD REACH VFR CIGS AROUND 16Z. GUSTY WINDS WILL DEVELOP AT KDLH AND KHIB AROUND 13Z. 
ISSUED AT 251 PM CDT MON MAY 18 2015 MAIN CONCERNS IN THE SHORT TERM ARE CENTERED AROUND THE LINGERING RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH AN INCOMING COLD AIR MASS FROM THE NORTH PRODUCING TEMPERATURES 15 TO 20 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL TODAY...TONIGHT AND TOMORROW. STACKED LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CURRENTLY LIFTING NEWD FROM THE TIP OF THE ARROWHEAD INTO ONTARIO AND THE NRN GREAT LAKES THIS AFTERNOON WITH A COLD CANADIAN AIR MASS FILLING IN BEHIND THE DEPARTING SYSTEM ACROSS MUCH OF THE UPPER MIDWEST. THIS STRONG AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WHICH BROUGHT MUCH NEEDED RAIN TO THE REGION THIS PAST WEEKEND IS CONTINUING TO PRODUCE LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS OVER THE AREA TODAY WITH THE COLD AIR MIXING IN ALLOWING FOR A FEW SNOW SHOWERS AS WELL. THE COLD AND WET CONDITIONS ARE ALSO COMBINING WITH GUSTY N/NW WINDS TODAY AS HIGH PRESSURE TO THE WEST AND THE DEEP SYSTEM TO THE EAST INDUCE A TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER NRN MN. HAVE HAD REPORTS OF SUSTAINED WINDS 15 TO 20 MPH...AND GUSTS NEAR OR EXCEEDING 30 MPH. IN CASE YOU FORGOT WHAT FALL FEELS LIKE. PRECIPITATION TRENDS TONIGHT WILL BE DRYING AS THE SYSTEM CONTINUES TO MOVE TO THE EAST AND HIGH PRESSURE AND DRIER AIR MOVE IN OVER THE UPPER MIDWEST. THE GRADIENT WILL ALSO RELAX AS THE HIGH MOVES IN...WHICH WILL ALLOW THE WINDS TO DIMINISH THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT HOURS...BUT REMAIN LIGHT FROM THE N/NW. THE COLD CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST TONIGHT WITH LOWS IN THE UPPER 20S AND 30S OVER MUCH OF THE AREA. A FEW ISOLATED COLDER LOCATIONS INTO THE LOWER TO MID 20S ARE NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION...ESPECIALLY IF CLOUDS MIX OUT OVER N-CENTRAL MN BEFORE SUNRISE TUE MORNING. EXPECTING WEAK LAKE INDUCED CLOUDS AND LIGHT SNOW/DRIZZLE ALONG THE SOUTH SHORE TONIGHT AND EARLY TUE MORNING...BUT WITH ONLY LIGHT AMTS ANTICIPATED. MOST OF THE DAY TUESDAY WILL BE SUNNY ACROSS THE NORTHLAND...BUT WITH THE INFLUENCE FROM THE COLD AIR MASS STILL IN PLACE ONLY ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO REACH INTO THE LOWER TO MID 50S. 
ISSUED AT 1055 PM CDT MON MAY 18 2015 UPDATED TO INCLUDE 06Z AVIATION DISCUSSION BELOW. 
ISSUED AT 640 PM CDT MON MAY 18 2015 THE SHORT TERM CONCERNS ARE EXTENT OF CLEARING OVERNIGHT AND THE POTENTIAL FOR FROST/FREEZE. EXTENSIVE LOW CLOUDS ACROSS THE AREA ASSOCIATED WITH COLD TROUGH EXITING TO THE EAST. STILL COULD SEE AN ISOLATED SHOWER YET INTO THE NORTHERN CWA...THROUGH ABOUT SUNSET. LOWER LEVEL MOISTURE EXPECTED TO REMAIN MUCH OF THE NIGHT...WITH PERHAPS SOME EROSION TO THE EAST AFTER MAINLY 06Z TUE. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWING ANOTHER WEAK SHORT WAVE DROPPING INTO NORTH DAKOTA FROM MANITOBA CANADA...AND MAY BE THE REAL SYSTEM THAT SCOURS LOWER CLOUDS. THE GFS IS MORE PESSIMISTIC IN OVERALL CLOUD COVER THROUGH THE NIGHT. HAVE TRENDED MOSTLY CLOUDY TO THE EAST WITH PERHAPS SOME CLEARING LATE IN THE WEST. STILL EXPECT TO HAVE SOME WIND OVER THE REGION AND THIS ALONG WITH THE EVENTUAL CLOUD COVER WILL DETERMINE AND REAL FROST/FREEZE THREAT. IF WE DO CLEAR EARLIER...THE FREEZE THREAT WILL BECOME ENHANCED TO THE WEST. HAVE OPTED TO GO WITH A FROST ADVISORY OVER MAINLY WEST CENTRAL MINNESOTA OVERNIGHT. WE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR CLOUD/WIND TRENDS INTO THE HE EVENING FOR POSSIBLE EXPANSION OF ADVISORY AREA. ANOTHER COOL DAY IN STORE FORE TUESDAY WITH READINGS WARMING THROUGH THE 50S...LIGHTER WINDS AND MORE SUNSHINE. 
MN...FROST ADVISORY UNTIL 8 AM CDT TUESDAY FOR MNZ041>043-047>050-      054>057-064. WI...NONE. 
ISSUED AT 640 PM CDT MON MAY 18 2015 LOW STRATUS MVFR CEILINGS TO PERSIST THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT HRS AS DEEP LOW PRES CENTER ROTATES ACRS THE AREA INTO THE GREAT LAKES. A WEAK SFC TROF ASSOCIATED WITH THE SFC LOW FEATURE WILL HELP KEEP CLOUDS IN PLACE A LITTLE LONGER INTO TMRW...BUT AM NOT LOOKING FOR IFR CEILINGS OF ANY PROLONGED DURATION. THERE MAY BE SOME POCKETS OF BR/FG THIS EVENING WITH THE TROF...BUT THIS WILL ALSO BE SHORT- LIVED. CONDS WILL IMPROVE DURG THE DAY TMRW AS HIGH PRES ARRIVES FROM THE NW...ALLOWING CLOUDS TO SCATTER OUT AND VFR CONDS TO PREVAIL. GENERALLY NW WINDS THROUGHOUT WITH SPEEDS DIMINISHING TO ARND 10KT TNGT AND REMAINING AROUND THERE THRU TMRW. KMSP...SOLID MVFR CEILINGS TO PREVAIL THRU OVERNIGHT BUT WITH CEILINGS AOA 2K FT...WITH DECKS RISING TO VFR LEVELS AFTER DAYBREAK. ASIDE FROM A FEW INSIGNIFICANT POCKETS OF -DZ/-SHRA THIS EVE...NO PRECIP EXPECTED. /OUTLOOK FOR KMSP/ WED...VFR. WINDS N 5 KTS. THU...VFR. WINDS NNW 5 TO 10 KTS. FRI...VFR. WINDS NE 5 TO 10 KTS. 
MN...FROST ADVISORY FROM 1 AM TO 8 AM CDT TUESDAY FOR MNZ041>043-      047>050-054>057-064. WI...NONE. 
ISSUED AT 630 PM CDT MON MAY 18 2015 THE ENORMOUS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT BROUGHT ALL THE PRECIPITATION TO THE NORTHLAND OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS WILL GRADUALLY LOSE ITS GRIP ON THE REGION OVERNIGHT AND INTO TUESDAY. CLOUD COVER WILL VARY BETWEEN VFR AND MVFR/IFR OVERNIGHT...BUT OVERALL IT WILL SETTLE INTO THE MVFR RANGE AS THE NIGHT WEARS ON. GRADUAL CLEARING WILL DEVELOP ON TUESDAY. GUSTY NORTHERLY WINDS WILL CONTINUE IN SPOTS OVERNIGHT...BUT WILL IMPROVE ON TUESDAY. 
MN...NONE. WI...NONE. LS...SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY UNTIL 7 AM CDT TUESDAY FOR LSZ121-140-      146>148. 
ISSUED AT 111 PM CDT MON MAY 18 2015 EXPECT PREVAILING MVFR CONDITIONS AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OVER THE MINNESOTA ARROWHEAD SLOWLY MOVES EASTWARD. VISIBLE SATELLITE IS SHOWING OCCASIONAL BROKEN CIGS ACROSS CENTRAL MINNESOTA... SO SHORT LIVED VFR CONDITIONS MAY OCCUR OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS... ESPECIALLY AT KHIB AND KBRD. DRIZZLE IS LIKELY AT ALL SITES... WITH OCCASIONAL SNOW SHOWERS MIXING WITH RAIN ACROSS THE KINL/KHIB/KDLH THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING UNTIL 06Z. WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO GUST UP TO 25 KTS OUT OF THE NORTHWEST BEFORE SHIFTING TO THE NORTH AFTER 08Z. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE NORTHLAND TOMORROW MORNING... WHICH WILL BRING VFR CIGS/VIS AFTER 14Z TUESDAY MORNING. 
MN...NONE. WI...NONE. LS...SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY UNTIL 10 PM CDT THIS EVENING FOR LSZ121-      146>148.      SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY UNTIL 4 PM CDT THIS AFTERNOON FOR      LSZ141>145.      SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY UNTIL 4 AM CDT TUESDAY FOR LSZ140. 
ISSUED AT 111 PM CDT MON MAY 18 2015 UPDATED FOR AVIATION FORECAST DISCUSSION BELOW... UPDATE ISSUED AT 908 AM CDT MON MAY 18 2015 ADDED MENTION OF DRIZZLE TODAY AND POSSIBLY FREEZING DRIZZLE TO THE FORECAST FOR TONIGHT. EXTENDED SLIGHT CHANCE OF SLEET AND/OR SNOW FURTHER TO THE SOUTH TODAY AND TONIGHT. OTHERWISE ONLY SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO THE FORECAST. 
ISSUED AT 315 AM  CDT MON MAY 18 2015 EARLY THIS MORNING THE NEARLY VERTICALLY STACKED LOW WAS CENTERED OVER NORTH CENTRAL MINNESOTA. WINDY CONDITIONS AND SNOW SHOWERS WERE OCCURRING ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE LOW OVER NORTH DAKOTA WHERE TEMPERATURES AROUND 30 HAD FALLEN FROM THE MID 50S OF YESTERDAY MORNING. THAT STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL BE COVERING THE NORTHLAND TODAY...TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. THE STRONGEST WILL BE TODAY AND TONIGHT WITH 8H TEMPS IN THE TEENS FALLING TO -8C TO -10C OVERNIGHT. THIS VERY COLD LAYER WILL CREATE STEEP LAPSE RATES...WHICH WILL KEEP SHOWERS GOING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS COLD LAYER WILL THICKEN TO ABOUT A 800 MB WITH A MUCH WARMER LAYER ALOFT TONIGHT...BUT THE COLD LAYER WILL BE COLD ENOUGH TO GENERATE SNOW SNOW CRYSTALS...MEANING SNOW IN THE FORECAST. WITH THE VERY WET GROUND...DO NOT EXPECT ACCUMULATIONS. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN TUESDAY...WITH SUBSIDENCE AND DRYING. BUT LAKE EFFECT SHOWERS COULD CONTINUE NEAR THE WI/MI BORDER. 
ISSUED AT 352 AM CDT MON MAY 18 2015 SUB-1000MB LOW OVER NORTHERN MN CONTINUES TO FACILITATE WINDY CONDITIONS AND STRATUS CLOUDS OVER THE FORECAST AREA EARLY THIS MORNING. SLIGHT LOOSENING OF THE PRESSURE GRADIENT AS THE TROUGH WEAKENS AND LIFTS TO THE GREAT LAKES SHOULD ALLOW WINDS TO DIP BELOW WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA TODAY /SUSTAINED 30 MPH/...SO WILL NOT REISSUE THE WIND ADVISORY. HOWEVER...IT WILL REMAIN QUITE BREEZY THROUGH THE DAY. MEANWHILE...THE EXTENSIVE AREA OF SHOWERS OVER NORTHERN MN AND THE EASTERN DAKOTAS WILL SLIP SLIGHTLY FARTHER SOUTH INTO CENTRAL MN THIS MORNING. HAVE MAINTED HIGH CHANCE POPS ACROSS CENTRAL MN TOWARD NORTHERN WI...AND ALSO INCLUDED SPRINKLES FARTHER SOUTH TO INCLUDE THE TWIN CITIES AND AREAS DOWN TOWARD SOUTH CENTRAL MN. TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL BE QUITE CHILLY...AVERAGING 25 TO 30 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. HIGHS WILL STRUGGLE TO REACH 40 IN WEST CENTRAL MN NEAR ALEXANDRIA...WHILE THE REMAINDER OF THE AREA WILL SEE HIGHS IN THE 40S. TEMPS TONIGHT WILL BE AROUND 10 TO 15 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL...WITH ANTICIPATED LOWS IN THE LOW TO MID 30S. HAVE INCLUDED THE MENTION OF FROST IN THE FORECAST...BUT WILL HOLD OFF ON ANY SORT OF A FROST/FREEZE ADVISORY GIVEN SCT-BKN CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO HANG IN UNTIL THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF TUESDAY...AND WINDS WILL BE IN THE 6-10 MPH RANGE. 
ISSUED AT 1257 PM CDT MON MAY 18 2015 WIDESPREAD MVFR CIGS ACROSS THE AREA. SOME RESIDUAL SPRINKLES/LIGHT SHOWERS AROUND. STILL HAVE COLD POOL TO MOVE OVER THE AREA INTO TONIGHT.THE HRRR CONTINUES TO SHOW SOME ISOLD -SHRA INTO TONIGHT AS WEAK SURFACE TROUGH MOVES SOUTHEAST OVER THE NORTHERN CWA. THIS MAY AFFECT CLOUD TRENDS...ESPECIALLY TO THE EAST OVERNIGHT. SOME DRIER AIR TRYING TO WORK OVER SOUTHWEST AREA...WITH MORE CUFORM CLOUDS THIS AFTERNOON. MAY SEE HIGHER END MVFR OR IFR CONDITIONS AT A FEW LOCATIONS IN MN THIS AFTERNOON. WILL TRY AND SCATTERED CLOUDS TO THE WEST OVERNIGHT AS DRIER AIR MOVES EAST. THEY MAY HOLD FIRM FARTHER EAST...BUT OVERALL CONFIDENCE IN CLOUD TREND IS LOW AT THIS TIME. WEST TO NORTHWEST WINDS OVER THE AREA GUSTS OVER 30KT TO THE WEST...SHOULD GRADUALLY DIMINISH INTO THE EVENING FROM WEST TO EAST. NORTHWEST/NORTH WINDS GENERALLY 10-15 KTS INTO TUE WITH CLEARING TREND. KMSP... MVFR CIGS INTO THE NIGHT WITH VFR TRENDS INTO TUESDAY MORNING. SOME QUESTION AS TO HOW LOW CIGS MAY DROP AGAIN INTO THE HE EVENING AS A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH APPROACHES FROM THE NORTH. WILL HAVE TO MONITOR THIS INTO THE EVENING. SOME SMALL CHANCE OF -RA/-DZ ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FEATURE AS WELL...BUT FORCING IS LACKING. NORTHWEST WINDS A BIT GUSTY INTO THE EVENING BECOMING MORE NORTH INTO TUESDAY. /OUTLOOK FOR KMSP/ WED...VFR. WINDS N 5 KTS. THU...VFR. WINDS NNW 5 TO 10 KTS. FRI...VFR. WINDS NE 5 TO 10 KTS. 
MN...NONE. WI...NONE. 
ISSUED AT 908 AM CDT MON MAY 18 2015 ADDED MENTION OF DRIZZLE TODAY AND POSSIBLY FREEZING DRIZZLE TO THE FORECAST FOR TONIGHT. EXTENDED SLIGHT CHANCE OF SLEET AND/OR SNOW FURTHER TO THE SOUTH TODAY AND TONIGHT. OTHERWISE ONLY SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO THE FORECAST. 
ISSUED AT 713 AM CDT MON MAY 18 2015 IFR/LOW END MVFR WILL OCCUR THROUGH MUCH OF THE PERIOD. RAIN...AND POSSIBLY SOME SNOW ACROSS FAR NORTHERN AREAS...WILL BE MOST WIDESPREAD THIS MORNING THEN GRADUALLY DIMINISH IN COVERAGE THIS AFTERNOON INTO THIS EVENING. MAINLY MVFR CEILINGS WILL OCCUR TONIGHT...ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE SOME CLEARING FAR NORTH LATE. GUSTY WINDS WILL OCCUR AS WELL TODAY...DIMINISHING TONIGHT. 
MN...NONE. WI...NONE. LS...SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY UNTIL 4 PM CDT THIS AFTERNOON FOR LSZ121-      140>148. 
ISSUED AT 644 AM CDT MON MAY 18 2015 STRATUS CLOUDS WITH MVFR CIGS WILL PREVAIL THROUGH THE PERIOD...ALONG WITH WINDY CONDITIONS. A FEW BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS ARE POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON...BUT AN OTHERWISE CLOUDY PERIOD IS EXPECTED. SHOWERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPARTING TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL PIVOT ACROSS CENTRAL MN/WI TODAY. PRECIP WILL BE SPOTTY IN NATURE WITH VFR VISIBILITIES...SO VCSH IS ADEQUATE AT NORTHERN/EASTERN SITES. SUSTAINED NORTHWEST WINDS AT 17-25KTS WITH GUSTS TO BETWEEN 30 AND 35 KTS WILL BE COMMON...WITH GUSTS SUBSIDING AFTER DARK TONIGHT BUT NOT TOTALLY DIMINISHING. KMSP... CIGS BETWEEN 2KFT-2500FT THROUGH THE PERIOD...WITH A FEW BREAKS POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON. GUSTY WEST WINDS SHIFT TO THE NORTHWEST THIS MORNING. A FEW SHOWERS IN THE VICINITY OF THE AIRPORT ARE POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON...BUT PROBABILITY/COVERAGE/IMPACT ARE TOO LOW TO MENTION IN THE TAF. /OUTLOOK FOR KMSP/ WED...VFR. WINDS N 5 KTS. THU...VFR. WINDS NNW 5 TO 10 KTS. FRI...VFR. WINDS NE 5 TO 10 KTS. 
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
ISSUED AT 1241 AM CDT MON MAY 18 2015 A STRENGTHENING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER NORTHERN MINNESOTA WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE TAF SITES THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. CONDITIONS OVERNIGHT AND INTO MONDAY WILL GENERALLY BE MVFR TO IFR WITH REGARD TO CIGS AND VSBYS. SOME GUSTY SOUTHWEST WINDS CAN BE EXPECTED AT SOUTHERN SITES OVERNIGHT...WITH GUSTY NORTHEAST WINDS NORTH OF THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AT KINL. OVERALL THE WINDS WILL CHANGE TO THE NORTH TO NORTHWEST AND THEY WILL BE GUSTY AT TIMES DURING THE DAY MONDAY. CIGS/VSBYS WILL GRADUALLY IMPROVE THROUGH THE DAY AND ESPECIALLY INTO THE EVENING...WHEN MVFR TO VFR IS EXPECTED. 
ISSUED AT 315 AM  CDT MON MAY 18 2015 EARLY THIS MORNING THE NEARLY VERTICALLY STACKED LOW WAS CENTERED OVER NORTH CENTRAL MINNESOTA. WINDY CONDITIONS AND SNOW SHOWERS WERE OCCURRING ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE LOW OVER NORTH DAKOTA WHERE TEMPERATURES AROUND 30 HAD FALLEN FROM THE MID 50S OF YESTERDAY MORNING. THAT STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL BE COVERING THE NORTHLAND TODAY...TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. THE STRONGEST WILL BE TODAY AND TONIGHT WITH 8H TEMPS IN THE TEENS FALLING TO -8C TO -10C OVERNIGHT. THIS VERY COLD LAYER WILL CREATE STEEP LASPSE REATES...WHICH WILL KEEP SHOWERS GOING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS COLD LAYER WILL THICKEN TO ABOUT A 800 MB WWITH A MUCH WARMER LAYER ALOFT TONIGHT...BUT THE COLD LAYER WILL BE COLD ENOUGH TO GENERATE SNOW SNOW CRYSTALS...MEANING SNOW IN THE FORECAST. WITH THE VERY WET GROUND...DO NOT EXPECT ACCUMULATIONS. HIGH PRESURE WILL BUILD IN TUESDAY...WITH SUBSIDENCE AND DRYING. BUT LAKE EFFECT SHOWERS COULD CONTINUE NEAR THE WI/MI BORDER. 
ISSUED AT 314 PM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015 MAIN CONCERNS IN THE SHORT TERM REMAIN FOCUSED AROUND THE POTENTIAL FOR STRONG TO POSSIBLY SEVERE STORMS ACROSS THE NORTHLAND. WARM FRONT HAS LIFTED INTO NORTHEAST MN THIS AFTERNOON AND A WELL DEFINED DRY SLOT HAS WORKED ITS WAY FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS IN ACROSS MUCH OF MINNESOTA. VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATING THIS DRY AIR MIXING INTO THE BOUNDARY LAYER AND ALLOWING THE CLOUD COVER TO DISSIPATE OVER MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS WILL LEAD TO FASTER DESTABILIZATION OF THE MIXED LAYER AND MORE FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT OF CONVECTION IN THE WARM SECTOR THROUGH THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. TIGHTLY WRAPPED SFC LOW AND NEARLY CO-LOCATED UPPER LOW CONTINUE TO SPIN OVER NERN SOUTH DAKOTA THIS AFTERNOON WITH BANDS OF WEAK CONVECTION SPINNING OFF TO THE NORTH AND NE THROUGH CENTRAL MN. AS THE BOUNDARY LAYER BECOMES MORE UNSTABLE A FEW OF THESE STORMS WILL INTENSIFY AND POTENTIALLY PRODUCE HAIL...DAMAGING WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN. THE SFC AND UPPER LOW WILL MOVE TO THE NE INTO WRN ONTARIO TONIGHT AND CONTINUE TO SPREAD RAIN SHOWERS AND WEAK STORMS THROUGH THE EVENING...AND EVENTUALLY BECOME MAINLY RAIN SHOWERS AFTER MIDNIGHT. THE BULK OF THE RAIN TONIGHT WILL BE CONFINED TO AREAS NORTH OF HIGHWAY 2 ALONG AND JUST NORTH/NW OF THE LOW TRACK WITH THE COLD/DRY AIR WRAPPING IN FROM THE W/SW AROUND THE LOW. TEMPERATURES WILL BEGIN TO FALL THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT HOURS INTO THE 40S. 
ISSUED AT 412 PM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015 THUNDERSTORMS HAVE BECOME FAIRLY WIDESPREAD THIS AFTERNOON TO THE EAST OF A COLD FRONT THAT IS ADVANCING EAST ACROSS MN. THE SFC LOW DRIVING THIS FRONT WAS DOWN TO 995 MB AND SPINNING RATHER AGGRESSIVELY ACROSS NE SODAK. BASED ON SFC PRESSURE FALLS...THIS LOW WILL BE ON ITS WAY OFF TO THE ARROWHEAD TONIGHT. WE HAVE QUITE THE CONTRAST IN AIRMASSES ACROSS THE SYSTEM...WITH SUMMER-LIKE AIR TO ITS EAST WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE 70S AND DEWPS IN THE 60S...WHILE WEST OF THE LOW...TEMPERATURES ARE DOWN IN THE MID 30S ACROSS NODAK. IN FACT...IT IS COLD ENOUGH ON THE WRN EDGE OF THE PRECIP SHIELD THAT WE ARE SEEING A RAIN/SNOW MIX THIS AFTERNOON. FOR THE REST OF TODAY...LIKE THE IDEA THAT THE HRRR HAS BEEN RUNNING WITH ALL DAY THAT MATCHES WELL WITH REALITY NOW. AND THAT IS FOR THE WIDESPREAD DISCRETE CELLS TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE EVENING AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. WE HAVE SEEN SBCAPE INCREASE TO BETWEEN 1000 AND 1500 J/KG...BUT WITH LITTLE CIN IN PLACE...WE ARE BASICALLY POPPING CONVECTION AS SOON AS INSTABILITY DEVELOPS. MID-LEVEL LAPSE RATES ARE PRETTY WEAK THOUGH...WHICH IS A BIG LIMITING FACTOR IN THE SVR. STILL...FREEZING LEVELS HAVE DROPPED FROM ALMOST 12K FT AGL YESTERDAY TO BETWEEN 8K AND 9K FEET TODAY...WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR THE THREAT FOR MARGINALLY SVR HAIL THROUGH THE EVENING. GIVEN THE DEPTH OF THE SYSTEM IN TO OUR NW...WE ARE SEEING LOTS OF WIND THROUGH PRETTY MUCH THE WHOLE DEPTH OF THE ATMO...SO THESE SHOWERS WILL LIKELY BE ABLE TO MIX SOME OF THAT DOWN...LEADING TO SOME GUSTY WINDS AS WELL. TORNADO THREAT DOES NOT LOOK AS GOOD AS YESTERDAY...WHEN WE HAD A WARM FRONT DRAPED ACROSS THE STATE...BUT THE RAP HAS BEEN SHOWING 0-1 SHEAR INCREASING LATE THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS ERN MN/WRN WI...WHERE THE BEST CHANCE FOR SEEING A BRIEF TORNADO WOULD EXIST. FOR TONIGHT...THE BIG THING WE WILL SEE IS STRONG CAA AS THE LOW PUSHES TOWARD THE ARROWHEAD. THIS WILL LEAD TO SOME AGGRESSIVE TEMPERATURE DROPS OVERNIGHT...WHERE LOWS IN WRN MN WILL FALL BACK INTO THE MID 30S...OR ABOUT 35 DEGREES COLDER THAN THE HIGHS WERE THIS AFTERNOON. IN ADDITION TO THE COLD AIR...WE WILL SEE WRAP AROUND PRECIP DIP DOWN ABOUT AS FAR SOUTH AS A MADISON TO MILLE LACS LAKE LINE. FORECAST SOUNDINGS IN THIS AREA ARE ALSO COLD ENOUGH TO SHOW A RAIN/SLEET MIX DEVELOPING LATE TONIGHT. IN FACT...THE NAM WOULD SAY THE P-TYPE AT AXN WILL BE ALL SLEET TOMORROW MORNING...SO DID INTRODUCE A PRECIP MIX INTO THE GRIDS. BESIDE THE PRECIP...WINDS WILL BE STRONG AS WELL. TOP OF THE CHANNEL MIX DOWN AT MOST SITES IN MN IS OVER 40 KTS. WE ARE RIGHT ON THE CUSP OF NEEDING A WIND ADVY...BUT DECIDED TO HOLD OFF ON ONE FOR NOW AND WILL LET THE SEVERE POTENTIAL PLAY OUT BEFORE HOISTING A WIND ADVY. FOR MONDAY...THERE IS NO WAY AROUND IT...IT WILL BE A RAW DAY. NAM HAS H85 TEMPS DROPPING TO BETWEEN -5 AND -8C...WHICH IS BELOW THE CLIMATOLOGICAL RECORD FOR H85 TEMPS FOR THE DAY AT STC/MPX. THROW IN THE MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES...AND HAVE HIGH CONFIDENCE IN HIGHS STAYING IN THE 40S...WITH HIGHS ONLY IN THE 30S OUT TOWARD AXN. THESE VALUES WILL BE IN THE 25 TO 35 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL RANGE. 
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
MN...WIND ADVISORY UNTIL 4 AM CDT MONDAY FOR MNZ047-054>056-064-065-      073-074-082-091. WI...NONE. 
ISSUED AT 700 PM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015 SCATTERED SHOWERS AND WEAK THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE IN EASTERN MN THROUGH ABOUT 01-02Z AND ABOUT 04Z IN WESTERN WI. THERE WILL BE SEVERAL HOURS OF VFR IN MN /LONGER IN WI/ BEFORE AN MVFR STRATUS DECK MOVES IN LATE THIS EVENING AND TONIGHT AND LINGERS THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW. IFR IS POSSIBLE ACROSS PORTIONS OF CENTRAL MN...BUT MOST OF THE TAF SITES SHOULD REMAIN BETWEEN 1500-2500FT FOR CLOUD BASES. KMSP... THERE ARE A FEW SHOWERS TO THE WEST OF KMSP...WHICH WILL BE IN THE VICINITY FOR THE NEXT 1-2 HOURS BEFORE THE DRIER AIR TAKES OVER AND SHUTS DOWN THE PRECIP CHANCES. OTHERWISE...WE HAVE MEDIUM TO HIGH CONFIDENCE OF 2000-2200FT CEILINGS AT THE AIRPORT BEFORE THE MONDAY MORNING COMMUTE...BUT WE ARE NOT TOO CONFIDENT THEY WILL BE BELOW 1700FT. WE SHOULD HAVE A MUCH BETTER IDEA AT THE 06Z AND 09Z UPDATES. /OUTLOOK FOR KMSP/ TUE...MVFR CIGS POSSIBLE EARLY. WINDS N AT 10 KTS. WED...VFR. WINDS N 5 KTS. THU...VFR. WINDS NNW 5 TO 10 KTS. FRI...VFR. WINDS VARIABLE 0 TO 5 KTS. 
ISSUED AT 640 PM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015 A LARGE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST OVERNIGHT AND INTO MONDAY. THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE COMMON THIS EVENING...BEFORE THE MODE OF PRECIPITATION WILL CHANGE TO RAIN SHOWERS. BY 12Z MONDAY THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BE OVER NORTH CENTRAL MINNESOTA. NUMEROUS SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH THE TAF SITES. CONFIDENCE IN ANY PARTICULAR VALUES IS ACTUALLY KIND OF LOW...AS THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE LAYERS OF CLOUDS MOVING THROUGH THE REGION DUE TO THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM STRENGTHENING IN PLACE. OVERALL WE SHOULD SEE A VFR/MVFR EVENING SETTLE INTO A MAINLY MVFR NIGHT AND MVFR/VFR ON MONDAY. NEAR LAKE SUPERIOR WE ARE EXPECTED TO SEE SOME FOG LINGER INTO THE EVENING WITH IFR/LIFR CONDITIONS AT TIMES. 
ISSUED AT 125 PM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015 LIKE THE IDEA OF THE HRRR...WITH WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING THIS AFTERNOON AS THE STACKED LOW MOVES THROUGH MN WITH MARGINAL INSTABILITY BUT VIRTUALLY NO CIN. DECIDED TO CONTINUE TREND OF HANDLING THIS SCENARIO WITH VC GROUPS AND EXTENDED TEMPO GROUPS FOR THUNDER. HAVE HIGH CONFIDENCE IN STORMS OCCURRING...JUST LOW CONFIDENCE ON TIMING/TRACKS OF THE NUMEROUS STORMS THAT ARE EXPECTED. AS WE GET BEHIND THE COLD FRONT...LOW STRATUS BACK OVER THE DAKOTAS WILL SWING THROUGH...WITH TIMING ON ITS ARRIVAL NOT TOO DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE HRRR/SREF/NAM/LAMP...SO MAIN ISSUE WITH THAT IS MORE HOW LOW WILL IT BE AS OPPOSED TO WHEN WILL THOSE CLOUDS GET TO EACH AIRPORT. MAIN CHANGE MADE TO THE PREVIOUS TAF WAS TO GO WITH MORE WINDS GIVEN STRENGTH OF MIXED LAYER WINDS ON NAM SOUNDINGS...WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE SOME WIND GUSTS IN WRN MN TONIGHT THROUGH MON MORNING GET INTO THE 40S KTS. KMSP...ALREADY SEEING SHOWERS BUBBLE UP AT 18Z...AND THINKING THIS THEME OF SCT SHOWERS/STORMS WILL BE WITH US THROUGH ABOUT 1Z. TEMPO GROUP FOR THUNDER IS BASED ON WHEN THE HRRR BRINGS THE GREATEST COVERAGE OF STORMS THROUGH. ALSO HAVE HIGH CONFIDENCE IN MVFR CIGS RETURNING TONIGHT. THOUGH HAVE KEPT CIGS ABOVE 017...MAY CIGS GET DOWN BETWEEN 010-015 DURING THE MORNING ON MONDAY. WINDS COULD ALSO BE PROBLEMATIC MONDAY MORNING...WITH STRONG CROSS WINDS EXPECTED IN THE EARLY MORNING BEFORE WINDS CONTINUE TO VEER MORE TOWARD A 300 DIRECTION IN THE AFTERNOON. /OUTLOOK FOR KMSP/ TUE...MVFR CIGS EARLY. WINDS N AT 10 KTS. WED...VFR. WINDS NNE 5 KTS. THU...VFR. WINDS NNW 5 KTS. 
ISSUED AT 317 PM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015 MAINLY MVFR CONDITIONS ACROSS ALL TAF SITES WITH IFR-LIFR CONDITIONS POSSIBLE WITH SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING.  THE WINDS WILL SWITCH AS A COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE REGION LATE TONIGHT.  CONDITIONS WILL DROP TO MVFR-IFR IN RAIN SHOWERS AND FOG THROUGH MID-MORNING MONDAY.  CONDITIONS SHOULD IMPROVE BY AFTERNOON. 
SKIES ARE CLEARING OUT ACROSS THE AREA LATE THIS MORNING AS A PRONOUNCED MID-LEVEL DRY SLOT TODAY. BIGGEST CHANGE SEEN WITH THE SEVERE THREAT TODAY IS IT IS NOT LOOKING AS GREAT. THE BIGGEST REASON IS INSTABILITY LOOKS MARGINAL TODAY...WITH MLCAPES LARGELY STAYING UNDER 1000 J/KG. THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS WE HAVE BROAD FORCING WITH THE UPPER WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE REGION WITH AN UNCAPPED ENVIRONMENT. THE LIMITED CAPPING MEANS AS SOON AS A LITTLE BIT OF INSTABILITY IS ACHIEVED...CONVECTION WILL BE INITIATED...WHICH WILL QUICKLY START TO CONSUME ANY CAPE PRESENT. GIVEN THE LOW LEVEL WIND FIELDS...STRONG WINDS WILL LIKELY BE THE MAIN THREAT...WITH THE TORNADO THREAT INCREASING SOME THIS AFTERNOON AS O-1KM INCREASES AHEAD OF THE EWRD ADVANCING COLD FRONT. 
ISSUED AT 405 AM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015 THE EXTENDED PERIOD CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AS MAINLY DRY AND UNSEASONABLY COOL FOR AT LEAST THE FIRST TWO DAYS /MONDAY AND TUESDAY/...WITH POSSIBLY MORE PRECIPITATION BY NEXT WEEKEND. MONDAY MORNING THE INTENSE SFC LOW WILL BEGIN TO FILL AND MOVE OFF TO THE NORTHEAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES. WRAP AROUND MOISTURE WILL BE CONFINED TO CENTRAL/NORTHERN MN WHERE THE HIGHEST POPS WILL BE LOCATED. HOWEVER...SOME SPRINKLES COULD MOVE INTO SOUTHERN MN/WC WI DUE TO COLD AIR ALOFT AND RESIDUAL MOISTURE NEAR THE AREA. STANDARD 85H/92H TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES ARE 2-4 BLW NORMAL BY MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT WHICH TRANSLATES TO SFC TEMPS NEARLY 20-30 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. EVEN THE GEFS/NAEFS MEAN 85H TEMPS RETURN INTERVAL BASED ON CLIMATOLOGY /1985 - 2012/ ARE ONCE EVERY 10 YEARS FOR THESE TYPE OF TEMPS FOR MID MAY. EVEN SOME AREAS IN THE NORTHERN PLAINS ARE OUTSIDE CLIMATOLOGY NORMS WHICH MEANS SOME RECORD LOWS ARE POSSIBLE EARLY NEXT WEEK BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVER AND SFC WINDS. THE MEAN UPPER FLOW WILL BE WEST/NW ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST AS AN UPPER RIDGE HOLDS ACROSS WESTERN CANADA...AND AN UPPER LOW BUILDS SOUTHWARD ACROSS HUDSON BAY BY MIDWEEK. THE MEAN UPPER FLOW ACROSS THE WESTERN AND SOUTHERN PART OF THE CONUS WILL BE MORE PROGRESSIVE WITH SEVERAL STORM SYSTEMS AFFECTING THAT REGION. NOT UNTIL LATE IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD...POSSIBLY AS LATE AS SATURDAY/SUNDAY WILL WE GET INTO A MORE PROGRESSIVE FLOW FROM THE SW AS THE UPPER RIDGE BREAKS DOWN IN WESTERN CANADA AND AN UPPER LOW MOVES INLAND INTO THE SW CONUS. TEMPS WILL SLOWLY MODERATE BY THE END OF THE WEEK WITH 60S/70S MOVING BACK INTO THE REGION. 
ISSUED AT 113 PM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015 HAVE ALLOWED THE DENSE FOG ADVISORY TO EXPIRE DUE TO THE RAPID IMPROVEMENT OF VISIBILITIES IN THE FOG AROUND THE TWIN PORTS THIS AFTERNOON. STILL COULD BE POCKETS OF LIGHT 1 TO 4 SM FOG THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY AROUND LAKE SUPERIOR. REST OF THE SHORT TERM FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK WITH CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OVER CENTRAL MN IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS AND MOVEMENT N/NEWD INTO THE NORTHLAND IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. STILL EXPECTING A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE STORMS. 
ISSUED AT 317 AM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015 AN UPPER LEVEL CLOSED LOW WAS MOVING THROUGH NEBRASKA AT 07Z. PIECES OF SHORT WAVE ENERGY WERE LIFTING NWD FROM THE BASE OF THE LOW TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA. MEANWHILE...THE SFC LOW CENTER WAS IN CENTRAL SD WITH A STATIONARY FRONT ACROSS SOUTHERN MN AND SOUTHERN WI. A WEAK SFC TROF WAS LOCATED OVER WESTERN LAKE SUPERIOR INTO NW WI. SHOWERS AND ISOLD THUNDERSTORMS WERE PERCOLATING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. EXPECT THE CLOSED UPPER LOW TO REACH THE SD BORDER WITH NEBRASKA BY 12Z WHILE THE SFC LOW HEADS TOWARD SW MN. SOME SHORT WAVE ENERGY REACHES SW MN WITH THE SFC LOW AND MORE SHOWERS AND STORMS. THE UPPER AND SFC LOWS BECOME OCCLUDED BY 18Z ALONG THE MN/DAKOTAS BORDER. A LLJ WILL BE PUSHING MOISTURE LADEN AIR INTO THE AREA. WITH MORE IMPULSES OF ENERGY LIFTING INTO THE REGION...STORMS WILL BECOME MORE NUMEROUS...ESPECIALLY OVER THE FAR WESTERN EDGE OF THE AREA. A DRY SLOT WILL BE FOUND TO THE EAST OF THIS ACTIVITY INTO THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE AREA. IF THE SUN IS ABLE TO BREAK THROUGH WITH THIS DRY SLOT...STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS ARE POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY FROM SOUTHERN PINE COUNTY EWD TO PRICE COUNTY WI. AS THIS OCCLUDED SYSTEM REACHES NW MN BY 00Z MONDAY...STORMS WILL BE WIDESPREAD WITH SEVERE POSSIBLE OVER MUCH OF THE REGION. LARGE HAIL...DAMAGING WINDS AND HEAVY RAIN ARE ANTICIPATED. FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE IS RELATIVELY HIGH IN NW WI AND NOT EXPECTING ANY FLOODING. PONDING OF WATER ON ROADWAYS WILL OCCUR WITH DITCHES/CULVERTS POSSIBLY FILLING UP. THE OCCLUDED SYSTEM SLOWLY CROSSES NORTHERN MN TONIGHT. THE LLJ IS MOVING TO THE EAST OF THE AREA AND THE BEST FORCING WILL NOW BE LOCATED ON THE NORTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE SFC LOW. HAVE THE HIGHEST POPS IN THE VCNTY OF THE SFC LOW CENTER...TRENDING DOWNWARD TO THE SE OVERNIGHT. STILL ANTICIPATING THUNDERSTORMS IN THE EVENING AS SUGGESTED BY THERMODYNAMIC PROFILES. AFTER 06Z...THE THUNDER WILL END WITH SHOWERS DOTTING THE LANDSCAPE. WILL BE DRY IN NORTH CENTRAL WI WHERE DRIER AIR HAS BEEN PULLED IN BEHIND A COLD FRONT THAT MOVES THROUGH THE REGION. ON MONDAY...THE SFC LOW BEGINS TO PULL AWAY FROM THE UPPER LOW AS MUCH COLDER AIR SURGES INTO THE AREA. STRONG CAA WITH H85 TEMPS DROPPING THROUGH THE SINGLE DIGITS BELOW ZERO. SOME SNOW SHOWERS/SLEET ARE EXPECTED TO MIX INTO THE NORTHERN THIRD ALONG THE CANADIAN BORDER. NO ACCUMULATION IS ANTICIPATED. LIGHT RAIN ELSEWHERE. MAX TEMPS WILL BE VERY COLD WITH 40S EXPECTED...TO NEAR 50 OVER NORTH CENTRAL WI. 
ISSUED AT 628 AM CDT SUN MAY 17 2015 IFR/MVFR CONDITIONS COVERED MUCH OF THE NORTHLAND WITH AREAS OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS MOVING THROUGH. THE SHOWERS/STORMS WERE MOST NUMEROUS OVER NORTHERN MINNESOTA AND THAT WILL CONTINUE THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY. TIMING THE SHOWERS/STORMS IS A CHALLENGE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE THROUGH THE DAY. OVERALL...WE EXPECT COVERAGE TO BE HIGHEST OVER FAR NORTHERN MINNESOTA...AND LOWEST OVER NORTHERN WISCONSIN. NORTHERN WISCONSIN WILL SEE THUNDERSTORMS BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING. THERE IS A RISK OF SEVERE STORMS ACROSS ALL AREAS THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING...BUT IT IS HIGHEST FROM PINE COUNTY IN MINNESOTA ACROSS MUCH OF NORTHERN WISCONSIN. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TIMING OF THE PRECIP WILL OCCUR THROUGH THE PERIOD. MVFR/IFR CEILINGS THIS MORNING WILL RISE A BIT THIS AFTERNOON...THEN SHOULD COME BACK DOWN TONIGHT. AREAS AROUND LAKE SUPERIOR WILL SEE FOG...DENSE AT TIMES...INTO TONIGHT.
