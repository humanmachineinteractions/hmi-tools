Let's read a story.
I don't want to be all dating people with a high tendency to give themselves concussions.
Come on!This is not to say that it's bad for people to be having fun in their dating profiles.
I'm not saying that.
I wouldn't say that.
Here's what I'm saying: Why are you wearing the exact same expression in all your profile photos?
If you're going to Catfish me with your imaginary e-life, can you at least endeavor to do it via a variety of relatable facial expressions?
I mean, do all these people just walk around terrifying people with their maniacal smiles all day?
There just has to be more to life than smiling at brunch and going to Giants games, you guys.
I want to see photos of you stressing out about whether or not you need to file your taxes in multiple states this year.
Does post-move income qualify in the state of your residence or the state your employer is based in?
I want to hear about your boring job.
Tell me about how boring your job is, Linda!
I want to know not just that you love David Bowie, but also that you're embarrassed because the only album you know of his is one Best of CD and you think that album is the shit.
These are the delicious little details about people that make us ... people.
As opposed to on-stage personas we use to portray ourselves on online media.But I get it.
I get it, you guys.
We all want to put our best face forward, perhaps most of all when it comes to possible future sex-times with strangers.
The problem is that in today's online dating you see a lot more about a person than just their face.
So if we want to engage with each other in any meaningful way, we're going to need more than just face.
We need a head.
With some hair.
Unnecessarily confident.
Slightly tall.
You probably won't notice.
Very smiley when not completely dead in the face.
Making people laugh.
Not here, not in this profile.
You 'll have to meet me in person to see if I'm really funny assuming you can convince yourself I'm not a spambot or internet murderer.
I'm really good at not being a spambot or internet murderer.Also, not sex see above.
Sex is in there.
Food.
Family.
Let's keep some of those things separate.Watching pinball tutorial videos in bed while still wearing jeans and a hoodie.
We can do it, Internet.
Just don't show up: This is only for use once.
I don't know.
I'm not sure if there was an actual game like that.
All you do is just miss work -- no call, no e-mail, no warning or explanation of any kind.
This is only good for one day, though.
The key is to return the next day pretending that nothing is wrong.
In fact, you can even mention to a co-worker that you had the day off.
Then, people start to assume that you were supposed to be gone.
Chances are, everyone will forget you were gone anyway when you bring in snacks.
Everyone loves snacks.
A big congratulations to anyone who has completed their rehabilitation course with success.
Although, a grand event would require an addict to never relapse to their addiction.
If the rehabilitation is an uphill task, then the aftermath seems much tougher.
It is common to observe that addicts succumb into a relapse after initial recovery.
Strong after-care procedures when devised with care prevent the vicious cycle of relapse.
No matter what the kind of crisis be, a strong human support beats all odds.
This adage is universal and works the same for all forms of life on this planet.
Hence, using it to prevent a situation of relapse is the least one could do for themselves.
They could be your family, friends or acquaintances turned friends from a rehab facility.
As long as they inhibit you from getting re-addicted, they form your strong support.
It is important to have someone put you into their surveillance to avoid a relapse.
Many a times, opening up about your urges to your family can bring a big difference.
Addiction being destructive damages the career along with other mayhem it plays.
Due to that, an addict in his stages after recovery finds a lot of free time.
It may turn out a leisure time for some, but for many it may not.
For those few, the empty time in hand could lead to damage.
For an instance, one could get into a depressed state of mind which could lead to a relapse.
Hence, the best way to use the time in hand would be to indulge in something positive.
Else, the idle mindset would lead to complacency and then further damages.
As described in the above point, a feeling of depression destroys it all.
To put it simple, a negative feeling creates a mental pain to the addict.
To deal with it, they relapse into the cycle of getting re-addicted.
So, the sure shot ways to avoid such a situation is to be happy.
I know it sounds way easier than it is, but the onus of it lies to an individual themselves.
Having stated that, one must take the responsibility of one's own happiness.
Avoiding negative memories, company of addicted friends are all ways to deal with it.
The sooner one gets practical on making happiness a routine, the better it is for them.
Drugs not only play with the mental state, but also deplete the physical health.
An addiction destroys the immunity, vital organs and the ability to think rational.
These are just the few of the damages endowed, the list could actually go till lengths.
So one has to follow a regime of proper nutrition to regain vigor and vitality.
Along with that keeping the mental state stable with meditation and yoga does wonders.
It puts one off the thoughts that trigger relapses.
By sticking to a balanced and healthy life regime, a long-term sobriety is achievable.
In the genre of addiction, who could be better than a rehab staff for guidance.
Most of the recovery facilities provide an after-care program for their patients.
It enables the patients to get in touch with them in need of the hour.
Many centers send monthly mailers or stay-in-touch cards to their past patients.
Those interactive gestures act as a safe haven for the addicts who live a life of recluse.
It creates a mental satisfaction that someone is there for them.
That in itself is a strong emotion that can fight the pangs of re-addiction.

My son started tee ball this year and on Saturday he played his fourth game.
Some asshole driving a Suburban couldn't find a parking spot so they parked their vehicle in left field.
Ok, which of those happened and which didn't?
Give up?
Well, it's a trick question.
None of that actually happened but tee ball is so crazy that it wouldn't surprise me at all if any of those happened during his next game.
I feel like I'm watching The Real World when I'm out there at a game.
Crying, fighting, swearing, altercations ... all of it happens.
The only thing missing is binge drinking.
If you were one of the unfortunate ones who dropped $ 100 on the Mayweather/Pacquiao fight, I 've got some advice to you.
Screw real boxing.
Go to a tee ball game.
There are more punches thrown on the field during three innings of tee ball than in 12 rounds of boxing.
One kid hits a ground ball to the infield and suddenly five infielders are all diving for it and punching and kicking each other until someone comes up with it.
It's like recovering a fumble in football.
These kids are real chippy, too.
I was coaching first base and the base runner just turned around for no reason and knocked the hat off the other.
Next thing you know there's retaliation.
Here's some video of his last game I shot with my phone.
While I enjoy a good pitcher's duel, many casual baseball fans feel like a game with little scoring is boring.
Soccer works the same way, though there are no casual soccer fans because soccer is dumb.
But if you hate a low scoring game, well, tee ball is your sport, then.
There are no outs.
Every kid bats in an inning and regardless of where they hit it they get to go to the base.
Quick math tells me, then, that however many kids you have on your team is how many runs you 'll score.
I think my son has like 10 kids on his team.
That's 30 runs a game!
It's basically a JV girl's basketball game.
I 've been lying to you for the first few hundred words.
My son doesn't actually play tee ball.
He plays coach pitch.
And in coach pitch the coach pitches you six pitches and if you can't hit it, then you get to hit off a tee.
This concept alone makes tee ball the greatest sport every invented.
If at first you don't succeed, we 'll keep making it easier for you until you do!
Think about how much cooler it would be if other sports followed suit.
Did that birdie putt on number 7 just lip out on you?
Don't worry, we 've made the hole bigger on number 8.
Those 3-pointers not falling?
Move in 15 feet and we 'll still give you the three points.
Can't score a goal in soccer?
Don't worry, we 'll make the net bigger.
Wait.
They already have a giant net in soccer?
Why the hell can't they score any damn goals then !?!
So let me get this straight: Everyone bats, no one gets out, everyone scores even though no score is kept and there are no winners and losers.
And after all of this ....
everyone goes out for ice cream.
Who doesn't love ice cream?
That's not a rhetorical question.
That's a genuine inquiry because I don't think it has an answer.
Most people reading this probably wish work was like tee ball.
Well everyone, we didn't accomplish anything at all today.
Let's get ice cream!
These days, it seems like selfies are everywhere!
You can't even go on The Facebook without seeing at least one selfie.
Pretty soon, you will be required to instagram post a selfie onto your resume to even apply for a job!
And in this job market, hoo buddy, you need every advantage you can get.
Here is a list of different selfies to try so that you can find which one best compliments your personality!
You have accidentally been locked inside a gym for weeks.
You're scared and hungry, but you 've never looked better.
Oh God no!
The camera has stolen your soul!
You love animals and you're not returning the dog.
It's yours now.
Finders keepers.
Messy and unkempt.
Does anything say self-esteem more than a makeup-less selfie?
Maybe if you put the selfie on a blimp and circled the mall a few times.
Whoa!
Look over there!
Real ones.
Look!
Imagine a political system that puts the public first.
Imagine an economy that gives everyone their fair share.
Imagine a society capable of supporting everyone's needs.
Imagine a planet protected from the threat of climate change now and for the generations to come.
Imagine there's no heaven.
It's easy if you try.
No hell below us.
Above us only sky.
Imagine all the people, living for today.
Yoo-hooooo.
That's the future we want to create and we believe we have the means to do it.
Green Party membership is soaring as more and more people are recognising that the politics of the future doesn't have to look like the politics of the past.
You may say I'm a dreamer.
But I'm not the only one.
I hope someday you will join us.
And the world will live as one.
Summary: I have no idea why the Green manifesto opener appears to be John Lennon lyrics actually verse 3 onwards recast as campaign platitudes.
It's too close for it to be a coincidence, but I doubt it's deliberate.
Probably subconscious influences bubbling over.
Liked this?
Delve into more manifesto front pages here.
No pictures.
No messing about.
This is not a bid for approval.
We start, uniquely, with a vow.
Given that political-speak usually only gets as far as ` I promise', this is badass.
For once, those gits in Westminster are actually listening.
Leverage, people.
That's what I'm talking about.
It is a vote to make Scotland's voice heard at Westminster more loudly than it has ever been heard before.
And it is a vote for more progressive politics.
Plus, once we 've got Labour where we want them, they 'll have to meet our demands or we 'll bring Parliament TO ITS KNEES.
You're awesome by the way.
Like your style.
Our friends and competitors overseas look at Britain, and they see a country that is putting its own house in order, a country on the rise.
They see a country that believes in itself.
It is fragile, and with the wrong decisions, it could easily be reversed.
So the central questions at this election are these: how do we maintain our economic recovery, upon which our ambitions for our country depend?
And how do we make sure that the recovery benefits every one of our citizens, at every stage of their lives?
This Manifesto sets out our plan to do just that.
It is a plan for a better future -- for you, for your family.
It is a plan for every stage of your life.
For your new-born baby, there will be the world's best medical care.
For your child, there will be a place at an excellent school.
As you look for your first job, we are building a healthy economy that provides a good career for you with a decent income.
As you look for that first home, we will make sure the Government is there to help.
As you raise your family, we will help you with childcare.
And as you grow older, we will ensure that you have dignity in retirement.
Think of the children.
Think of grandma.
What if you get cancer?
Then where will you be?
But all of these things depend on a strong and growing economy.
So as you consider how to vote, I hope you will ask this: which party is best placed to keep our economy strong?
Clinking noises.
Russell pushed the book and Robbie away with his toe.
It doesn't look soft.
Oh come on!
Catch the damn ball.
What do we pay them for?
Football was on the TV.
Lindsey entered from the kitchen, drying her hands and wrists.
She picked up dishtowels when she traveled.
This one was from Pittsburg.
What happened?
Mom!
Look at this gaur.
Robbie flipped back to the page with the gaur.
Doesn't it look soft?
Russell said, waving at the TV, The idiot missed the seventeen-yard pass on the fifteenth.
Right through his hands!
Mom!
Robbie tilted his head.
Swearing had always been a part of the household, but Robbie, precocious, felt a duty to rid his home environment of this habit.
Hang on.
She pointed a finger at her son to silence him.
Her finger was pink and wrinkly from dishwater.
Her eyes fixed on the TV.
Moo-ommm!
Look at this gaur.
Dad says it doesn't look soft but it does.
Look.
He tried to lift the book, but it was too heavy.
He adjusted, sat squat on his knees, and raised the book in both hands.
Shhhh.
His dad, standing now in front of the screen, chip bowl in hand, waved behind him for the room to be still.
Here's the replay.
Yeah, right through.
Christ.
What do we pay them for ?!
Lindsey tapped the book, which her son held aloft, absently with her pink and wrinkled finger.
She turned and left the room, calling out Come help me dry, Robbie who dropped the book on the floor and followed her to the kitchen where he continued to press the issue of gaurs and velvet.
Later that night, someone put the volume back on the shelf, but not in the right place.
And the phone back on the hook.
Robbie began: Mom, Dad.
Thank you.
I'm glad we are here.
What is this?
Russell looked at his wife.
Where is dinner?
Twenty minutes.
I told Robbie he could have twenty minutes.
Robbie waited for his parents to finish and continued.
OK.
So.
Thank you for both making it.
I'm glad we are all here.
Yes, sweetie.
Lindsey was encouraging but anxious.
The casserole was browning.
Lindsay turned to her son.
Sweetie, what are you talking about?
Did you mean ` teaching'?
You learned that in school?
Lindsey, what is he talking about?
I don't know.
Robbie, what are you talking about?
Touching.
It is how to stop bullying.
Oh bullying.
Lindsey nodded to her husband, They 've been having issues, some kid got beat up.
Well, -- scratched or something.
Two girls.
They got sent home.
They must have done some program or something to teach the kids about bullying.
Robbie felt his cheeks get warm and continued, Bullying is two people who don't like each other and they fight.
What that is called is violet crime.
VIOLENT crime, his mother corrected.
Violet is a color.
And this isn't really ` violent crime' sweetie ...
Violent crime, Robbie repeated.
He pushed his hands, which were already touching, tighter together.
Violent crime could include yelling, slapping, biting, pulling, pushing, kicking ... hang on, I forget the last one ...
Robbie, this is not bullying.
Bullying is --
No, Dad!
Robbie yelled.
I always forget the last one!
Robbie tightened his hands and pushed down into the floor with his feet.
He felt certain the word would emerge if he clenched his muscles and held on to the thought.
Robbie's thoughts swam and his face became red.
It was in there, he had just heard it today ...
Sweetie, it's OK.
You 'll get it.
It made no sense to me.
If someone poisoning their family unit had left of their own free will, why then should they cry?
This gives the remaining members time to heal ; to grow stronger.
I saw them not as having lost a member, but a cancer.
These people aren't just for you to lean on ; they too need someone to help them along.
We have our own issues, and I personally do not measure up to that laundry list of how I should be.
I am actively working on these issues that I have, but not everyone will do the same.
I feel that the article glosses over all the hard work we have to do to get where we are.
These attributes do not sprout and grow overnight.
They have to be planted by kind people and cultivated.
You do not have to tear someone down in order to build yourself up.
The saddest thing to me is when people do not try to provide a good, stable life for their children.
So many who were hurt, broken, or abused as children go on to do the same things to their own babies.
They either are unable or unwilling to make the connection that better is not good.
Is it good enough for their lives to be better?
What, do you only bully them half as much?
Your little boy is so polite.
She leans over the counter and lowers her voice.
Not like that other thing that just got dragged out of here.
Generations ago, the more kids you had, the better your prospects became.
Each was a fresh pair of hands, help in the fields, future caretakers during your sunset years.
Not so in the modern world.
Culture is optimized for individuals and pairs.
Leif pulls me back to reality.
I love C-B-S, he says.
He beams at his new truck, cradling it to his chest like a baby bird.
I'm glad, buddy, I say, and I mean it.
I'm glad those little metal trucks make him happy.
Glad he got to feel like a big kid shopping with his dad.
Glad he didn't poop in his pants.
Glad Donna's comments sailed right over his head.
As we walk hand-in-hand toward the minivan, Leif and I hear the muffled sound of laughter punctuated by loud, silly noises.
The two older girls are goofing off for their baby sister and her screaming fit has been forgotten.
I don't know how many people will witness our family during our worst moments.
The girls spent their souvenir money for the week in those first few hours.
The vacation picked up after that.
We hauled stuff up, down, and across.
We actually worked quite well with each other, and we were so proud of what we accomplished.
So you will have to take our word for it.
The kids were responsible for planting apple trees.
My brother told them they were going to work until they were crying and had blisters and couldn't take it anymore.
And then they were going to work some more.
After working, Dave told everyone to get showered two at a time.
Of course, the kids had their moments.
The younger two bickered like only 8-year-old best friends can.
I'm not sure, but I hope it brings us back.
Most of my work boils down to this one question, but today, it's nipping at me with particular urgency.
And that has certainly been part of our experience.
I started with my usual game plan: staff it out.
By January, I thought I had solved it.
In the space of 72 hours, the caregiver decided it wasn't a fit, and the speaking engagement cancelled.
But something else happened in that 72-hour period.
And I'd be his primary teacher and caregiver three days a week.
I grew up with a full-time working mother, so that's my normal.
The most surprising part: I 've never been happier.
Perchance do you have the McFlurry known as Creme Egg?
he asked the baffled clerk.
to the existential how will I survive this?
Charming, sure.
Possible?
Even if we don't ask for a plastic bag, we're often handed one.
If we sit down at a restaurant, we're offered a straw or two.
Across the globe, only 5 percent of the plastics we produce is recovered for reuse.
Its petroleum base makes the decay of plastic impossible.
Living a plastic-free life isn't convenient, but it's possible.
The easiest change we can make is to refuse single-use plastics like bags and straws when they are offered to us.
Want to up your commitment?
Invest in reusable products!
For every plastic bottle, bag and straw we use, an eco-friendly alternative exists.
It is not usual for an average person to know what does an IOP program refer to.
Though those who have associated with an addiction recovery program do find it common.
Also, drug and alcohol related addicts are more often a part of it.
Though in comparison to the in-patient program it turns out cheaper.
Many addiction therapy centers also accept insurance coverage plan from financial institutions.
Few of them also benefit individuals by the means of educational scholarships.
The fear of disintegrating from the family fears addicts to join an intensive rehabilitation.
Along with that the thought of staying jobless also haunts the addicts.
That is when the out-patient programs prove resourceful.
The engagement with them does not require leaving the work life to get treated.
Thus, one can achieve harmony between professional and personal life with the on-going treatment.
