President Obama is set to announce executive action tonight, granting temporary relief to some of the nearly 12 million immigrants who are living in the United States illegally. 
Here's what we know so far: 
1. 
What kind of relief is the president offering? 
Obama's move lifts the threat of deportation -- at least temporarily. 
But it does not provide the full path to citizenship as envisioned under a comprehensive immigration bill. 
2. 
Who is eligible for relief? 
Granting relief to these two groups will still leave millions of undocumented immigrants for authorities to focus their attention on. 
The administration will be issuing new guidance, reiterating that scarce deportation resources should be used for those who pose a threat or break the law, not people who have become part of the fabric of society. 
3. 
Will immigrants eligible for relief under this plan be allowed to work? 
4. 
Can they collect Social Security, Medicare or other government benefits? 
Immigrants covered under this program will receive valid Social Security numbers. 
But that will not make them eligible to claim retirement benefits. 
They are also ineligible for insurance subsidies and other benefits under the Affordable Care Act, which explicitly excludes immigrants who entered the country illegally. 
And they are not required to carry health insurance under the ACA's individual mandate. 
Immigrants granted temporary status under the Administration's earlier DACA policy are generally NOT eligible for food stamps formally known as SNAP benefits. 
Medicaid eligibility varies by state. 
Hospitals in every state already offer labor and delivery services, regardless of immigration status. 
5. 
What about driver's licenses? 
Or discounted, in-state tuition at public universities? 
Those decisions are made at the state level and are not necessarily tied to federal policy. 
For example, the National Immigration Law Center cites at least 10 states that already allow immigrants to apply for driver's licenses, regardless of their legal status. 
Conversely, two states -- Arizona and Nebraska -- continue to deny licenses to immigrants who were granted temporary legal status under DACA. 
6. 
Why is President Obama taking this action now? 
Obama says he would prefer to see Congress pass a comprehensive immigration bill, which would go further and be more permanent than this executive action. 
But the bipartisan bill that passed the Senate in 2013 has languished in the House for nearly a year and a half. 
Obama says that delay has been costly both to the economy and to those who live in fear that they or a loved one may be deported. 
7. 
Republicans have warned Obama not to take this action on his own, saying it will poison the well for future cooperation. 
What recourse do the president's congressional critics have? 
Republican lawmakers argue that the president is overstepping his authority. 
Obama himself took the same position last year, when he told immigration advocates, The problem is that I'm the president of the United States. 
I'm not the emperor of the United States. 
My job is to execute laws that are passed. 
But the White House counsel and other legal experts say Obama is acting within his power to set priorities in how immigration laws are enforced. 
As a practical matter, the courts have generally been reluctant to intervene in turf battles between Congress and the White House. 
Lawmakers could try to limit the president's action, using their power over the government's purse strings. 
But it won't be easy. 
The relief will be administered primarily through the Department of Homeland Security's Citizenship and Immigration Services agency, which is self-funded through application fees and does not rely on annual appropriations from Congress. 
A few hundred hawkers and street vendors gathered Wednesday on the side of a dusty, busy road in the northern Indian city of Gurgaon, a few miles from the capital, New Delhi. 
Some wore black headbands with No Wal-Mart signs. 
Others carried banners that said Stop uprooting hawkers and vendors. 
The crowd of protesters walked down the road to the Indian headquarters of Wal-Mart, located in one of many modern, multistoried buildings. 
They stood outside, chanting Wal-Mart, down, down! 
Wal-Mart, come to your senses! 
Wal-Mart, which opened its first Indian store in 2009, has 20 stores in nine states. 
Earlier this year, it announced plans to open 50 more. 
And the vendors and hawkers are nervous about their livelihoods. 
Our main concern with Wal-Mart and really any of the malls here is that many of them are selling fresh produce, and fish and meat, says Geetanjali Arora of the National Hawker Federation, who helped organize this protest. 
That's really affecting people who earn a daily living selling this. 
Wal-Mart functions very differently in India. 
It is not a retailer but a membership-based wholesale store called Best Price Modern Wholesale. 
It works much like Sam's Club, only the members have to be businesses themselves. 
So in theory, regular folks can't shop there. 
But an investigation by an Indian news website revealed that the stores do in fact regularly sell products to individual citizens. 
So a battle between Wal-Mart and small businesses is shaping up. 
Mom and pop stores, hawkers and vendors remain a big part of the Indian economy. 
Go to any neighborhood in an Indian city and its sidewalks and markets are lined with little shops and vendors. 
And they're worried that companies like Wal-Mart will drive them out of business. 
Wal-Mart recognizes the importance of these stores. 
Part of the company's strategy is to persuade the small businesses to buy their merchandise ... from Wal-Mart. 
So far, the company hasn't done too well in India. 
Some have argued that government regulations designed to protect smaller retailers have kept Wal-Mart from succeeding. 
And as Forbes reported last year, the retailing giant has run into a range of problems, from not having the appropriate licenses required to sell different products to not having permits in place while building stores. 
Ashok Kumar Sahni, who participated in Wednesday's demonstration, has a tea-and-snacks-cart in West Delhi. 
He's been doing this work for over a decade and is the breadwinner for a family of five. 
Sahni, 42, says he has no problems with Wal-Mart per se. 
But his business has suffered since several malls cropped up close to his shop in the past five years. 
He says he used to make between 500-700 rupees $ 8 to $ 11 a day, but these days I hardly have a customer. 
He says people now prefer to eat at malls. 
Many times we go home empty-handed, says Sudha, a 42-year-old widow who sells purses at a market in West Delhi. 
Take this past festival season for example, Diwali. 
We hardly sold anything. 
Everyone ran to malls to buy stuff. 
People going to malls have made it difficult for us! 
She's right. 
This study showed that malls and supermarkets led many vendors and hawkers in Mumbai to shut down. 
Other reports, like this 2008 study, concluded that large retailers like Wal-Mart would initially hurt vendors and hawkers, especially in the vicinity of the big stores, although it argued that the effect weakens over time. 
Right now her 23-year-old son works with her, selling purses. 
Her daughter is in high school. 
I want my son and daughter to get good training for good jobs, says Sudha. 
But we can do that only if we have some money to spare. 
If foreign companies stamp on our businesses, where will we go? 
We don't have any other demands, says Sahni. 
The government can let Wal-Mart and other companies do whatever they want, he says. 
But please don't let it affect our livelihoods. 
That's all. 
That's because one of the agencies listed was the CIA. 
Aftergood, who's a longtime critic of the CIA's aversion to public scrutiny, found that in August, the National Archives had quietly given the agency a kind of thumbs-up. 
The Archive had done a preliminary assessment of the CIA proposal, says Aftergood. 
They decided that it tentatively looked OK, and they were ready to move forward on it. 
The CIA has a different plan. 
It would preserve the email of every employee and contractor for as long as they work there, but destroy all those messages within three years of them leaving the agency. 
The only exceptions would be the CIA's top 22 officials. 
Their email accounts would become permanent documents. 
Consider Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked thousands of that agency's documents last year -- and who had earlier worked for the CIA. 
Under the CIA's proposed policy, Snowden's old emails would have been destroyed. 
The whole purpose of requiring the retention of records for a more extended period of time is an acknowledgement that the significance of records aren't always immediately apparent, says Douglas Cox, a law professor at City University of New York. 
And the case of Snowden would be a perfect example of that. 
They didn't ask permission, he says. 
They just went ahead and eliminated these records. 
They will never be retrieved, they will never be reconstructed. 
The CIA stands by its new plan for managing email. 
In a written statement, a CIA spokesperson asserted the agency would move to a standard of preservation that is greater than the National Archives requirements, well above current CIA policy. 
FIFA said Michael Garcia, an American prosecutor, and Hans-Joachim Eckert, a German judge, met today in Zurich and agreed to hand over Garcia's 430-page report to Domenico Scala, the independent chairman of FIFA's financial monitoring body. 
Scala, The Associated Press reports, would then recommend details of the confidential dossier for discussion by FIFA's executive committee. 
That committee meets in Morocco on Dec. 18 for a two-day session. 
Eckert, in a report last week, cleared Russia and Qatar of corruption in their controversial winning bids. 
Garcia criticized Eckert's report, calling it incomplete and erroneous and appealed to FIFA. 
The AP adds: Almajid alleged in 2011 that three FIFA executive committee members were paid $ 1.5 million each to vote for Qatar. 
She was named in a July 2011 statement in which she retracted her claims of corruption but says she was coerced to do so by unidentified Qatari officials. 
You can run. 
You can hide. 
Hell, you can even turn off the lights. 
Do what you want, but this thing will get you ... a complimentary t-shirt. 
Meet the KinectKannon, a semi-autonomous t-shirt cannon that can track your movements, go into night vision mode, and fire t-shirts into a crowd. 
It's like T-1000 ` s dopey little brother. 
Built by Microsoft developer evangelist Steven Edouard, the KinectKannon is largely built up out of store bought parts -- including, as you might 've guessed from the name, a Kinect. 
Add a few heavy-lift servos, some super snazzy solenoid valves, and a few thousand lines of code, and you 've got yourself a robo-cannon. 
All in all, the project cost around $ 2,500. 
Given that this project deals with high-PSI CO2 tanks which will quite happily blow your fingers/hand/face parts off if not handled correctly, this ... probably isn't the sort of DIY project most people should take on in their garage on a spare weekend. 
But if you think you're up to the task, Steven is sharing the source code here. 
The hospitals where my grandchildren are born will be unrecognizable to those we know today ; they 'll be safer, cleaner and more efficient. 
And what is considered world class in 2014 will tomorrow be viewed with the same disdain we reserve for medical practice in the Dark Ages. 
Global healthcare is at a pivotal moment in its history, on a par with Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin and Louis Pasteur's groundbreaking work with sterilization. 
As the quantity of data we generate rapidly expands and we continue to develop the computational power to store it, health authorities will be able to gather more information about their patients in a single year than has been open to them in all history. 
Thanks to advancements in data analysis, almost everything that determines our health -- from our individual genetic coding to our particular retail habits -- is becoming knowable. 
With all this information at its fingertips, the medical profession is capable of spotting patterns of disease, gauging the efficacy of treatments and identifying links between causes and symptoms. 
It has long been mooted that healthcare will be among the early big data winners. 
Intel recently announced that it is working with the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research on a new pilot initiative that is aimed at using data mined from wearable devices to detect patterns in the progression of the disease. 
The data will be collected on Intel's software platform, and analysts will examine it to look for markers of Parkinson's that couldn't be perceived by the naked eye. 
And earlier this year the University of Irvine Medical Center unveiled a radical scheme that is helping to reduce the number of deaths caused by medical error. 
My company, WANdisco, is helping the hospital use big data platform Hadoop to digitally collate, store and analyze all data relating to its patients' conditions in real time. 
Electronic signals sent out by equipment such as heart monitors, ventilators or wearable devices can now be monitored whether the patient is in the hospital, at home or on the move. 
To this end the U.S. is leading the way. 
Across America we are seeing a steady increase in the number of data-driven strategies being implemented -- progress that is transforming the standard of healthcare available to U.S. citizens. 
Many of today's startups are at the heart of the action. 
Jersey City's Medical EMS recently teamed up with Bradshaw Consulting Services to improve the hospital's ability to respond to emergency calls, where a minute can often mean the difference between life and death. 
The hospital now employs a system that collates geographic information system technology, wireless communications and GPS data to help response units arrive at their destinations more quickly, providing the emergency services with real-time analyses about where they are most likely to be needed. 
Response rates now average fewer than six minutes, significantly lower than the national average of nine minutes. 
Before the system was installed, only one in five patients regained a pulse after suffering a cardiac arrest -- today it's one in two. 
Michigan Health & Hospital Association's Keystone Center is now using ArborMetrix's technology to capture obstetrics data and reports at 60 hospitals across the state. 
The group's hospitals are using data analytics to monitor readmission rates for pneumonia and heart failure, identifying patients treated at multiple facilities to more accurately calculate readmission rates. 
This is allowing its members to better understand what they will need to do to improve the quality of care for their patients while reducing operational costs. 
Dating back to the 1940s, the NHS possesses vaults of information that, if centrally stored, could provide British doctors with an unparalleled insight into patient wellbeing. 
Having access to whole-population data, for example, would allow drug side effects to be picked up where they would previously go unreported. 
Used effectively it could revolutionize treatments and help the U.K. take a lead in the bioscience industry. 
The U.K. has the potential to personalize healthcare for every NHS patient. 
The personal data that can risk score every NHS patient already exists. 
And it is already far more centralized and normalized than in countries such as the U.S., giving the U.K. the opportunity to become the world leader. 
Identifying people at risk of becoming ill or developing a serious condition and providing the foresight to prescribe preventive measures is a very real possibility. 
Whereas the U.S. has managed to separate the revelations over spying and surveillance from discussions around big data, many in the U.K. view them as part of the same whole. 
Earlier this year, as a result of widespread public pressure, the NHS suspended its plans for Care.data, a central stash of patient records that researchers said could transform UK healthcare. 
There can be no denying that the timing was unfortunate. 
Calls for Care.data to be shelved increased rapidly as people grew twitchy about data security, while Edward Snowden's revelations about the NSA served as the ideal backdrop for civil libertarians arguing that citizens were signing away their privacy. 
Equally damaging was the way in which the NHS persisted in ignoring this climate of apprehension. 
As newspaper headlines focused on the ongoing fallout from the Snowden affair -- one that soon embroiled the U.K.'s own intelligence service -- homes up and down the country were flooded on a weekly basis with leaflets that focused on how the government was going to access confidential records. 
Only in the small print was it made apparent that patients had a right to withhold their records. 
A much more effective approach would have been to listen to the public fears and explain the life-enhancing implications of data-driven healthcare. 
How many millions could be saved by new treatments? 
How many lives currently cut short could be extended? 
And how many terminal diseases could be eradicated? 
New tech is frequently mocked or feared before, ultimately, it is grudgingly accepted. 
When Bill Clinton introduced his human genome project in the 1990s the initial investment of $ 1 billion from the U.S. government was met with public outcry. 
However, it created a $ 150 billion industry and one of the most important medical breakthroughs of our generation. 
We stand on the verge of an even greater breakthrough on a global scale. 
The more data that can be analyzed, the better the medical insights and the more lives that can be saved. 
In that context, it is everyone's interests for big data to be embraced by the worldwide healthcare community -- and not just the U.S. 
We tend to think of medical progress as something that happens in laboratories, but the reality is that future breakthroughs may have less to do with chance discovery than the systematic analyses of existing data. 
And while these are the early days of data-driven hospitals, the writing is on the wall for healthcare as we know it. 
My mom, ever the scrapbook aficionado, has documented every birthday, Halloween, dance performance, first bike ride and baby eats dirt moment me and my brothers have endured since I can remember. 
She hand-scanned every last one of those hundreds of pictures a few years back and then organized them into neat little labeled folders on her own PC. 
It took me eons to convince her to put it all in Dropbox. 
It's finally all there, but it looks like this: 
Heirloom is a new smartphone app that hopes to change that. 
You snap a picture of your old photos and the app uploads it into a private social network in the cloud that allows you to then share the pictures with your friends and family. 
Trunx is somewhat of a similar idea with the organizing and sharing of photos, but the hook with Heirloom is the scanning. 
It's also a family business. 
Brothers Eric and Evan Owski came up with the idea after Eric's wife complained that there weren't any good scrapbooking apps for moms. 
Evan, a former programmer at TuneIn, worked on the code. 
Eric is Heirloom CEO and handles the marketing end of things. 
Throwback is now a weekly ritual across the web. 
We believe that speaks to the human desire to relive treasured moments from our past, says Eric. 
Yet for many, the process of capturing old prints is clumsy and doesn't result in high quality digital images. 
When you take a picture of a photo, you have to spend a lot of time lining up the edges and cropping if you want a decent scan, explains Evan. 
Our app can take a scan even if the photo is rotated or skewed. 
It will automatically find the edges, correct the perspective, and do a bit of color correction, he tells me. 
Throwback Thursday is a social media phenom, though the brothers maintain that you may not always want to share those precious moments of your chubby former 13 year old self with the world. 
So Heirloom incorporates a more intimate network made just for loved ones. 
Amazon and Google might be chest-thumping about their respective drone delivery programs but the technology is still years out from being feasible in dense urban environments. 
Dr Mirko Kovac, director of Imperial College London ` s current aerial robotics lab, suggests it could be as far out as a decade. 
Flying close to humans, flying close to buildings, flying close to other flying vehicles, and legislation, insurance, air traffic control, all this needs to be sorted before something like this can be demonstrated, he added. 
So central London might not be the best first step ... It's difficult to put a number on it but maybe in a decade we will have commercial drone delivery in cities. 
That's maybe reasonable. 
Kovac added that drone delivery will likely arrive sooner in other types of environments -- principally where there's more room for manoeuvre and fewer obstacles for drones to worry about. 
Drone delivery in other areas such as in developing countries, such as Africa or Asia for example, there I think it's much closer because there there is vast spaces and it could be much more feasible to test and implement something there. 
That is much more close, said Kovac. 
Already you can do 3D mapping of the environment -LSB- with drones -RSB-, with something that is already on the market now -- but the next step is the interaction with an environment. 
So anything that interacts with an environment, like sampling and flight in more constrained environments, like indoors, inside of mines, for examples, making 3D map of the mine structure, or making 3D map of buildings in different ways for the construction industry. 
These areas are much more close. 
Earlier this month Imperial announced it will be building a shiny new drones research facility -- due to open in 2017. 
Costing # 1.25 million to build, the glassy structure will sit atop an existing building on its South Kensington campus so that students and others can peer up at drones being put through their paces and be inspired by the potential of the tech and the research being conducted. 
The drone lab's visibility is absolutely intentional, says Kovac. 
The flight lab will be a very good nurturing ground for actually developing the flying robots. 
We do that already but it will leverage the capabilities we have already now. 
What it will be also providing us with is a very high exposure -- so it will be a very visible VIP type facility that will be very visible and good for visitors and also to see how the research is done. 
The facility will include a glass-walled flight arena for testing drones in the air, a pool where amphibious drones can take a dip, 3D printing facilities to produce rapid prototypes, and an outdoor platform where prototype drones can take to the skies. 
There will also be 16 high speed cameras in the facility to enable 3D tracking of the drones in flight. 
Imperial is not the only university to zero in on drones. 
There are dedicated drone research facilities at several others, including MIT, Harvard and UZH in Zurich, but Kovac said the Imperial lab will offer something different. 
Specifically hybrid drone research. 
What's novel about ours is it allows us to work on hybrids -- so multimodal mobilities. 
So robots that can move in air, on ground, in water, in complex environments, in forests. 
This is something we are focusing on, he told TechCrunch. 
It's the next step for flying robots. 
Given his long view on drone delivery, it's no surprise that Imperial's lab will be focusing its research on other areas. 
Specifically the aforementioned aerial construction inspection and repair tasks, and also on environmental monitoring use-cases such as pollution tracking. 
Currently often samples are taken manually with people in the rainforest or in the sea or on ground so this can be automated, said Kovac. 
This is something we are working on -- how to do that in an automated way using swarms of flying robots. 
This should then make it much cheaper for the operators or the industry to do, and it's a very convenient and safe and quick way to do it. 
There are developments in fuel cells and different types of battery technology that have huge potential. 
The approach we take is that we optimize the aerodynamics of the platform so we use less energy for flight and like this we increase the range and flight direction, he added. 
It's an alternative approach. 
We don't work on battery technology ourself. 
It will look at ways to improve drone aerodynamics by studying biology -- so looking to flying creatures such as birds and insects for inspiration. 
We can look at how nature solves some of those challenges. 
We can look at flying animals, birds, insects, and we can extract the key design principles that they use and apply them to robots to make much better drones, added Kovac. 
Kovac said Imperial is looking for commercial partners for the lab as a way to accelerate marketplace applications of the research -- and is open for collaboration, as he put it. 
The facility is also taking in funding from research councils, and applying for grants -- with Kovac noting the U.K. government is recognizing drone tech as an important area to invest in. 
We have a lot of interest from industry. 
How we do that is we use the London Robotics Network. 
It is a network that I co-founded with an industrial partner -- which is Shadow Robotics -- and Kings College London. 
We came up with this idea to create a network where these kind of collaborations and synergies can be built and executed, he added. 
We are now really looking for ways how to bring this technology to the market together with industrial partners. 
Drones are still very much perceived as being a military technology and only now they start to move into the civil space. 
And there many big companies are now really interested in that and they're investing and exploring, prototyping, starting to adopt the technology slowly. 
But this is really just happening now. 
It's not something that is very established already. 
The potential is now really being only discovered, he added. 
Earlier this year, journalist Glenn Greenwald released a book titled No Place to Hide, chronicling the Snowden leaks, and breaking new ground on the NSA itself. 
The book garnered a grip of positive reviews upon publication, and has a 4.5 star rating on Amazon. 
Not bad, all told. 
But the most recent review of the book is by far the best. 
Hayden Peake, listed by the CIA's website as the curator of the CIA Historical Intelligence Collection, reviewed three books on Snowden for the agency. 
His take on Greenwald's tome -- read the full review here for complete fun -- is accidentally hilarious. 
Greenwald is appalled at the concept implied in the chapter's title and analyzes it with the presumption of illegality while dismissing without comment the intelligence issues that led to its adoption. 
-LSB- ... -RSB- 
Greenwald also ignores other interpretations regarding the legality of the NSA's collection programs -- for example, the views of retired admiral Michael McConnell, former director of the National Security Agency and national intelligence. 
-LSB- ... -RSB- 
Greenwald sums up the common themes of these three books: Snowden's acts were justified because he chose to seek reform of the surveillance state, 248 and journalists have the absolute right to be the final arbiters of what to publish. 
Greenwald's often bitter ad hominem rationale for this is unlikely to be the last word on the subject. 
Bitter and ad hominem final arbiter indeed. 
Actually that would make a great ad for a journalism gig. 
I'm actually quite excited to see what the last word on the subject will be. 
Perhaps Greenwald will see the error in his ways and write a positive, complimentary book that follows the government's own PR-approved narrative, ensuring that he arbitrates nary a thing. 
Earlier this month, Twitter gave the community a preview of upcoming features during its Analyst's Day event where it discussed changes to the platform and revenue streams. 
One of those touted features -- the ability to privately share aka direct message a tweet -- has now gone live. 
Says Twitter, with today's update you 'll be able to share a Tweet privately with any of your followers. 
On the desktop web and in the TweetDeck application, the option will be available by tapping the ... More icon then choosing Share via Direct Message. 
On mobile, including both the iOS and Android application, a long press on the tweet in a user's timeline will offer the option to Share via Direct Message, as well. 
On mobile, private messaging is a growing trend where a large number of apps now offer users ways to communicate outside of the public web or public social media. 
Some even go a step further, erasing messages or photos when the conversation wraps. 
Twitter has been slowly venturing into this area itself, expanding its DM private messaging feature which more recently has added support for sharing links and, as of last winter, support for photos. 
The company has for a long time been incrementally improving DMs via other minor features like the addition of a recents list and redesigned icons, too. 
The changes will be arriving today on nearly all platforms, web and mobile included, and on desktop through TweetDeck. 
TweetDeck for Mac, and apparently -- as no mention was made -- the Twitter desktop app are delayed in receiving the update, however. 
Beats is taking its Solo line wireless, with a new set of Bluetooth cans that match the wired Solo2 almost exactly in terms of external design. 
Surprisingly, they also match their wired counterpart in terms of sound, both when used with the included aux cable with inline remote, and when they're used with the Bluetooth wireless connection. 
And after Beats took its sound engineering back to the drawing board for the Beats Solo2, that means they sound surprisingly good. 
The Beats Solo2 Wireless comes as close to replicating the Solo2 signature design as possible, with just a few fractions of a millimeter different in dimensions due to the need for a battery within the case. 
The mirroring of the design of the two products was intentional, and a desired goal from the start, because Beats wanted these headphones to share all the same traits, except of the addition of wireless functionality in these new Bluetooth versions. 
The retention of the same design is smart not only to unify the Solo product line, but also because they have really top-notch fit and finish to begin with. 
The new design is a lot more visually appealing than the previous Solo, with fewer line breaks and softer angles. 
They're still plastic, and contain little in the way of metal surfaces, but the high-gloss look works well with Beats' bold colors red, yellow, white and blue are options for the Wireless model at launch. 
Solo2 Wireless packs padded cups and headband, and both are soft and comfortable for all-day use. 
They're lighter than the Studio version of Beats' headphones, and the on-ear design will probably be preferable for some. 
They fold up into a decently portable package, and will stow in the included soft case when you want to take them travelling. 
The soft case itself also contains padding, so you can throw them in a bag without much concern about their overall safety. 
Beats has gone from a brand whose headphones I'd never recommend, let alone own myself, to one that is right up there with some of the better general consumer market audio companies in terms of audio quality. 
For them to have accomplished that between a single generation of hardware is impressive. 
What's more impressive is that the Beats Solo2 wireless headphones deliver sound that is consistent regardless of whether you use them wired or wireless, and that in both cases, there's a warmth out of the box that you don't generally get from audio equipment without a decent break-in period. 
There's no active noise cancellation here, but he ear cups do offers a certain amount of passive filtering out of surrounding sound, which is plenty for most use cases. 
The audio also doesn't suffer from any kind of inherent background hiss or static, again regardless of whether you're using either wireless or wired connection. 
The Beats Solo2 Wireless is rated at 12 hours of use on a single charge, and in practice I did get a good amount of listening out of them -- definitely enough for a long day at the office, and for most flights you 'll ever have to take. 
Plus, they work with the included remote cable whenever you do run out of juice, so you won't be left in the lurch. 
For a wireless pair of headphones, 12 hours of continuous use is a very respectable duration, and Beats has also included its LED light indicator to tell you how much batter you have remaining. 
And if you're using them with an iPhone or iPad, there's also a battery indicator icon that will show up in your status bar once you 've paired them with your device. 
The Beats Solo2 Wireless Headphones are the first new hardware from Beats to arrive post-Apple acquisition, but they 've been in development long before the deal came together, and they shared a development cycle with the wired version which debuted earlier this year. 
Beats staggered their launch to make sure the wired version got its own spotlight, and to refine the additional engineering required to make sure the wireless version had identical sound, without any kind of artificial enhancement or EQ trickery. 
Overall, the company accomplished what it set out to do with the Beats2 Wireless -- these feel like they should become the new default option for customers shopping for a pair of on-ear wireless headphones. 
Price is still an issue, as it's a 50% premium over the wired version, but there's a lot more engineering involved, too. 
And thanks to that work, these don't feel overpriced, per se -- the added convenience of wireless features is hard to quantify, but if you're concerned about budget, check out Solo2 or other wired option first. 
Famed turntable brand Technics plans to launch a high-resolution music download service. 
For what it's worth, the service, unlike Neil Young's high-res service Pono, will not hit the states. 
Starting in January, the platform will spin get it? 
24-bit tracks to users in UK and Germany. 
Called Technics Tracks, it's said to be launching with tens of thousands of tracks encoded in 24-bit FLAC. 
This isn't your grandfather's iTunes. 
The high-resolution file format doesn't compress the files in the same way as a traditional music format like MP3 resulting in a better sound quality as long as the song is played through equipment that can take advantage of the larger files. 
Neil Young recently launched a similar service that also offers high-resolution audio downloads. 
Called Pono, the service complements Young's PonoPlayer, a portable FLAC player. 
The last Technics-branded turntable may have rolled off the lines in 2010, but Panasonic announced in September 2014 that it would revive the brand. 
This is clearly part of the larger picture. 
A few months ago, the guys at Seed Labs showed me an Internet of things product that piqued my interest. 
While the product isn't quite fully-baked, it was essentially a low power Bluetooth chip that could fit into any device -- a lightbulb, a kettle, a toaster -- and report, without pairing, to a cellphone. 
In other words you could simply plug in a lamp and your phone would automatically find it and add it to your IoT network. 
It was, in short, amazing. 
The team was quiet for a bit but now they're ready launch a dev kit that lets you and me connect our toasters, light bulbs, and anything else to our phones with an ease that is, in fact, startling. 
Their hardware solution is currently available in a Dev Kit that is available for pre-order. 
Why is this platform interesting? 
In the demo I saw, you could simply plug in an appliance and it would appear on your phone's control panel. 
Unlike systems like WeMo which require extensive pairing or other more techie solutions like Spark, the assumption is you 'll have Seed inside your appliances and they will begin communicating immediately. 
Because of the limited range you won't be able to connect to your neighbor's Christmas lights or TV but you will be able to connect to your kitchen, configure all of the devices, and then start the rice cooker before you come home from work. 
The project is still in its infancy but it's a very interesting platform and, because I 've seen it working, one of the most compelling IoT plays in a while. 
Will it ever make it into production? 
The team, led by Rafal Han, said they are working on appliance partnerships that could lead to some true human-lamp communication in the next few years. 
For example, David Segura, then-CEO of video ad company Giant Media, has told me that Giant's publishers expected to be paid 30 days after a campaign, while its advertisers took 60 days to pay. 
He said that without credit from FastPay, Giant would have had to raise venture funding just to have the cash to deal with those issues. 
Since I spoke to Segura two years ago, Giant Media was acquired by Adknowledge. 
The new funding comes from Oak HC/FT a growth fund from Oak Investment Partners focused on health care and financial services and brings FastPay's total equity funding to $ 19 million. 
A significant amount of FastPay's financing has come in the form of debt, which makes sense -- in fact, given the FastPay model, I asked founder and CEO Jed Simon pictured above via email if he felt conflicted about raising so much equity funding. 
We don't feel there is a conflict because we are not against raising equity, we simply feel that many young, rapidly growing businesses find themselves in a position where they are forced to raise funding too early and for the wrong reasons, he said. 
It is important that entrepreneurs know all their financing options ; in fact, we often work alongside VCs. 
In one of the greatest examples of LittleBits engineering I 've seen in a while, maker Sean Ragan made a little box that reminds you to take objects when you leave the house. 
You can place anything inside it -- glasses, a wallet, your pills, the skull of a marmot -- and it will ring a bell if you pass by it without taking the item out. 
You can pop over here to read the instructions on how to build your own DLHWI Machine or just watch Sean's fun video, above. 
Either way, I suspect we all need this box in our lives and I also suspect we 'll all throw it against the wall once it reminds us with a shrill ringing noise one too many times. 
It is an epidemic or, at least, it's a very common, Hansraj told The Washington Post. 
Just look around you -- everyone has their heads down. 
An adult's head weighs about 10 to 12 pounds. 
According to Hansraj's research, which will be published next month in Surgical Technology International, tilting the head forward just 15 degrees can increase the force on the cervical spine to 27 pounds. 
And at 60 degrees -- the common texting posture seen on sidewalks, metros and office hallways everywhere -- the stress on the spine can hit 60 pounds, thanks to the forces of gravity. 
People spend an average of two to four hours a day with their heads tilted over reading and texting on their smartphones and devices. 
Cumulatively this is 700 to 1,400 hours a year of excess stresses seen about the cervical spine, Hansraj's study reads. 
GoPro fell more than 9 percent today, after it priced its secondary offering at $ 75 per share, a discount to its market price. 
The company ended regular trading today at $ 71.74 per share, or a several dollar negative delta to the proposed price. 
The company will sell 1,287,533 itself, while prior shareholders will sell 9,072,967. 
Underwriters of the sale may purchase 1,554,075 shares as well inside of a 30 day period. 
So, dilution to GoPro investors won't be too heavy, but certainly seeing current shareholders get rid of more than 9 million shares worth -- at the proposed $ 75 price -- $ 680,472,525, doesn't inspire confidence. 
In fact, you almost wonder why the company is raising new capital for itself at all. 
GoPro ended its last quarter with $ 237.7 million in cash and equivalents. 
The proposed sale of new equity would add just under $ 100 million to its accounts. 
GoPro has had a wild ride in the public markets since its debut. 
Priced at $ 24 per share, the company has traded as high as $ 98.47. 
You can see the spikes and declines here: 
The legislation, proposed by Utah lawmaker Marc Roberts, is due to go to the floor of the Utah House of Representatives early next year, but it was debated in a Public Utilities and Technology Interim Committee meeting on Wednesday. 
The bill, H.B. 161, directs municipalities like Bluffdale to refuse support to any federal agency which collects electronic data within this state. 
The NSA brought its Bluffdale data center online about a year ago, taking advantage Utah's cheap power and a cut-rate deal for millions of gallons of local water, used to cool the 1-million-square-foot building's servers. 
Roberts' bill, however, would prohibit the NSA from negotiating new water deals when its current Bluffdale agreement runs out in 2021. 
The law seems like a long-shot to clear legislative hurdles when Utah's legislature re-convenes next year, but Wednesday's committee hearing was remarkable, nonetheless, says Nate Carlisle, a reporter with the Salt Lake Tribune who has waged a fight with the NSA and Bluffdale officials to determine how much water the data center is actually using. 
What's noteworthy is no one on the panel said: ` Hey, wait a minute, we can't do this,' he says. 
They had some specific concerns about the language of the bill, but there was no outright opposition. 
Instead, they simply listened to testimony on the NSA and Bluffdale's support of the center. 
I just don't want to subsidize what they're doing on the back of our citizens, Carlisle quotes Republican Representative Roger Barrus as saying during the meeting. 
Utah has a long history of disputes with the federal government, but this is the first time Carlisle remembers anyone proposing to cut off water to a federal agency. 
I think it's representative of an attitude change in Utah that the bill is even being discussed, he says. 
CGI is wonderful and I love it when excellent animators use it for their films but there's something about the ol' trusty pen and pencil way of hand drawing even if it's not done with a pen and pencil that always makes me smile. 
It's like doing things simpler is sometimes better. 
This hand drawn animation is a trailer for Big Hero 6 and it was made by Tekken to promote the movie in Japan. 
I haven't watched the real movie yet but I wouldn't mind watching a full movie of this hand drawn version at all.

Microsoft previously announced that Windows 10, its next operating system, will contain a single app store that will work across device classes. 
Don't make the Lord of the Rings joke. 
The company also previously promised that organizations will be able to curate their own app experience for their users. 
Today, it announced that a Web-based store will be an option for companies that want control what apps their employees, say, can install. 
Apps that are assigned to a user will be up for installation with a single click. 
This is a play towards the heart of large, enterprise customers. 
Offer IT folk new tools, and you might get their attention. 
If you buy your own computer, this won't impact you, but it could make Windows 10 more appetizing to large enterprise customers that shunned Windows 8. 
Microsoft is currently rolling out updates to its first Windows 10 preview, aimed at large clients. 
A consumer preview is expected to land in January. 
Microsoft is in a tough spot -- most large companies are moving to Windows 7, or have already landed on the operating system. 
Windows 7, about to be two generations old, only has so much life left in its support calendar. 
If the company can't get those customers onto Windows 10, it will face another Windows XP-like situation, with a large chunk of the world running an operating system that it no longer updates. 
Not so good. 
So Windows 10 matters. 
It will take more than Web-based app stores to get large clients to hop aboard, but the promise may help.

What counts as excessive? 
Less than you might think. 
Women who consume eight or more drinks per week are considered excessive drinkers. 
And for men, excess is defined as 15 or more drinks a week. 
The researchers defined a drink as just 5 ounces of wine, 12 ounces of beer or 1.5 ounces of spirits. 
So, say I have a smallish glass of wine with dinner most nights of the week. 
Then I go out on Saturday night and have a cocktail and a beer, or maybe more wine. 
Does this means I am drinking excessively? 
And, from a health perspective, the more people drink to excess, the higher their risks. 
Brewer points to a host of diseases that are linked to excessive alcohol use over time. 
This could include breast cancer, for example, liver disease, liver cancer, heart disease, to name a few. 
This means that despite drinking a lot of alcohol, they don't experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop drinking, nor do they report an increased tolerance for alcohol. 
There are several other criteria for alcohol dependence as well. 
The findings are based on survey data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. 
About 138,000 participants were asked a series of questions about their drinking patterns and alcohol dependence. 
Researchers acknowledge that some participants could have underestimated their consumption or dependency. 
But Brewer says it's important to understand that the excessive drinkers who are not alcohol dependent are unlikely to need addiction treatment. 
They may also respond to interventions such as increased alcohol taxes to drink less. 
Google's Project Loon, the company's effort to deliver Internet access from balloons that travel around the world in the stratosphere, continues to make strides toward a commercial launch. 
A few days ago we heard that Google will launch a test with Australia's largest telco provider Telstra next month and today, Google released a bit more info about the state of the project. 
Its balloons, for example, can now stay in the air up to 10 times longer than when the project started last year. 
Many now last over 100 days -- and some even up to 130 days. 
In total, the balloons have now flown over three million kilometers though this one, which apparently crashed in Africa a few days ago, probably didn't make it quite as far. 
Google also says that it has gotten much better at steering its balloons. 
By constantly computing thousands of trajectory simulations it turns out we can get pretty close to our targets, the Loon team writes on Google + today. 
For example, one flight came within 1.5 km of our target destination over a flight of 9,000 kilometers, purely through predicting and sailing with the stratospheric winds. 
Google also says it has developed new equipment to inflate its balloons. 
It now only takes about five minutes to get a balloon ready for launch and the company says it can launch up to 20 balloons a day now. 
As Google X's Astro Teller told us earlier this year, Google plans to partner with telcos on this project. 
This means Google isn't buying spectrum itself, but it will work with existing providers to give them access to its balloons and they get to use their licenses to transmit from the stratosphere. 
The project may have indeed looked a bit crazy in the early days, but Google is obviously dedicated to the project and it's clearly making progress right now. 
Flickr today is expanding its Wall Art print service to include access to images from Flickr's licensed artists and Creative Commons. 
The expansion comes only a month after the launch of Flickr Wall Art, which initially allowed users to turn any of their personal photos into canvas prints. 
Flickr also previously launched a photo book service, again for personal photos. 
The changes come at a time when Flickr has been ramping up its competition with challengers like 500px, the Andreessen Horowitz-backed photo community and marketplace which had been describing itself as the Flickr for pro photographers. 
The idea was that Flickr, having been abandoned at Yahoo for too long, had made it possible for other startups to come in and profit where Flickr had stagnated. 
In recent months, Flickr has been making moves to better compete, however. 
In addition to its photo books and personal Wall Art, it also announced an updated licensing program that allowed pro photographers to get their work featured on news sites, including Yahoo properties. 
And now it's broadly expanding its Marketplace, offering consumers the ability to buy Wall Art in sizes ranging from 8 ″ x10 ″ up to 20 ″ x30 ″. 
The company is still offering two styles, Premium Photo Mounts printed with professional grade paper and mounted with 1 ″ wood-textured edges ; and Gallery Canvas Wrap, stretched across a traditional 1.25 ″ wood frame. 
Premium Photo Mounts are now starting at $ 49, while Gallery Canvas Wraps are starting at $ 29. 
The work of Flickr's licensed artists will start at $ 59 and $ 35 respectively, a 20% premium. 
Users looking to buy professional prints will be able to choose from 50 million Creative Commons licensed photos, or a hand-picked selection of premium prints from Flickr pro photographers. 
A GIFT14 coupon code is offering a 40% discount up until Dec. 23rd. 
According to Rajiv Vaidyanathan, Director, Product Management at Flickr, those whose works are for sale through the new service are being invited in by Flickr. 
It's not broadly available to just anyone looking to sell. 
He says the company is searching for images that match what the market is looking for, and is launching today with eight main categories of prints for things like landscapes, animals, abstract, and more. 
There are no subcategories or ways to narrow down selections at this time, but that could be something Flickr has in the works. 
The company has been developing image recognition technology that could play a role here, as well as in surfacing photos across its site. 
Today you 'll see the image recognition technology improving the search experience in the Creative Commons category. 
And as Flickr integrates those search capabilities into the Flickr Marketplace, the search enhancements will improve categorization and discoverability moving forward, a company rep tells us. 
Some Flickr users have been uncomfortable with the way auto-tagging has been implemented, saying that it had been turned out without users' knowledge or consent, and was not offering an opt-out. 
Of course, users' photos set to private would not be surfaced in searches just because they were automatically tagged. 
Early this year, Dropbox threw a glitzy launch event for its new photo storage and viewing app Carousel, and people went right on using the dozen other ways to keep and comb through memories. 
Despite Dropbox's 300 million users, it saw less than a half million downloads on Android, and has hovered around # 350 on the iOS photo app chart, falling out of the top 1500 apps overall less than two weeks after launch. 
But Dropbox needs photos. 
They're one of the most common file types people store in its cloud, and have the emotional value that people will pay to keep safe. 
Dropbox can ill afford Carousel's failure. 
So today it hopes a repolished and newly multi-platform Carousel front-end will help it fight iCloud, Google + / Drive, Flickr, 500 Pixels, and the rest for photo storage on the backend. 
Carousel is all about combining photos on your device with all the ones you store up in Dropbox. 
The auto-saved cloud photos are supposed to load just as quick as the local ones, and they can all be rapidly browsed through using a carousel style wheel that lets you whip back to a specific point in time. 
A messaging feature lets you instantly send big sets of photos or videos to friends that would have taken ages to email or SMS. 
Now the dusty iOS and Android Carousel apps are getting a cleaner interface that highlights photos with faces over your boring, endless shots of food and sunsets you 'll probably never look at again. 
The app launches on iPad today and Android tablets soon to let you look at photos on a bigger screen. 
And most importantly, Carousel is now viewable from the web. 
I say viewable because you can't actually upload photos to Carousel from your computer, which seems like a fatal flaw. 
It also lacks the scroll wheel interface that made Carousel fun to whip around on mobile, leaving the web version feeling half-baked. 
None of the interfaces allow any sort of photo editing, which puts it far behind the flexibility of some competitors. 
Carousel will need a more compelling product to be a serious deciding factor in where people store their photos. 
Dropbox is willing to wait until Carousel is more complete to see it pay dividends. 
Product Manager on Carousel Chris Lee refused to own up to the soggy download rates on Carousel, instead telling me We think of this very much as a long-term bet. 
People have photos and videos scattered across their devices. 
There still isn't one solution. 
Without web uploads, Carousel isn't that solution either, but hopefully it will get there with a few more iterations. 
Unfortunately, nothing's been done to solve one of the original criticism of Carousel: the price. 
Dropbox users start with a free 2GB of storage, and they get 3 more if they sign up for Carousel. 
But most people who would care about a photo storage app have way more than 5GB of memories, which means they 'll likely need to cough up $ 10 a month for a terabyte of space. 
Lee admits that there are lots of people with more than 5GB of media to store, and that Carousel is a big up sell for Dropbox storage space. 
The initial free space is a great way to experience the product. 
Our job is to make it so convenient for people that Carousel and Dropbox are worth paying for Lees says. 
But with no middle-tier between 5GB and 1000GB, Carousel can seem expensive. 
On iCloud, $ 1 a month gets you 20GB and $ 4 gets you 200GB. 
$ 2 a month gets you 100GB on Google Drive. 
A terrabyte comes free with ads on Flickr. 
A $ 99 annual Amazon Prime subscription gives you unlimited photo storage plus a whole lot else. 
Lee grits his teeth into smile and spins the issue, saying There's a really high bar. 
We have to build products people are willing to pay for. 
At the end of the day, I think that motivates us to build even better products. 
Apple makes money on hardware, Google and Yahoo on ads, and Amazon on ecommerce. 
Storage is becoming commoditized because they can give it away as a loss leader. 
That means Dropbox will have to win with convenience, which it does well with, and added-value. 
To deliver the latter, its product will have to move faster. 
Taking seven months to launch an incomplete web version with no editing won't cut it. 
Carousel needs more before it's ready to ride. 
Kaufmann Mercantile is an online retailer that focuses on the curation of luxury, high-quality products. 
You could think of it a bit like Fab.com, but with a focus on luxury products as opposed to funky design. 
Kaufmann Mercantile sells everything from accessories to beauty products to home furnishings to workman's tools, however the company isn't ultra-focused on the super crowded clothing space. 
So what will you find on Kaufmann Mercantile? 
You could browse this $ 200 shaving kit, or this $ 500 hatchet, or even this very special $ 250 thermal carafe. 
The possibilities are endless. 
Kaufmann Mercantile has been around since 2009 and has sold over $ 6 million worth of merchandise, coming out to around 180,000 products sold. 
According to the company, they 've worked to get over 300 of the world's best manufacturers from more than 20 countries across the globe. 
In a prime-time speech to the country, Obama said he will offer temporary protection from deportation to the parents of children who are either U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents and he will also expand protection to more DREAMERers, or children who entered the country illegally with their parents. 
Those two groups will also be allowed to legally work in the United States, after passing a background check and paying a fee. 
To those Members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill, Obama said. 
I want to work with both parties to pass a more permanent legislative solution. 
And the day I sign that bill into law, the actions I take will no longer be necessary. 
Even before Obama delivered his speech, congressional Republicans warned that this action would kill any chance of comprehensive immigration legislation. 
Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn took it a step further, warning of a political and social firestorm. 
The country's going to go nuts, because they're going to see it as a move outside the authority of the president, and it's going to be a very serious situation, Coburn said in an interview with USA Today. 
You're going to see -- hopefully not -- but you could see instances of anarchy. 
... You could see violence.

No Path To Citizenship: 
This deal does not apply to anyone who has come to this country recently, Obama says. 
It does not apply to anyone who might come to America illegally in the future. 
It does not grant citizenship, or the right to stay here permanently, or offer the same benefits that citizens receive -- only Congress can do that. 
All we're saying is we're not going to deport you. 
That's why we're going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security, Obama said. 
Felons, not families. 
Criminals, not children. 
Gang members, not a mother who's working hard to provide for her kids. 
We 'll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day. 
Update at 8:02 p.m. ET. 
Immigration System Is Broken: 
It's been this way for decades, Obama said. 
And for decades, we haven't done much about it. 
Update at 7:31 p.m. ET. 
The Fine Print: 
We 've outlined in broad terms what is included in Obama's executive action. 
If you're curious, here's the fine print, according to the White House: 
-- Obama will expand his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to include any children who were brought to this country illegally before January 1, 2010. 
Before, the president had deferred the deportation of those born after 1981 who had entered the country before June 15, 2007. 
-- Neither of those two groups will be given a green card. 
Both of them will be able to get a Social Security card, but they will not be eligible for Social Security benefits. 
-- On the enforcement front: The administration will now concentrate on deporting criminals and those who pose a threat to national security. 
This means an unknown number of immigrants may continue to live in the United States illegally but without the threat of deportation. 
If we start broadening that, Obama said referring to an earlier executive action that deferred the deportation of young immigrants, then essentially I 'll be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. 
So that's not an option. 
The White House has released two excerpts of President Obama's prime-time speech. 
In the first, he says that this approach is not amnesty. 
Instead, the president will say, leaving the system the way it is amounts to amnesty. 
Mass amnesty would be unfair, Obama will say. 
Mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character. 
What I'm describing is accountability -- a commonsense, middle ground approach: If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. 
If you're a criminal, you 'll be deported. 
If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up. 
Update at 6:17 p.m. ET. 
The Legal Authority: 
First, the senior administration official said, the executive branch is given prosecutorial discretion by the constitution. 
That means the Department of Homeland Security can set enforcement priorities and can decide whom to deport.

Obesity used to be an issue primarily in well-off countries. 
It was one of those things flippantly dismissed as a first-world problem. 
Now people are packing on the pounds all over the planet. 
In some fast-growing cities in China, for example, half the people are now overweight. 
Over the last decade, no country in the world managed to trim its obesity prevalence. 
Some of the worst rates of obesity are now in the developing world. 
Indeed, the number of people categorized as excessively heavy is growing faster than the buffet line at a Vegas casino. 
The report predicts that if current trends continue, 41 percent of adults in the world will be overweight by the year 2030. 
The report also finds that burgeoning waistlines have a ripple effect. 
This is a massive global economic issue, says Dobbs. 
It's largely been left to the health people but actually it's having a huge economic effect and there really hasn't been a systematic view of how to address it. 
The McKinsey report estimates the economic impact of obesity around the world at $ 2 trillion a year. 
Part of that figure is the cost of caring for diseases that are linked to obesity, like Type 2 diabetes. 
But there's an even bigger cost in the loss of productivity, Dobbs says. 
People suffering from obesity often work less. 
They have to take more time off sick. 
They retire early or even die early. 
The United States has the highest obesity rate in the world: 34.9 percent. 
And while Americans are known for enjoying fast food and being big, the other countries in the top five fattest nations might surprise you: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico and South Africa. 
The challenge we have with addressing obesity is we are fighting thousands of years of evolution, he says. 
Our bodies have a natural inclination to want to horde energy when we have it available. 
-LSB- We want -RSB- to horde food and to horde fat. 
Programs to get individuals to eat right and exercise more must be a part of any weight loss effort. 
But the report makes it clear that focusing just on the eating habits of the morbidly obese -- in other words, blaming the victim -- won't solve anything. 
Personally I know if there's cheese in the fridge, I eat it, Dobbs says. 
If I open the fridge and there's not cheese there, I eat the celery. 
The city of Montgomery agreed to new polices to avoid jailing people who say they are too poor to pay traffic tickets. 
In that Alabama city, as in Ferguson, there's been tension between poor residents and police over the way people are fined for traffic tickets and other minor violations and then sometimes jailed for not paying. 
In the settlement, the city agreed to set a clear standard for municipal courts to determine whether someone is too poor to pay court fines and fees. 
There have been similar lawsuits elsewhere -- a judge closed down the municipal courts of two small Alabama towns in 2012 and 2013 -- but those cases are still being hashed out and Montgomery is the first city to complete court reform following a lawsuit. 
In Montgomery, people with income at 125 percent of the federal poverty level, which amounts to less than $ 24,000 for a family of four, now will be considered indigent. 
They will be allowed to pay off tickets by performing community service or by paying fines at $ 25 a month. 
The settlement also requires the city of Montgomery to stop using a private probation company that charged offenders extra fees to collect fines. 
And the courts have agreed to hold amnesty days, when people can get arrest warrants lifted. 
A similar program of warrant forgiveness is being tested in Ferguson. 
Sharnalle Mitchell was arrested Jan. 26 at her home in Montgomery for failure to pay traffic tickets from 2010. 
The single mother was handcuffed in front of her children, 1 and 4 years old, and sentenced to 58 days in jail to pay off unpaid fines. 
Mitchell, who also cared for her disabled mother, said she made a couple of small payments but fell behind because she had little income, less than $ 14,000 a year that she made from her occasional work styling hair. 
In the crowded, dirty jail, she says, she was despondent. 
I felt like I was going to lose my kids, she says. 
I felt everything was just going down the drain. 
She got out of jail early after an attorney from a small civil rights nonprofit found her in her cell. 
She handed me the court documents that said either she had to sit in jail for 59 days or pay $ 2,800, money she didn't have, says Alec Karakatsanis of Equal Justice Under Law. 
She could pay off her debt at $ 50 a day, plus make an extra $ 25 on days she agreed to work as a janitor and clean the dirty jail cells. 
On the back of her court documents, she had listed the days from 1 to 58, with the amount of money she made each day, subtracted from $ 2,800. 
Karakatsanis, who sued on behalf of 16 people, says the city violated constitutional protections that prevent people from going to jail simply because they are too poor to pay court fines. 
Debtors' prisons were outlawed in the U.S. before the Civil War. 
But the NPR investigation found there are no clear standards for how to determine who is too poor to pay -- and should be excused -- and those who have the ability to pay but simply refuse. 
As a result, the NPR series found, every day, poor Americans sit in jail because they can't pay off their court costs. 
Robert Segall, an attorney representing Montgomery, denies the city acted improperly and says municipal court judges had made a considerable effort to determine whether there was an ability to pay and put off imposing any kind of penalties for quite a long period of time to give offenders multiple chances to pay what they owed. 
But in May, a federal judge, responding to the lawsuit, cited concerns and issued an injunction, stopping the city from collecting fines. 
Segall said the city negotiated with lawyers from Equal Justice Under Law and the Southern Poverty Law Center to avoid a lengthy court fight. 
He says the city welcomed the chance to institute clearer procedures. 
There's been similar scrutiny of municipal courts in Ferguson, where arrests are a continuing source of tension. 
Last year, the municipal court in Ferguson, a city of 21,135 residents, issued 32,975 arrest warrants for nonviolent offenses, mostly driving violations. 
The City Council has already proposed steps to reduce the arrest warrants. 
A ticket amnesty -- extended through the end of the year -- allows people to erase pending arrest warrants and reset what is owed in small payment plans. 
The city of St. Louis announced a similar step last month, saying it would forgive some 220,000 warrants for nonviolent traffic offenses. 
Other municipalities in St. Louis County are considering similar programs. 
Karakatsanis says the agreement in Montgomery could show a way to do court reform in Ferguson. 
The settlement this week, he says, has a chance to be a really groundbreaking moment in the fight against the rise of modern debtors' prisons. 
Advocates of assisted-suicide laws believe that mentally competent people who are suffering and have no chance of long-term survival, should have the right to die if and when they choose. 
If people are have the right to refuse life-saving treatments, they argue, they should also have the freedom to choose to end their own lives. 
Opponents say that such laws devalue human life. 
Medical prognoses are often inaccurate, they note -- meaning people who have been told they will soon die sometimes live for many months or even years longer. 
They also argue that seriously ill people often suffer from undiagnosed depression or other mental illnesses that can impair their ability to make an informed decision. 
Before the debate, the audience at the Kaufman Music Center in New York was 65 percent in favor of the motion and 10 percent against, with 25 percent undecided. 
After the debate, 67 percent favored the motion, with 22 percent against, making the team arguing against the motion the winner of this debate.

The Associated Press says: Those consumers have separate dental coverage in addition to a medical plan, and were double-counted by mistake, said -LSB- White House spokesman Aaron -RSB- Albright. 
They had purchased both the medical and dental plans through HealthCare.gov and state insurance markets created under the law. 
Right now, at preschool programs around the country, teachers are tapping infinite reserves of patience to keep the peace among children at various stages of development and need. 
They're also providing meals, wiping noses and delivering a curriculum in math and reading that will get the kids ready for school. 
And there are hugs. 
Lots of hugs. 
A working parent like me would say these services are priceless. 
But according to a brand-new study from the University of California, Berkeley, the economy values them between $ 8.63 and $ 20.99 per hour. 
That wide range depends largely on location and classification. 
Childcare workers, who are more likely to work with younger children and in homes, have seen their real wages drop by a penny an hour compared to 1989, when this study was first conducted -- from an average of $ 8.63 in West Virginia to $ 12.47 in Massachusetts. 
Preschool workers, who are more likely to work with older children in licensed centers and in publicly funded, school-based programs, earn more -- from $ 11.57 an hour in Delaware to $ 20.99 in NYC. 
Not only is the pay low, the divisions within the profession are somewhat arbitrary, says Deborah Phillips, a professor at Georgetown University and a co-author of both the original study and this update. 
The demands of caring for children who are just learning to speak and gain independence are, if anything, greater than for 3-year-olds. 
And kindergarten teachers earn far more than either category, even though there's mounting evidence that the social, emotional, and cognitive benefits of high-quality programs for the very young can last a lifetime. 
There's a disconnect between our 21st century knowledge about early childhood teaching and these 20th century wages, says Phillips. 
We desperately need educated young people to be working with young children, but they look at this job and say, ` It's a pathway to poverty. 
I can't pay my student loans if I do this.' 
Wages come out as the strongest predictor of observed quality of care, says Phillips. 
The caliber of teachers is tied to their wages. 
Any rise in wages is unlikely to come from private pockets. 
Even middle-class families often find childcare unaffordable as it is, to the point where it's cited as a cause for a notable rise over the past decade in mothers staying at home. 
Policymakers and the business community are all now turning to early childhood education as one of the best investments we can make, says Phillips. 
But if you don't pay adequate wages, you undermine the very thing that produces that value. 
When the loss of productivity due to illness and disability is added in, the bill comes to $ 322 billion, or $ 1,000 a year for each American, including those without diabetes. 
That's 48 percent higher than the same benchmark in 2007 ; not a healthy trend. 
For a person diagnosed with diabetes, the average economic burden was $ 10,970 a year. 
Caring for a pregnant woman with gestational diabetes cost $ 5,800 a year. 
Undiagnosed diabetes costs $ 4,030 a case, and prediabetes, or having abnormal blood sugar that doesn't met the diagnostic criteria for diabetes, $ 510. 
Those last two reflect the fact that people with undiagnosed diabetes or elevated glucose tend to go to the doctor more often. 
About 29 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ; 8 million of them haven't yet been diagnosed. 
Another 86 million, or 37 percent of adults, have prediabetes, which is more common as people age. 
And though the symptoms of gestational diabetes usually recede when a woman gives birth, both she and her child are at higher risk for Type 2 diabetes. 
The researchers, at the IHS Life Sciences economic consulting group, combed data from multiple sources, including hospital discharges, private insurers and Medicare to come up with the trend lines. 
The various data sources vary, so it's hardly the last word. 
But it provides a solid look at the trend. 
The economists crunched the numbers for individual states, too. 
West Virginia had the highest rate of people diagnosed with diabetes, at 10 percent. 
Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi all posted rates over 8 percent. 
And these were people with health insurance. 
It's hard to imagine that the numbers could be worse, but they almost certainly would be for people who are uninsured. 
On Sept. 9, BJ Holloway's life savings were stolen. 
Six cows worth about $ 10,000 were taken in the dead of the night from his land in Spencer, Okla.. 
BJ started raising cows when he was just a teenager. 
His parents gave him the first two, and he raised those until they had calves he could sell off to buy some more. 
Over the years, he kept doing that, breeding the cows and selling off the little ones. 
Raising cows is a business for BJ, and all of his savings are wrapped up in them, which made the theft of the cows absolutely devastating. 
It really hit me that night when everything is quiet in the house ... knowing your investment is gone, said Holloway. 
If you ever had anything taken away from you that you worked all your life to try to create -- all the sudden, it's gone. 
BJ had no idea who took his cattle. 
And here in Oklahoma, when cows are stolen, lots of times, you never find the thief. 
The cows all look alike, and BJ hadn't branded of all his cattle, meaning there wasn't any way to tell who they belonged to. 
Jerry Flowers' official job title is chief special agent in charge of the law enforcement section for the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture. 
Jerry is a cowboy through and though. 
He and his team have an unofficial uniform of starched jeans, starched shirts, wore-out boots, and a clean, white hat. 
Jerry got turned on to BJ's case by the owner of the local cattle auction house, OKC West. 
The owner of OKC West, Bill Barnhart, called Jerry after getting an anonymous tip, a phone call, from someone saying that a man named C. Wright was stealing cattle. 
When Jerry looked up C. Wright in the auction house records, he found that the same day BJ's six cows were stolen, C. Wright came into the auction house with six cows to sell. 
And the cows that C. Wright sold were the same kind of cows that were stolen from BJ. 
Jerry watched surveillance video of C. Wright making the drop. 
And the video shows just how easy it is to sell stolen cattle. 
In the video, C. Wright gets out of the truck, says a few words to the auction house employee, and the three cows run out of the trailer into the pens to be sold. 
That's it. 
No one checks any paperwork, and C. Wright doesn't have to prove he owns the cows. 
This is the way they do business here in Oklahoma. 
It's a handshake. 
It's based on trust. 
After Jerry watched the video, he sat in the parking lot of the auction house waiting for C. Wright to show up. 
Jerry knew he would be back to pick up the money for the three cows he thought the auction house had sold for him. 
Jerry watched and waited until C. Wright's truck pulled in. 
When it did, Jerry approached the truck and got C. Wright and his friend to confess to stealing the three cows in under 20 minutes. 
They also confessed to taking BJ's six cows. 
Later C. Wright and his friend told me stealing cows is easy. 
They said all you have to do is walk into the pasture with some food in a bucket. 
You shake the bucket at the cows, and they come over. 
Once you 've got them in the pen -- you back up your livestock trailer and chase the cows inside. 
Once they in, I shut my gate, put everything back like it was, and I'm gone, C. Wright told me. 
He said stealing three cows took about 30 minutes, and it seemed like a perfect crime. 
Out here on these ranches there are very few houses, very few people to catch thieves in the act. 
C. Wright and his friend made a calculation. 
The amount of money you can get for the stolen cows is high. 
The chance of getting caught is low. 
Which makes you wonder why the ranchers out here don't do more to protect their cattle. 
They could beef up security by putting in cameras. 
They could put RFID tags in the cows so they could always know where they are. 
They could brand all their cattle so auction houses know who they belong to. 
But the ranchers out here are doing their own calculation. 
Sure, they could spend the money on RFID chips and security, but for them, cow thefts are still rare enough that it doesn't make economic sense to do that. 
Jerry says C. Wright and his friend will be charged next week. 
They face jail time. 
As for BJ, he's unlikely to get his cows back. 
He could get some money back from the auction house's insurance, but he's still waiting to hear if that will actually happen. 
To honor the 25th anniversary of the Wall's demise and the artist's 70th birthday this year, Sanborn has decided to reveal a new clue to help solve his iconic and enigmatic artwork. 
It's only the second hint he's released since the sculpture was unveiled in 1990 and may finally help unlock the fourth and final section of the encrypted sculpture, which frustrated sleuths have been struggling to crack for more than two decades. 
The 12-foot-high, verdigrised copper, granite and wood sculpture on the grounds of the CIA complex in Langley, Virginia, contains four encrypted messages carved out of the metal, three of which were solved years ago. 
The fourth is composed of just 97 letters, but its brevity belies its strength. 
Even the NSA, whose master crackers were the first to decipher other parts of the work, gave up on cracking it long ago. 
So five years ago, concerned that he might not live to see the mystery of Kryptos resolved, Sanborn released a clue to help things along, revealing that six of the last 97 letters when decrypted spell the word Berlin -- a revelation that many took to be a reference to the Berlin Wall. 
To that clue today, he's adding the next word in the sequence -- clock -- that may or may not throw a wrench in this theory. 
Now the Kryptos sleuths just have to unscramble the remaining 86 characters to find out. 
Sanborn told WIRED that he's always been fascinated by Berlin's many clocks but the Berlin Clock in particular has intrigued him the most. 
The clock, also known as the Berlin Uhr or Set Theory Clock, was designed in the 1970s by inventor and tinkerer Dieter Binninger. 
It displays the time through illuminated colored blocks rather than numbers and requires the viewer to calculate the time based on a complex scheme. 
A yellow lamp at the top of the clock blinks every two seconds while a row of red lamps beneath it represent five hours. 
Red lights on a second row denote one hour each, and time is calculated based on the number of lights illuminated. 
So if in the first line 2 lamps are lit and in the second line 3 lamps, it's 5 +5 +3 = 13h or 1 p.m., notes one description of the timepiece. 
Most people have no idea who Dieter is and all of the other people who make strange clocks in Berlin, Sanborn says. 
There's a very interesting back story to -LSB- the Berlin Clock -RSB-. 
Clock could easily refer instead to a method devised by a Polish mathematician and cryptologist during World War II to crack Germany's Enigma ciphers -- a method that was expanded on by Alan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park who are credited with ultimately cracking Enigma. 
It may be no coincidence that Sanborn has decided to release hi new clue at the same time The Imitation Game, a film about Turning's work on Enigma, is opening in US theaters on Nov. 28. 
The artwork features a large block of petrified wood standing upright, with a tall copper plate scrolling out from the wood like a sheet of paper. 
At the sculpture's base is a round pool with a fountain pump that sends water moving in a circular direction around the pool. 
Carved out of the copper plate are approximately 1,800 letters, some of them forming a cryptographic table based on a method developed by a 16th-century Frenchman named Blaise de Vigenere. 
In 1995 a small group of cryptanalysts inside the NSA quietly deciphered the first three sections of the sculpture, though no one outside the agency and the CIA's top brass knew about it. 
In 1998, CIA analyst David Stein cracked the same three messages using paper and pencil and about 400 lunch-time hours. 
Only his CIA colleagues knew of his success, however, because the agency didn't publicize it. 
A year later, California computer scientist Jim Gillogly gained public notoriety when he cracked the same three messages using a Pentium II. 
It was totally invisible. 
How's that possible? 
They used the earth's magnetic field. 
x The information was gathered and transmitted undergruund to an unknown location. 
x Does Langley know about this? 
They should: it's buried out there somewhere. 
x Who knows the exact location? 
Only WW. 
This was his last message. 
x Thirty eight degrees fifty seven minutes six point five seconds north, seventy seven degrees eight minutes forty four seconds west. 
Layer two. 
Slowly, desparatly slowly, the remains of passage debris that encumbered the lower part of the doorway was removed. 
With trembling hands I made a tiny breach in the upper left-hand corner. 
And then, widening the hole a little, I inserted the candle and peered in. 
The hot air escaping from the chamber caused the flame to flicker, but presently details of the room within emerged from the mist. 
x Can you see anything? 
q 
Sanborn has said that the first three sections contain clues to solving the final 97 letters but no one has figured out what those might be. 
After no progress cracking the last section, Sanborn released the Berlin clue five years ago, considering it a significant clue. 
I'm throwing it out there. 
It just makes that many fewer characters people have to figure out, he told WIRED at the time. 
Code detectives worked to crack the puzzle following the Berlin revelation. 
Members of a popular Kryptos Yahoo Group led by Elonka Dunin, the foremost expert on Kryptos, tried for months to resolve it but to no avail. 
Who knows if the new clue will prove to be any more helpful. 
And even if it is and sleuths decipher the final code, there's an additional message they will still need to resolve. 
Once decrypted, the fourth section reveals a riddle, which Sanborn has said requires sleuths to be on the CIA grounds to solve. 
In part of the code that's been deciphered, I refer to an act that took place when I was at the agency and a location that's on the ground of the agency, Sanborn said during a 2005 interview with WIRED. 
So in order to find that place, you have to decipher the piece and then go to the agency and find that place. 
Dunin has suggested that the coordinates may refer to the location of a Berlin Wall monument on the CIA grounds. 
Three slabs from the Berlin Wall sit at CIA headquarters, a gift from the German government. 
However, the slabs weren't dedicated as a monument until 1992, two years after Kryptos was unveiled. 
Although the coordinates of the monument's location -- 38 57 2.5 N, 77 8 40 W -- differ from the coordinates mentioned in Kryptos by four seconds in both the latitude and longitude, Dunin has speculated that the CIA may have originally planned to position the monument at the coordinates Sanborn mentions on Kryptos then later chose a different location. 
Alternatively, Sanborn may have been using an incorrect U.S. geological map when he created his sculpture and thus got the coordinates wrong, she notes. 
After all, Sanborn has other errors in his sculpture, both intentional and unintentional. 
Kryptos includes intentional spelling errors and misaligned characters set higher on a line of text than characters around them. 
But in 2006, Sanborn realized he had also made an inadvertent error, a missing x that he mistakenly deleted from the end of a line in section two, a section that was already solved. 
He discovered the omission while doing a letter-by-letter comparison of the plaintext and coded text in preparation for a book about his work. 
The x was supposed to signify a period or section-break at the end of a phrase. 
Sanborn removed it for aesthetic reasons, thinking it wouldn't affect the way the puzzle was deciphered, but in fact it did. 
What sleuths had until then deciphered to say ID by rows was actually supposed to say layer two. 
The correction hasn't helped anyone solve the rest of the puzzle, however, in the subsequent years. 
Now this second clue, Sanborn hopes, will reinvigorate efforts to solve the puzzle, though he has mixed views on whether he wants the mystery to end. 
The artist has said he'd like to see it solved in his lifetime, but also enjoys that some of the smartest minds in cryptography -- including those at the CIA and NSA -- continue to be baffled by his work. 
Only two other people, aside from Sanborn, were initially said to know the solution to Kryptos: one was the retired chairman of the CIA's Cryptographic Center Ed Scheidt, who helped Sanborn choose and alter the coding techniques for the sculpture. 
The other was William Webster, the CIA director who received a sealed envelope containing the solution at the sculpture's dedication. 
However, in 2005 Sanborn revealed to WIRED that Scheidt and Webster only thought they knew the solution. 
In fact, he had deceived them. 
In November 1989, after the East German government announced that its citizens were free from then on to cross over the Wall into West Berlin and West Germany, crowds of euphoric Germans began chipping away at the cement barrier. 
With this new clue provided by Sanford, let the chipping away on Kryptos begin. 
I won't be able to post many or any posts on Beyond Apollo in the next few weeks because of holiday and work travel. 
I 'll be hauling along research material when I travel I always do, but I doubt that I 'll have time to do much more than take notes. 
The good news is that I 'll be visiting Washington, DC, for the first time in several years, and I 've built a personal day into my meeting schedule to do some archival research. 
I hope to be able to photocopy or scan some new documents to write about in the Smithsonian archives at the Udvar-Hazy facility, which I have not visited before. 
My meetings are at the Smithsonian on the National Mall, and I look forward to breaking away, if possible, to have a look at the National Air and Space Museum. 
I last visited in 2000, so I expect that it has changed a great deal since then. 
As always, I thank you for reading Beyond Apollo. 
I appreciate your comments and suggestions. 
To conclude this post, I want to let any night-sky fans out there know about a disturbing development in Flagstaff, Arizona. 
Flagstaff was designated world's first International Dark-Sky City in 2001. 
Located 7000 feet above sea level in ponderosa pine forests on the flank of an extinct volcano, the city of 60,000 people is home to Lowell Observatory, the U.S. Naval Observatory, the U.S. Geological Survey's Astrogeology Science Center, Northern Arizona University's recently upgraded observatory, and other educational and science institutions. 
Most of these facilities have a global reach -- actually, an interplanetary reach, because scientists based at many of them are involved in missions to Pluto, Saturn, Ceres, and other places. 
Over the years, dark-sky advocates -- only a few of whom work for the observatories, it turns out -- have fought off challenges to Flagstaff's dark-skies zoning policies. 
Occasionally the city government has been seduced by the light side ; usually, as is now the case, when big-money development is promised. 
Often this happens when members of the city council fail to understand the contribution the science institutions in Flagstaff make to the community. 
They pump millions of dollars into this small city on an on-going, regular basis, and have at least since the U.S. Naval Observatory came to town in the 1950s Lowell Observatory has contributed to Flagstaff since Percival Lowell set up his first telescope on Mars Hill in 1894. 
Some of this money comes from tourism -- people visit from all over the world -- but even more comes from science. 
In addition, Flagstaff's science institutions support local science and technology education. 
One example is Flagstaff's annual two-week Festival of Science, which takes place every September, but support for schools, teachers, and students continues throughout the year. 
I wrote about Flagstaff's long and successful battle to keep its skies dark. 
You can find my article here, on the website of the Flagstaff Dark-Skies Coalition. 
The latest challenge to Flagstaff's dark skies is well described here. 
It is an apartment complex on the road leading to the U.S. Naval Observatory. 
A vote will be held December 2, but it's doubtful that the battle will end there if this ill-conceived plan goes ahead. 
A defeat for dark skies in Flagstaff would send a negative message to other towns and cities near observatories all around the world. 
If you wish to tell the Flagstaff city government that the world is watching what it does next, you can do so by sending email to the addresses below: 
The web is funded by ads. 
But so many people hate seeing them, and they often resent all the data tracking that props them up. 
It's a clash that has become a major pain point for news websites and other publishers. 
The rise of ad blockers, which let people surf the web without these annoying ads, is also blocking their revenue. 
Launched on Thursday, the service is called Google Contributor, and it asks you to pay $ 1, $ 2, or $ 3 a month to back the websites you particularly like. 
In exchange for your support, you 'll see thank you messages where ads used to be -- at least on the websites that participate in the program. 
At the moment, Google is testing the idea with ten online publishers, including The Onion, ScienceDaily, Urban Dictionary, and Mashable. 
The thank-you notes are served up through Google's existing advertising channels, and Google still takes a cut of each contribution. 
According to Google, the $ 1 to $ 3 users pay essentially covers the cost of that ad space. 
But all of this is subject to change, she says, as the platform develops. 
At this point, what we 've rolled out is very much an experiment, a Google spokesperson tells us. 
We're getting the publishers on board today. 
We 'll see not just how it works but also the public interest level. 
This type of thinking makes sense. 
If people are going to gripe constantly about ads and having their personal data sold to advertisers, why not ask them to put a nominal amount of money where their mouths are? 
Google Contributor tries to appeal to readers' sense of ethics, urging them to believe that the content they enjoy is well worth spending $ 1 a month. 
But this approach may be too little, far too late. 
People are already used to getting content online for free. 
As much as they hate ads and ad tracking, they hate paying for free stuff even more. 
It's not unlike what happened to the music industry back in the early 2000s. 
Once people realized they could download music for free, the industry had to take legal action against companies like Napster in order to convince listeners to start paying again. 
Now, easy and instant transactions through platforms like iTunes make the whole paying-for-music thing a little more palatable. 
What's more, fans are even beginning to come down on the side of artists, when they feel music platforms are robbing them of their fair share. 
The Spotify-Taylor Swift fallout is only the most recent example. 
The publishing industry is now finding itself at a similar crossroads, trying to convince the world that the articles and videos they're consuming are actually worth something. 
But appealing to people's ethical duty isn't a surefire way of winning over the masses. 
That's one reason why publishers like The New York Times, which has had moderate success with paywalls, have to charge a lot more than $ 1 a month for digital subscriptions. 
They count on the fact that some readers will do the cost-benefit analysis and decide that access to the Times isn't worth the money, and that's for one of the most highly respected publications on the web. 
Now imagine the challenge a publication like ScienceDaily would face if it started charging. 
And while Google's partner websites won't track contributors' behavior, that doesn't change the fact that every other website will. 
It's that widespread culture of data collection that will be the toughest to overcome .1 
Still, for all its potential drawbacks, Contributor could solve a lot of problems on the web today. 
It could save publishers who are struggling to stay afloat as ad dollars dwindle, while also giving consumers what they say they want. 
Now, we 'll have to see just how much they want it. 
1. 
Update: After publishing, Google amended its statement to WIRED on how user behavior will be tracked through Google Contributor. 
The story has been updated to clarify. 
Last year, a man named Carlin Dunne raced an electric motorcycle in the Pikes Peak International Hillclimb. 
He reached the summit in a blistering 10 minutes flat, handily beating his closest competitor through the mountain's 156 curves by 21 seconds. 
That kind of time is impressive for a gasoline-powered superbike. 
It is downright amazing for an electric motorcycle. 
There is now a street legal version of that beast, the LS-218 from Lightning Motorcycles. 
It was designed by two people whose names are synonymous with batshit insane electric motorcycles. 
It is not cheap, coming in at $ 38,800. 
But then, things like this rarely are. 
The LS-218's defining distinction is its utterly absurd top speed. 
It hit 218 mph at Bonneville, and yes, that was a one-time thing under tightly controlled circumstances, but it still hit it. 
It's also got the official electric motorcycle record of 215.96 mph. 
To put that number in perspective, the McLaren 650C tops out at 207, and the current king of street-legal, mass-produced two wheelers, the Kawasaki ZZR1400, ekes out a relatively paltry 186 mph. 
Of course, that kind of speed is only useful in a straight line. 
And a bike like this is all. 
About. 
The curves. 
If Dunne's sprint up Pike's Peak -- 156 turns over 12.42 miles -- is any indication, the LS-218 can stand tall alongside the best internal combustion machines. 
Back in 2011, the fastest electric two-wheeler to complete Pikes Peak finished a full 1:39 behind the first place finisher, a Ducati Multistrada ridden by none other than Carlin Dunne. 
Two years later he was back on a Lightning, and he proceeded to dust every motorcycle in the field. 
Yes, a lot of that can be attributed to the skill of the rider. 
But the LS-218 appears to have the kit, too: RaceTech fork, Ohlins shock, Brembo brakes, Marchesini wheels. 
Lightning claims the oil-cooled motor produces 168 pound-feet of torque and the equivalent of 200 horsepower, in a bike with a claimed weight of 495 pounds. 
The torque is nuts for a superbike, but the horsepower figures are par for the course at the top tier of performance motorcycles. 
Lightning, like Mission Motorcycles and Zero Motorcycles, is based in California. 
It's been playing with electricity since 2006 and, like Energica, started with racing. 
Antecedents to the LS-218 competed in events like the 2012 TTXGP/e-Power race at Laguna Seca and, of course, Pikes Peak. 
Now it's wading into the consumer market. 
The chief architects are longtime electric motorcycle innovators Eva Hakansson and Chip Yates who's also got a thing for electric aviation. 
Lightning, which is taking orders, just delivered its first bike to Troy Helming, a clean-energy executive who reserved one about a year ago. 
This being an electric motorcycle, the two biggest questions, after price, are how far it 'll go and how long it 'll take to charge. 
Lightning claims the standard 12 kW/hour lithium-ion pack is good for 100 miles at highway speeds, but based on our experience with electric motorcycles, you can expect 60 to 80 in real-world riding and maybe 40 if you're attacking the back roads. 
Lightning offers optional packs of 15 and 20 kW/hr, which bumps claimed range to as much as 150 and 180 miles, respectively. 
When the battery's dead, you're looking at two hours plugged into a Level 2 charger, which uses 220 volts like your dryer. 
The question remains as to how viable a machine like this is. 
You can buy a garage full of top-shelf motorcycles for 38 large, and your buddies will leave you in the dust after 40 miles of spirited back-road riding. 
But companies like Lightning and Tesla are showing that electric vehicles need not be boring. 
Here's hoping that Lightning, like Tesla, continues honing the technology's leading edge, and apply it to more mainstream machines. 
These days, you can hardly have a technology conversation without talking about the Internet of Things IoT. 
And when that conversation shifts its focus to the industrial sector, including energy, Oil & Gas, Power & Utilities, and petrochemicals, among others, the discussion changes to what is being called the Industrial Internet of Things IIoT. 
So what is all this hype about? 
The convergence of cheap processing, unending storage, massive bandwidth, near-ubiquitous connectivity, and cloud-based applications is driving new capabilities for gathering information and changing the way we interact with machines and services. 
The data generated by sensors in this network of connected devices is being collected and analyzed, spawning the growth of big data analytics and applications. 
And the resulting analytics are being used to improve business efficiency, better serve customers and disrupt old business models. 
There will be nearly 26 billion connected devices by 2020, according to Gartner, which is an increase of 30 fold over 2009. 
Impressive, but what does it really mean to have all these devices connected to the internet? 
Is there any real value involved? 
Just because you can, does it mean that you should? 
We all remember the technology boom and bust of the late 1990s and early 2000s aka Dot-com Bubble that was fueled by an excessive amount of wishful thinking or irrational exuberance. 
But the IIoT can and will be different -- if we keep our collective eyes on the prize. 
Unlike consumer-based IoT that is trying to devise a way to make your world a better place by telling you when your washing machine needs service or letting you control all of your home's systems while you are away, the IIoT is working to make our collective world a better place by improving the monitoring, control and safety of everything around us. 
In short, reducing risk and improving the reliability of our massive industrial systems. 
No small task given the amount of data that will be generated by all of those devices running around the clock. 
Think about it: How good is your computer without a good operating system to make all those programs function properly, or your smartphone without a million apps to connect you and your friends or coworkers and the information you share? 
Large hardware vendors recognized long ago that it is the software that makes the hardware more valuable. 
Software supports the human interaction side of the equation by helping to turn data into information. 
But not just basic information, I am talking about critical, insightful, influential, and actionable information, without which we run the risk of potentially dangerous outcomes. 
This next-generation software should be cloud-based because, let's face it -- on-premises solutions require significantly more time, money and resources than you would like to afford while trying to remain competitive. 
Advanced software should easily connect the existing enterprise asset management EAM or computerized maintenance management system CMMS with the field-based industrial devices and equipment. 
It should provide early, rapid insight into the volumes of data and information that mere mortals are expected to evaluate to find business opportunities and make recommendations as part of a larger asset performance management strategy. 
But more importantly, software should make it easier for your organization to achieve its highest objective: operational excellence. 
Even in today's increasing connected environment, industrial organizations do little more than make use of a minimal set of vendor-supplied analytics related to machine-specific solutions -- automated instrument calibration, instant vibration analysis of pumps and compressors, or other equipment related algorithms. 
The analytical capabilities of affordable processing and storage capacity in new software solutions are just beginning to be tapped. 
One key to discussing the software needs of the IIoT is to include asset performance diagnostics. 
More specifically, to take advantage of all the useful information out there and the connectivity promised by equipment and software vendors, we need to discuss asset performance diagnostics ; the ability to quickly assess a plant's equipment/asset status or ` health'. 
This ability can be critical for merger and acquisition activity versus building new. 
This implies that we must be able to check across many equipment types, not just one or two manufacturer-specific reports, in order to understand where our metrics stand in relation to our industry peers. 
Additionally, with next-generation software, organizations will gain enhanced asset reliability and comparative analysis for operational goals. 
Operators can perform better and faster analysis on collected data to report to the C-Suite executives, who then have better context for defining strategic goals. 
Comparative analytics provide the ability to internally compare the status and performance of the equipment or assets to get your own house in order and really ignite your continuous improvement initiatives. 
Next-generation software must help organizations take it to the next level. 
To get there, you need to benchmark your operations against your peers and competitors. 
That capability will help you move to the pinnacle of continuous improvement, and closer to overall operational excellence. 
There is an enormous amount of data generated today and as new sensors are introduced in global industrial facilities, big data will become even bigger. 
Organizations still struggle with how to leverage that data operationally and strategically to better manage reliability strategy, operational risk and facility operations, which is why we need to insert software into our discussion of the IIoT. 
Google and Facebook don't just run your email and your social network. 
So often, they're a core part of your online identity. 
They help you log in to countless other services across the net. 
This is a handy thing. 
You don't have to remember as many usernames and passwords, but it's also dangerous. 
You're putting all your eggs in one basket. 
What if your Google account gets hacked or suspended? 
Not only would you lose your email address and potentially everything tied to it, but you'd lose access all those other internet services too. 
And then there are the privacy issues -- you can't control how the data these companies gather about you is used. 
A new group called Indie Hosters wants change this. 
They want to give you a web identity that you have complete control over -- and they want to make it just as easy as signing up for Facebook. 
The idea behind Indie Hosters is to create a network of web hosts that use a set of common standards, take care of geeky technical details of maintaining your identity, and, crucially, make it dead simple to move from one Indie Hosting provider to another with no hassle. 
Each host will be an independent business, and you, not the host, will own and control your identity. 
Through these hosts, you can not only log in to a wide range of other websites, but also published your own stuff to the web. 
So far, there are only two members of the network, the project's founders Michiel de Jong and Pierre Ozoux. 
But they hope more hosts will join them, and today, the team launched a crowdfunding campaign to work on building the tools and network to make that happen. 
Indie Hosters is part of what's called the indie web movement, a loose knit bunch of programmers, designers, and activists who think you should own your own web content and online identity. 
For the past few years, indie webbers have advocated that everyone register their own domain name and use it to create your own email address and universal login system. 
There are plenty of alternatives to Google and Facebook's universal login that you can run from your own website, such as Mozilla Persona and OpenID. 
The problem has always been that setting up a server to run all this stuff is too technical for the average user. 
Indie Hosters tries to solve this by setting all this up for you on a server managed by someone who understands all this technical stuff, but who won't lock you in. 
Most web hosts already offer some sort of one-click installer to help you setup popular tools like WordPress. 
But Indie Hosters is trying to take this a step further by automating absolutely everything you need to manage your identity online. 
Instead of confusing users by making core features optional, all accounts will come with both a your own top-level domain, custom email forwarding based on that domain, and a TLS certificate -- the same standard that banks and retailers use to protect your credit card transactions online. 
And web identity software such as OpenID and Mozilla Persona will soon work right out of the box. 
At the same time, Indie Hosters will let you publish and build your own stuff on the web. 
At the moment, it offers only two publishing tools to start: the popular blogging system WordPress and a new, social-media-aware tool called Known. 
But de Jong says Indie Hosters will offer far more applications in coming months, ranging from personal cloud storage systems like OwnCloud to the Bitcoin-style application development system Ethereum. 
Traditional hosting services don't usually add new apps to their one-click installer packages until they 've become popular. 
That creates a paradox for new applications looking to gain traction among the non-geek set. 
de Jong hopes Indie Hosters can give these new applications a better chance of succeeding. 
De Jong and Ozoux aren't the only ones trying to make running a personal web server easier. 
The creators of Indie Box and Freedom Box hope to sell you a physical server that you can run from home, so that you don't have to trust any cloud provider. 
Meanwhile, Sandstorm, managed by ex-Googler Kenton Varda, is aiming to create a brand new open source web hosting platform that makes it far easier to manage servers in the cloud. 
Indie Hosters is focused on helping you own your identity, while Sandstorm is more about getting applications up and running quickly. 
To sign-up for Sandstorm, you need to use either a Google Account or GitHub account. 
Varda says that will change eventually, but the two projects clearly have different priorities. 
While Sandstorm is trying to build a new platform that makes managing servers much easier, de Jong says that he and Ozoux are trying to avoid writing any new software at all. 
Instead, they're trying to use the best software already available and writing automation scripts to manage everything. 
Varda says that although Sandstorm has more apps available on its platform now, the Indie Hosters approach will probably enable them to add new apps more quickly than Sandstorm can, since most apps need to be tweaked to run on Sandstorm. 
In the long run Sandstorm will offer a more transformative change in the way we run servers, Varda says. 
But the beauty of open source is that Indie Hosters can use Sandstorm's tools to improve its own offering. 
Then everybody wins. 
Scientists make this season's flu vaccine based on the strains of the virus that circulated during the last flu season. 
It's a flawed approach, but it's the best they can do given that it takes months to make the vaccine, and there's no way -- at least not yet -- to predict how the virus might evolve in the interim. 
But a new computer modeling study suggests the human immune system has a better memory than scientists had thought for strains of the flu it's encountered in the past. 
In the future, the researchers say, it might be possible to exploit this to design better vaccines. 
Every year, the flu wreaks havoc around the world. 
It typically infects millions of people around the world every year and kills up to 500,000 in a typical year. 
National economies lose billions of dollars to medical care and missed workdays. 
The flu vaccine helps soften the blow, but vaccine makers are in an arms race with the virus. 
The Global Influenza Surveillance Network orchestrated by the World Health Organization continuously collects samples from ill people all over the globe and in February each year chooses which strains to put in the vaccine. 
Months later, around November, people start rolling up their sleeves to receive a vaccine based on those one or two strains. 
But sometimes the virus mutates during the lag time between spring and fall, which renders the vaccine less effective. 
Smith thinks we can improve the vaccine, even if we can't accurately predict the flu's evolution yet. 
His new study published in Science today offers a new way to look at our immune system's reaction to influenza. 
The team tracked 64 people in Vietnam for six years, analyzing their antibodies -- proteins made by the immune system to flag invading pathogens for destruction -- when they were infected with the flu. 
They then created 3-D antibody landscape maps of each person's immune response, says research assistant and co-author Sam Wilks. 
In the figure above, the colored dots represent different strains of flu, and the space between the dots reflect structural differences between those viruses. 
The 3-D landscape blue shows the individual's varied immune response to all the strains peaks indicate high immunity, valleys indicate low immunity. 
The landscapes revealed something remarkable: when influenza infects someone, it not only triggers an immune response for that particular strain, but for all the strains of that type of flu that have ever infected the person. 
This phenomenon, named ` back-boosting,' means that our old immunity gets boosted every time we're faced with a new flu virus. 
Typically, the back boost response was stronger for past strains that were closely related to the infecting strain. 
The researchers think we make antibodies for past strains because our immune system's memories of past viruses are activated more easily than they'd thought. 
The findings suggest that the flu vaccine provides much more protection than anyone thought against past versions of the flu that have infected a person. 
Someone infected with the flu last year will still make antibodies for that strain, regardless of what version of the vaccine they receive. 
It's essentially a free pass, Smith said. 
This means scientists can try to predict how the virus might mutate an active area of research and base a vaccine on that, without worrying about diminishing protection against current circulating strains. 
If last year's strain is still around this flu season, a vaccine targeted for a novel strain will still offer a defense by stirring antibody production. 
This opens up the possibility for vaccinating against a future virus, explains Smith, We don't have anything to lose because it won't make the vaccine any worse. 
The back boost covers our backs. 
Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm agrees. 
This is potentially revolutionary work, says Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease and Research Policy at the University of Minnesota, We're a long way from changing our current policies, but this could really help. 
It also raises questions about how often do we need to be vaccinated if we can use this back-boost? 
It 'll be a while before a vaccine that takes advantage of the back-boost goes into a shot or nasal spray -- the approach still needs to go through clinical trials, which Smith hopes to get started on within a couple years. 
Until then, he recommends you get your flu shot anyway. 
Game of Thrones is coming. 
No, not the HBO show -- you still have to wait till 2015 for that -- but rather the highly anticipated videogame coming from Telltale Games. 
The first chapter of the game's six episodes is due out before the end of the year for PC, Mac, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and iOS. 
Today, we 've finally got our first look at the trailer, whose narrator sounds very much like actor Lena Headey. 
It also features some familiar faces: Cersei, Tyrion, Margaery Tyrell, Ramsay Bolton, and a guy getting tortured by Ramsay who may or may not be Theon. 
Originating from a minor house in the Vale, Maester Ortengryn studied at the Citadel in the hope of being assigned to the Eyrie. 
But by the time he'd earned enough links on his chain to graduate from acolyte, Jon Arryn had been murdered and the South was in turmoil. 
The Citadel ultimately assigned Maester Ortengryn to Ironrath, where he soon came to respect the Forrester family's honor and integrity. 
He now serves the Forresters with pride and has become a trusted advisor to the Lord. 
Built over fifteen hundred years ago by Cedric Forrester and his triplet sons, Ironrath is a testament to the strength and endurance of Ironwood. 
The Forrester house words are ` Iron from Ice', which echoes their belief that -- like the ironwood itself -- the adverse conditions and unforgiving landscape of the North only makes them stronger. 
The Forresters have come up in the books before though not the TV show, thanks to a passing mention in A Dance with Dragons. 
They're bannermen to House Glover of Deepwood Motte, and have long been loyal to the Starks, though we're told little beyond that. 
Ironrath is located in the Wolfswood, a massive forest that sprawls across the northwest of the North. 
It's also conveniently located on the edge of the largest ironwood forest in Westeros, giving the Forresters control of a valuable resource often used build weapons and ships. 
Fun fact: When Ned Stark beheaded that guy in the beginning of Game of Thrones, it was on an ironwood stump! 
We're told that their good fortune has attracted the particular jealousy of their sure-to-be-evil rivals known as House Whitehill. 
Indeed, the trailer involves some ominous threats from Cersei, who mentions how important the ironwood is to the Forresters and suggests that it would be a shame to let it fall into the hands of another house. 
I imagine you'd do anything to prevent that from happening, wouldn't you? 
According to Telltale, unspecified events -- likely relating to Cersei's threats -- will put House Forrester into a precarious position that could spell their doom. 
And perhaps ... send a protagonist on an exciting journey to achieve a thing? 
Throughout the course of the game, you 'll actually get to play as five different members of House Forrester -- either blood relatives or those serving them -- across both Westeros and the eastern continent of Essos. 
The qualification that not all playable characters are actual members of the family suggests that Maester Ortengryn may indeed be one of them, since he was merely assigned to the House by the Citadel, and not born into it. 
A previous teaser for the game included a quote from Storm of Swords mentioning squids in the Wolfswood and flayed men -LSB- riding -RSB- the Kingsroad, a reference to the Greyjoys and the Boltons in the North. 
The third season of the television show ends with Roose Bolton named Warden in the North, so chances are the Forresters will be asked to swear fealty to House Bolton -- and the man widely known to have betrayed and killed Robb Stark, their former lord. 
The Greyjoy angle is a little more uncertain, since Yara's doomed invasion to rescue Theon didn't take her anywhere near the Wolfswood the Bolton Dreadfort is located in the East though the Ironborn could still factor in in one way or another. 
Since the end of the fourth season also sees the arrival of Stannis Baratheon at the Wall, he -- and dare we hope, the Battle for Castle Black? 
-- could easily play a role in this Northern drama as well. 
Batman is a unique blend of so many things, says director Brett Culp. 
He's powerful, yet human. 
He's mysterious, yet relatable. 
He's heroic, yet broken. 
We love his action-packed adventures, but we have become fans because he is one of us. 
That one-of-us aspirational aspect of the Bruce Wayne character is essential for Culp, whose passion project documentary, out this week, took some three years to complete and features interviews with Batman movie producer Michael Uslan and former Batman comic editor Dennis O’Neil. 
It also has appearances from fans and academics explaining the appeal of the millionaire hero. 
It's too late for me to be born on Krypton, and I probably won't ever be bitten by a radioactive spider, Culp says. 
But, given the right motivation, I believe it's possible that I could be like Batman. 
Not to fight crime as a vigilante, but to do good and help other people. 
Batman is a constant reminder that I can be a hero in my own life, in my family, and in my community. 
Even without a mask and cape. 
There's no escaping the fact that, no matter how much of an inspiration Batman may be, he's also a massively valuable piece of intellectual property for DC and its corporate owner, Warner Bros., however. 
As Culp admits, we are living in an interesting time where our cultural stories are very intertwined with commerce. 
Nonetheless, he suggests, the character has survived the demands of the market surprisingly well. 
I sense that the majority of the filmmakers, writers, and artists who have worked on the character have a strong desire to honor his fans and expand the legend in positive ways, he says. 
Culp's own relationship with commerce includes the successful Kickstarter campaign to fund the documentary the project made $ 54,820, almost double its original goal, in 2013. 
I hoped people would want to join us, but I wasn't sure, he says. 
The true success of the Kickstarter campaign went beyond financial interests, Culp says, because it helped him build buzz early on and attracted many of the faces who make appearances in the documentary to the project. 
Following the publicity surrounding the campaign -- which included write-ups in USA Today and The Hollywood Reporter -- we were overwhelmed with potential stories, and so many of them were wonderful, Culp says. 
It was really hard to choose which ones to include. 
The result is a movie that's surprisingly uplifting for a documentary about a superhero known for dressing up as a dark avenger of the night and punching bad guys. 
That heartwarming effect goes beyond merely the movie itself ; since Culp finished working on it, it's been shown in charity screenings across the country, raising money for organizations including Make-A-Wish, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, underscoring the director's intent that the film follow in Batman's fictional footsteps to make the world a better place. 
I have more affection for Batman today than I did at the start of production, Culp says. 
I have seen again and again how Batman has been used as a symbol for wonderful, inspiring things, and that first-hand experience has affirmed my lifetime of affection for him. 
After working on this film, ` my Batman' is the 5-year-old kid who puts on a cape and runs into the backyard imagining themselves as a hero. 
For me, that is the most important Batman ; it's the Batman that will help shape the future. 
Up until yesterday, when you visited the App Store on iOS and browsed through free apps, the download button on the far right said Free in all caps. 
It made sense: The app is free to download, after all. 
But if you visit the App Store now, that Free button now says Get. 
This is being done to avoid confusion, and potential litigation, around apps that actually include in-app purchases. 
Earlier this year, Google ceased labeling apps as free if they included in-app purchases, following a request from the European Commission EC. 
The EC came out with four guidelines it wanted app stores and developers to follow: Games labeled as free shouldn't be misleading about actual costs ; they shouldn't exhort children to ask their parents to make in-app purchases ; they should inform users about purchasing practices and not allow purchases without explicit consent ; and app makers should offer an email address where users can file complaints. 
When this happened in July, Apple also agreed to make changes to its App Store, but never specified when. 
Apple already offers a number of safeguards against accidental in-app purchases. 
The Family Sharing feature in iOS 8 includes something called Ask to Buy, which is designed to ensure kids ask for permission before making iTunes or App Store purchases. 
The feature sends a notification to the parent's iOS device, where you can tap to grant permission or deny it. 
Otherwise, apps have to ask for confirmation that you want to make the in-app purchase before it goes through, and then you either need to enter your passcode or use Touch ID to validate the purchase. 
Previously, Apple settled with the FTC over rampant, exorbitant in-app purchases from minors when there were no safeguards against kids being able to make these purchases on their own. 
It also offered app users who suffered from this issue a way to get refunded. 
So now all iOS apps that are initially free to purchase have a Get button next to their title rather than a Free button, regardless of whether they offer in-app purchases or not. 
Google also changed the Top Free Apps and Top Free Games section headers to Top Apps and Top Games to comply with EC requests, but Apple has thus far left its Free app section titles unchanged. 
The Internet age has given us blisteringly fast connectivity to the World Wide Web, cloud computing, nearly instant collaboration and high definition face-to-face video communication with our peers around the world. 
Yet in terms of our rate of economic productivity, we have not only stalled in the past several years but also taken hugely dramatic dips. 
The promise of the Internet making everyone's job easier and boosting economic advancement has not been met. 
Why? 
The answer lies in a closer look at Solow's Paradox. 
The concept was first described in 1987 by economist and author Robert Solow, who stated, You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics. 
As it grew in popularity, Solow's Paradox became defined as the discrepancy between measures of investment in information technology and measures of output at the national level. 
In particular, it asks why the rate of productivity increase appears to be slowing dramatically in the Internet age. 
And that is undeniably true. 
According to an early November report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2014's third quarter business sector labor productivity increased at a 2.0 percent annual rate. 
Output increased 4.4 percent and hours worked increased 2.3 percent. 
From the third quarter of 2013 to the third quarter of 2014, productivity rose 0.9 percent as output and hours worked increased 3.0 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively. 
Looking at the year-over-year performance by quarter, that seems like good news. 
But taking a closer look, productivity actually declined steadily from a high of 8.3% in Q2 2009, including sizable dips of -2.7 percent in Q1 2011 and -- 4.5% in Q1 of 2014. 
An average productivity growth of 2.0% is something people actually might notice in their lifetimes. 
With the trends since 2009 showing steady decline over the past several years, however, what's really noticeable is that there seems to be no correlation between productivity and technological advancement. 
For me, it boils down to the fact that, compared to the technological innovations of the last industrial revolution electricity, automobiles, wireless broadcasting the Internet age just isn't that impressive. 
Technological advancements of the last century had a truly transformative effect over the previous industrial age. 
Ice farming was replaced by refrigeration, the horse and buggy by the automobile, burning of fossil fuels for energy by centralized electrical power production. 
These advancements were notable not just in what they achieved in themselves but how they affected society. 
What's more, consider that the average American worker's productivity soared at an average rate of 2.7% from 1939 to 2000. 
Among other reasons, the productivity surge occurred because the military industrial complex went from building more weapons to building more expensive, more sophisticated ones. 
This was a 20th Century idea, and came into its own with the advent of the Cold War. 
The USA knew it could never beat the Soviet Union or China by weight of numbers, but it could beat them with more efficient systems. 
This caused both the arms race escalation and the space race. 
In defense of today's technology, despite its ubiquity, some industry observers believe society has really only been in the Internet age for no more than 15 years. 
As a result, today's incredible advances in technology innovation have simply not had the time to effect society yet. 
With the every-quickening rate of change offered by the Internet, it is sensible to assume that 15 years from now we may see some more profound changes, on the order of those enjoyed across society in past periods of innovation. 
That is, of course, it we take advantage of the new technological changes available to us. 
Right now, we are not. 
People are afraid of rapid change, and when technological change happens faster than the investment cycle for a technology, major problems can happen. 
People will dig in their heels as a reaction to the newness of innovation. 
They will stick to old familiar processes, even when the new ones are faster, easier and more efficient. 
That's the equivalent of driving a horse-drawn carriage on the freeway. 
To avoid falling victim to Solow's Paradox over the long term, society as a whole -- and business in particular -- needs to think bigger. 
No longer can business think in terms of 10% improvement. 
Today's business leaders need to radically change their business process, and look for 10 times better process. 
Take advantage of the opportunities offered by the cloud and gigabit Ethernet, put the applications of the Internet age to work daily, across every aspect of your operations. 
That will spur a real revolution in how to do business. 
And only then might we be able to disprove and put to rest Solow's Paradox.

Italian firearms giant Beretta was founded in 1526 when Maestro Bartolomeo Beretta began producing rifles for the Arsenal of Venice, at a time when the city-state was a world power in the Renaissance rather than a honeymoon destination. 
Marc Newson, who recently joined Apple as a special adviser, has been working with the arms maker to design a shotgun, called the 486, for the modern age. 
The design of firearms tend to be a hybrid of high-technology and human-centered elements. 
Barrels are carefully fabricated to exacting standards, but the grips and shoulder stocks are artfully sculpted to fit human hands. 
Newson made it his mission to harmonize these two types of forms. 
The main focus for my design of the 486 was to simplify and rationalize all the surfaces, writes Newson. 
Specifically streamlining the area of the action. 
The Action is the metal hub where the trigger, reloading mechanism, and safety come together and serves as a showcase for Newson's design expertise. 
Trigger guards are often screwed-on pieces of sheet material, but Newson opted to mill his so that it becomes part and parcel of the gun's receiver. 
Cleverly, the 486's safety switch stands alone on the stock with a wood bridge hiding its connection to the receiver -- and thereby calling special attention to its lifesaving functionality. 
Similarly, the lever that unlocks the barrels for reloading was left uncluttered by decorative swirls to better reveal its critical role. 
The delicate, laser-etched engravings depict quails which were imported to Europe from Asia as game birds for hunting. 
Newson used them as an homage to the slaughtered flocks and an opportunity to add a personal dimension to the aesthetics. 
I am fascinated by Japanese culture and in particular the different comprehension of scale and detail, writes Newson. 
With this in mind I started to look at Japanese tattoos and the craftsmanship involved in creating complex engravings as a means to compliment the surfacing of the action. 
Newson's 486 pays tribute to company's nearly five-hundred year history, but is loaded with design touches that are only possible by leveraging modern technology. 
The stock and forend are are made of burled walnut, a material befitting one of Lord Fairfax's famous fox hunts, but feature precisely knurled grips produced using ultra-modern milling and robotic manufacturing tools. 
The result is the closest thing to the iGun we're ever likely to get. 
In making this assessment, account must be taken of the fact that Julian Assange is suspected of crimes of a relatively serious nature, the court said in its statement today. 
There is a great risk that he will flee and thereby evade legal proceedings if the detention order is set aside. 
In the view of the court of appeal, these circumstances mean that the reasons for detention still outweigh the intrusion or other detriment entailed by the detention order. 
The ruling forces Assange to remain inside the embassy or risk arrest and extradition to Sweden. 
But new pressures on Swedish prosecutors could force them to travel to London to interrogate him instead of requiring him to travel to Sweden. 
Assange has resisted going to Sweden for fear that he would face further extradition to the U.S. where a grand jury investigation is ongoing. 
These are matters for the -LSB- Swedish -RSB- prosecutor to decide on, but if she wished to travel here to question Mr Assange in the embassy in London, we would do absolutely everything to facilitate that, UK Foreign Minister Hugo Swire said. 
Indeed, we would actively welcome it. 
Swire insisted that his statement did not amount to a change in the UK's position. 
He acknowledged, however, that the UK government might not have been clear about its stance in the past. 
Assange asserts authorities told him he was free to leave, but when he did, they issued an arrest warrant for him. 
Assange sought exile from Ecuador because he believes the Swedish case is a trumped up attempt to get him extradited to the U.S. to face possible charges for his role in published documents leaked by Chelsea Manning. 
Assange, in his appeal to rescind the warrant, argued that although he had made himself available for questioning in the UK, the Swedish prosecutor has refused to accommodate that offer. 
This shows, Assange's attorneys argue, that the investigation has not been conducted with the effectiveness and urgency which can be demanded, and that what can be won by maintaining the detention order is not in proportion to the harm and damage the decision causes. 
that has deprived Assange of his liberty for more than two years. 
The head of the Swedish bar association called the showdown a circus and urged the prosecutor to compromise. 
It is time for this longstanding matter to be brought to a fair and proportionate end, Anne Ramberg, head of the bar association told the Guardian.

While Christopher Nolan was making Interstellar, he decided to show a model of the movie's bots to his kids. 
They were extremely disappointed. 
That's not a robot, they told him. 
That's a box. 
Well, it's true: Nolan's intelligent machines, which he dreamed up with production designer Nathan Crowley, look for all the universe like slabs of metal. 
The main bot, named TARS which doesn't stand for anything, might as well be a distant cousin of 2001 ` s monolith. 
Then again, nothing in Nolan's world s is what it seems. 
When I let my kids play with the model, open it up, see different combinations, he says, they started getting really excited. 
Let's peek inside the box. 
Locomotion | TARS is basically a robotic Kit Kat bar. 
His four fingers can execute a two-legged gait, a crutch walk, a scissor kick, and a full-on four-legged gallop. 
Appendages | When the bot articulates, his fingers can subdivide into smaller, identical appendages. 
In the movie, we see three subdivisions, but the CG team prepped up to five. 
By that point, the extremities were like toothpicks. 
Personality | You could describe TARS as the film's comic relief. 
In collaboration with Nolan, actor Bill Irwin decided to play the character somewhere between a marine company commander and a gym teacher. 
Special Effects | F/x coordinator Scott Fisher, whose team built the eight robots used for production, estimates that 80 percent of the bot footage in the final cut was shot in-camera, no CG required. 
When things fold out in a way that's impossible, he says, your eye catches it and you know it's fake. 
CG was reserved for acts of extraordinary robotics, like when a bot named CASE turns into a massive asterisk and tumbles through water. 
Materials | Weighing almost 200 pounds, TARS is an aluminum skeleton skinned in stainless steel. 
It took six weeks and about $ 20,000 to build. 
But a real-life TARS? 
It'd definitely cost more, Fisher says. 
Accounting, ya know, for the whole AI thing. 
Performance | Tars's dialog wasn't dubbed after the fact -- Irwin recorded it live. 
But that's not all: He also operated the hydraulics that controlled the heavy machines. 
Irwin is a few inches taller than TARS, which meant erasing his forehead in postproduction. 
During filming in Iceland, Irwin had to work in thigh-deep water, and the robots' metal corroded so badly that two models had to be disassembled and rebuilt. 
Face | TARS isn't supposed to have a face, but he does have screens. 
The cast couldn't help themselves. 
It was a natural point of focus for them, visual f/x supervisor Paul Franklin says. 
Despite our attempts to erase all traces of humanoid form from it, people look for faces. 
Rakesh Mathur is the newly appointed CEO of a startup that markets itself as Uber without the assholes. 
And that means he's having a very good week. 
Flywheel is a taxi-hailing app that works with existing taxi companies, and it has long promised to avoid not only the mudslinging and the sabotage that have characterized Uber's climb to the top of the startup ladder, but also the surge pricing that periodically ups the cost of its rides. 
A recent pitch from the company's PR firm described it as the no-surge, non-asshole alternative to Uber and Lyft. 
Mathur is a firm believer that despite the flurry of activity in the taxi hailing space, the traditional taxi industry is not going anywhere. 
In fact, even though the industry is quickly losing ground to companies like Uber, Mathur says that Uber is the best thing that's happened to the taxi industry. 
It made them realize they have to modernize, he says of taxi companies. 
Mathur hopes Flywheel can be the company to help the industry do just that. 
It won't be easy to compete. 
Though Flywheel has just raised $ 12 million in funding, that's paltry compared to the whopping $ 1.2 billion Uber recently raised. 
Meanwhile, Flywheel is only operational in San Francisco, with ongoing tests in Seattle and Los Angeles. 
Uber, by contrast, is live in 46 countries and counting. 
Flywheel was founded in 2009 as a backend management system for taxi companies. 
In 2013, the company pivoted to become a ride hailing app, but it kept its commitment to these companies. 
Now, instead of working with independent contractors like Uber and Lyft do, Flywheel acts as a consumer app that aggregates existing taxi fleets. 
That means it will never institute surge pricing, a policy Uber created to convince more drivers to get on the road at peak times, because taxi drivers work on shifts and don't have to be convinced. 
That problem doesn't exist, Mathur says. 
Uber does have a similar service, called UberTaxi, but it's not available in every market. 
Plus, Mathur says, by partnering with taxi companies at the same time Uber threatens to topple the taxi industry publicly, the company is, in effect, jeopardizing its own drivers' livelihood. 
You can't bash the taxi industry all the time, like Travis has done in some of his interviews, and still attract the hearts and minds, and pocket books if the people who are driving taxis, Mathur argues, referring to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. 
Still, all this hinges on the whether or not consumers actually care how much drivers are making or the fact that one Uber exec might want to spend millions of dollars digging up dirt on tech journalists. 
Sure, it's ugly. 
It's detestable. 
But the sad truth is, when it comes down to it, convenience and a good deal almost always trump ethics in a capitalist market. 
For evidence, see Wal-Mart. 
Uber's executives may have a relentless case of foot-in-mouth disease, and they may run sexist ad campaigns internationally, but when it's 15 degrees out, and you're standing in the freezing rain without an umbrella, the app that's going to win is not the one whose team is the most respectful of women if only! 
. 
The app that's going to win is the one that can send you a warm, dry ride before your extremities freeze off. 
People are going to go to the taxi apps that give them the right combination of convenience, price, and safety, says Rajeev Chand, managing director and head of research at the boutique investment bank Rutberg & Co. Whether that's a company that's dubbed by the competition as assholes or a company that has no public face at all. 
That's secondary in this market. 
Uber has the scale to be wherever you need it whenever you need it. 
That's not to say, of course, that Flywheel can't be successful. 
In fact, most experts agree that it's precisely because of that stuck-in-the-rain example that the taxi app industry is not a winner-take-all market. 
Mathur knows that as well as anyone. 
People will have Flywheel, Uber, Lyft and their hand in their air, he says. 
They're going to take whichever mode gets them the transportation the fastest. 
I can't help myself. 
I keep thinking of this io9 post with an interesting question. 
Let me refine it just a little bit. 
You are going back in time to the year 1234 AD to a location somewhere in Europe. 
For some crazy reason, you can bring one thing with you. 
What do you bring? 
yes, I have a loose definition of thing 
If you look around on the interwebs, you can find all sorts of pyramid type diagrams showing the needs of humans. 
Let me just make my own. 
Since I assume the first priority when going back in time is to survive, you would like to think about stuff that will help you with the bottom of the pyramid being the most important. 
Clearly you could only survive for a couple of minutes without air -- but that doesn't mean you should bring a space suit back in time but that might not be a terrible idea. 
I suspect that the at least the first 3 things air, water, food could be obtained in the past. 
Oh, what about the year 1234? 
This would probably be regarded as sometime in the Middle Ages in Europe. 
According to this Wikipedia page, the technology of the time included things like windmills and early mechanical clocks. 
There were cathedrals and castles for buildings and the military used bows and crossbows as well as heavy body armor. 
Gunpowder didn't appear in Europe until after 1300 so lets say it's not there. 
Written Knowledge. 
Bringing something with knowledge would be extremely useful. 
A book about medicine, agriculture or basic chemistry could be extremely useful. 
Maybe this book -- The Knowledge: How to Rebuild Our World From Scratch would be useful. 
But that's just one book. 
Maybe this other survival book might also be useful, but damn -- that would be two books. 
Electronic Book. 
A Kindle ebook reader would be another option. 
You could download a whole bunch of useful stuff. 
It would be your own personal library of knowledge. 
Too bad the Middle Ages are a lot like airports in the year 2005 -- not an electrical outlet anywhere. 
The Kindle product page lists the device as having a battery life of weeks. 
I suspect that's not good enough but it's better than the battery life of an iPad. 
An electronic device would be super useful, but you have to charge it. 
How could you charge a Kindle? 
I can think of two ways -- one of which might be considered cheating. 
The first way is to build a battery after you go back in time. 
It wouldn't be too hard. 
You just need an acid and two different types of metals here is an example battery made from pennies. 
It might be hard to find these materials, but I would suggest the first book on your Kindle be a book called how to build a battery from scratch. 
What about another method to charge your kindle? 
What about a solar panel on your Kindle? 
They actually make such a thing -- it's a Kindle case with a solar panel. 
Pretty awesome. 
You could load hundreds of useful books and just keep using the thing. 
Yes, you might consider this to be two things, but once you put the cover on the Kindle it might just count as one thing. 
A Weapon. 
Yes. 
You could bring a shotgun into the past. 
You might even be able do provide food and protection as well as clearly building a competitive advantage. 
I suspect that many locals might consider you to be too powerful to challenge. 
However, those that live by the shotgun might die by the arrow. 
It only takes one arrow and that's it -- you're dead. 
Plus, how much ammo could you bring? 
Even if it still counts as one thing, I think 20 shots would be about it. 
A Vehicle. 
Wouldn't it be nice to travel around? 
What better way to do this than with some type of vehicle. 
Does a motorcycle count as one thing? 
I think so. 
Here are some options for vehicles. 
Solar powered electric motorcycle. 
Something that can go off road would be nice. 
Armored Personnel Carrier -- you know, like a tank but on wheels and with more room inside. 
Yes, there is a problem with fuel -- but do you think if I had enough fuel for a few days I could eventually make more? 
Even if the thing ran out of gas, I could still live inside of it and it would offer great protection from the elements and other baddies. 
An awesome sailboat. 
Seriously. 
Wouldn't this work? 
It could almost certainly outrun any other boat of the time and you could live on it and travel. 
Maybe you could offer your services as a transportation person. 
You could travel to India and buy spices and bring them back. 
Why stop at a sailboat? 
Why not a nuclear powered submarine? 
Those things can run for quite a long time. 
Oh, but I might not be able to operate the thing. 
Wind Up Watch. 
That sounds silly, doesn't it? 
But just think how powerful you would be with a watch. 
They aren't battery powered, so you don't need to worry about that. 
But what can you do with a watch other than to know what time your favorite TV show comes on there's no TV. 
You can navigate. 
One of the biggest advancements in navigation was the invention of the watch. 
With an accurate time piece you can determine your longitude latitude is much easier to determine. 
You would be the king of navigation with a portable watch. 
Drugs -- the Useful Kind. 
Before the invention of antibiotics, you could get an infected scratch on your arm that could kill you. 
Really. 
A whole bunch of antibiotics would be very useful -- but is that one thing? 
Maybe a medicine bag would count as one thing. 
Also, you could keep some anti-itch cream in there. 
You know there must be many things that cause a rash. 
Some Other Ideas. 
Just for fun, here are some other things you could consider. 
A time machine. 
This way you could go Back to the Future and get some other stuff. 
A computer solar powered laptop. 
Sure, there wouldn't be any internet but you would have a bunch of knowledge and you could write some programs to calculate stuff. 
Smart phone. 
Again, solar powered. 
Even with a signal or gps, the thing would still have a camera and Angry Birds. 
Scuba diving gear -- or maybe a rebreather. 
Just think of all the useful work you could accomplish with this. 
Sunk boat? 
I 'll get that for you. 
What would you bring? 
How would your answers change if you went to the same time but a different location? 
A globe on a two-dimensional screen seems pretty dull compared to map projections that look like armadillos, butterflies, or deconstructed polygons. 
The azimuthal orthographic as it's formally known is hardly more than a snapshot of Earth from some distant point in space, right? 
Sure, except it was invented thousands of years before we had anything capable of flying into space to send back eyewitness accounts of our planet's shape. 
Before then, the only way to see Earth from an interstellar point of view was by combining math with crap-load of imagination. 
Most map projections bend and stretch the globe until it's flat enough to show the whole world at once. 
In other words, most map projections show you so much that they lose their perspective. 
The azimuthal orthographic is all about perspective. 
It also has geometric distortions, but only for tricking your brain into believing that the continents really are wrapping themselves realistically around the horizon. 
It is so good at doing this that it makes us see the world as if we were hundreds of thousands of miles away in space, and write the experience off as mundane. 
Or maybe the experience is mundane because it is so familiar. 
The azimuthal orthographic is thousands of years old. 
In the first century, Ptolemy described how a geographer named Hipparchus used the projection, which he called the analemma, to map the globe. 
Thanks to the jerks who burned down the Library of Alexandria, we don't have Hipparchus' original maps. 
Over the years, geographers toyed with the projection, but it was always overshadowed by other methods. 
It didn't get much attention until 1613, when a Belgian cartographer named Francois d’Aiguilon reintroduced the projection, and gave it the overwrought moniker we know it by today. 
D’Aiguilon was obsessed with the behavior of light. 
In his six volume treatise on optics, he presented the azimuthal orthographic as an extreme exercise in point of view. 
Imagining the azimuthal orthographic as looking down at Earth from a floating eye, d’Aiguilon figured that moving the eye up or down would change the distance to the horizon. 
In other words, the further you pull back, the more of the earth behind the horizon's curve you can see, to a maximum of exactly half of the planet even d’Aiguilon couldn't see around corners, mon ami. 
This was an extension of his work coming up with equations to measure how much a person could see from a given viewpoint. 
Carlos Furuti, a Brazilian cartographer whose website is an awesome resource for projections, shows how azimuthal orthographic projections can be used to calculate how much of Earth you can see at any altitude. 
For example, looking down from an airplane at 32,000 feet, you would be able to see about 221 miles in any direction. 
If you head up to the International Space Station, your view is increased to 1,250 miles. 
Impressive, but this is still only about 5 percent of Earth's total surface at a time. 
In order to get anywhere close to an entire hemisphere, our camera eye must retreat past the moon, over 230,000 miles away. 
But remember, Hipparchus, Ptolemy, and d’Aiguilon didn't need to know about airplanes, space stations, or even the distance to the moon in order to imagine how Earth's visible horizon would grow according to altitude. 
This is because they had imagination ok, trigonometry too. 
And their imaginations weren't limited to flying into the depths of space. 
The azimuthal orthographic has two sister projections that look at the earth in ways nature never intended. 
The first, called the gnomonic, has the imaginary viewing eye looking outward from the center of the earth. 
It has some cool navigational properties, but is perhaps most useful if you're trying to explain what the world looks like after smoking salvia. 
The second, called the azimuthal stereographic, also looks at the planet, but from an eye placed on the far side of the globe looking through it. 
Where the orthographic causes the continents to fall away, and the gnomonic stretches them into infinity, the stereographic moderately stretches them towards the edges. 
Their sizes are slightly off, but their shapes and arrangement stay true to life. 
As such, it's the most practical of the three, and is useful for teaching geography or plotting sea voyages. 
Not only does it make a pretty classy looking world map, Hipparchus also used it to map the stars. 
Nowadays, we tend to think of maps as tools for flattening the world and making its dimensions manageable. 
The azimuthal orthographic looked at the earth another way, by giving dimensions to the world's perceived flatness. 
The map might not tell us much about Earth that we don't already know, but it's an important reminder that only a few hundred people in all of history have every seen the earth's shape to confirm that it is, in fact, a globe. 
Apps and smartphones may captivate consumers and investors at the moment, but the future of technology will be much more dizzyingly weird. 
Chances are, the most radical innovations in the 21st century won't be built on silicon but on DNA. 
Over the past few years, the ease of crafting genes from scratch has gone way up, while the cost has gone way down. 
But while the curve of biology's version of Moore's law bends upward, major obstacles remain to the kind of startup explosion ignited in personal computing by better, cheaper digital technology. 
And the difference comes down to this: everything in Steve Jobs' garage was basically dry. 
Unlike other kinds of engineering, the essential materials of biotech are both wet and alive. 
And this makes working with them much more complicated than pulling out a laptop or a soldering iron. 
An effort is under way, however, to make working with wet stuff easier in the hope of putting biology on more equal footing with less viscous technologies. 
And one of the tools that has biohackers buzzing at the moment is the OpenTrons, an open-source liquid-handling robot designed to make biotech not just drier and faster but also a lot more accessible to anyone with an idea. 
The OpenTrons project originated at Genspace, a community biolab in Brooklyn founded in the DIY spirit of the Maker movement. 
Though genetic engineering technology has existed for decades, the practice of gene-splicing itself has mostly remained walled off within the confines of academic research institutions and corporate biotech. 
But enthusiast communities like Genspace have started to emerge around the world, inspired by the notion that putting biotechnology into the hands of more people could lead to a flourishing of creativity and discovery. 
Anyone who has ever worked in a biology lab or hung out in one knows the work can be tedious and repetitive. 
While the science itself is complex, the labor involved in experimenting and engineering largely consists of sucking liquid out of one vial with a handheld instrument called a pipette and squirting it back into another one. 
Our life science experts spend most of their time doing manual labor, Canine says. 
It's a huge bottleneck for research. 
As OpenTrons' creators point out, the process isn't just boring but also error-prone. 
Human eyes, hands, and brains just can't ensure the kind of precise consistency that a robot can. 
Lab robots are nothing new in biotech. 
But they tend to be incredibly expensive machines based on proprietary tech and intended for a narrow market of professional users. 
The OpenTrons, by contrast, is open source, meaning anyone can copy, build, and modify the tech as they see fit. 
Its brain is a Raspberry Pi microcomputer, which costs all of $ 35, and many of its other components built with off-the-shelf technology. 
The rapid rise of 3-D printing, Canine says, has led to a dramatic decrease in the price of the precision mechanical components needed to accurately transfer liquids. 
These components help keep the OpenTrons' price down to $ 2,000 for the basic model -- not trivial, but also less than the cost of a new iMac. 
The project, Canine says, also aims to the device's software as accessible as possible. 
Instead of a proprietary programming language, the OpenTrons uses a Javascript-based, drag-and-drop web interface for designing and running experiments. 
We're at the beginning of the digitization and automation of biotech, says Ryan Bethencourt, who helps run Indie Bio, an arm of SOS Ventures, which backed OpenTrons through its HAXLR8TR hardware accelerator. 
Bethencourt is also a backer of OpenTrons' Kickstarter. 
The beauty of OpenTrons is that it's built for researchers who don't want to program, who are used to modern and simple user interfaces. 
Canine's early hopes for OpenTrons may not sound glamorous. 
He's very excited about its potential to create standard, consistent lab protocols that yield regular, reproducible data. 
The very first thing for us is giving people the ability to email a protocol, he says. 
But he's also hopeful about the most ambitious applications for biotech. 
He says OpenTrons is working with Modern Meadow, which is working to print meat and leather without killing animals. 
He also sees great potential in synthetic biology, the branch of biotech working to stitch together novel organisms using one letter of the genetic alphabet at a time to brew everything from fertilizers to anti-malarial drugs. 
Whatever the application, Canine believes a better biotech future will be hastened the more hands and minds can be freed up from doing the grunt work of biology. 
Today people -- Ph.Ds -- spend most of their time moving tiny amounts of liquid by hand, he says. 
Our robot makes it so they don't have to do that. 
When a major law enforcement crackdown killed the Silk Road 2 earlier this month, it scattered the Dark Web's drug dealers. 
But one new and improved crypto market is welcoming and profiting from those refugees: an appropriately named website called Evolution. 
Since the FBI's and Europol's Operation Onymous seized dozens of Dark Web sites including the Silk Road 2, Evolution has more than tripled its rate of growth in new product listings, according to data collected by the non-profit Digital Citizens Alliance. 
That's helped the eBay-style contraband bazaar's drug offerings to grow more than 50 percent since September. 
Combined with the other products Evolution sells -- a mix of counterfeit documents, weapons and stolen credit card numbers -- it's now the biggest black market on the Dark Web. 
It has around 22,000 product listings in total, far more than either Silk Road 2 or the original Silk Road ever offered. 
Evolution is the new hot commodity, says Digital Citizens Alliance DCA research director Dan Palumbo. 
Clearly they're benefiting from the Silk Road 2 shutdown. 
Evolution was adding new product listings at a rate of between 80 and 90 a day before Operation Onymous, by the DCA's count. 
Since the seizure of drug markets including Silk Road 2, Hydra, Cloud 9 and Pandora, Evolution has now been adding around 280 product listings a day. 
Additionally, many Evolution vendors used to list their wares on Silk Road 2 as well, but now this will be the sole focus of their business, says Palumbo. 
Even before the Silk Road 2 was seized earlier and its alleged administrator Blake Benthall arrested, its popularity had been waning. 
It had been recently surpassed in size by not only Evolution, but also another drug site called Agora. 
As of a count of product listings by the DCA in late October, Agora was actually the top market on the collection of sites that run on the anonymity software Tor, with 18,250 listings. 
That was 2,000 more than the Silk Road and a few dozen more than Evolution, though Evolution's recent boost has allowed it to outpace Agora. 
Silk Road 2's plummeting market share resulted from a mixture of misfortune and incompetence: In early 2014 the site claimed it had been hacked, with $ 2.7 million worth of users' bitcoins stolen from its escrow services. 
Since then, it had offered no escrow at all, leaving buyers dangerously vulnerable to being scammed. 
Evolution doesn't just offer an escrow, but also takes advantage of a more advanced feature built into bitcoin known as multi-signature transactions. 
That feature is designed to prevent both scams and seizure of escrow funds by law enforcement. 
It requires two out of three parties -- the buyer, the user, and the site itself -- to sign off on a deal before the escrowed bitcoins can be transferred. 
Evolution has also had much faster pageload times than competitors, most of whom run painfully slowly thanks to Tor's process of routing web traffic among randomly chosen computers around the world. 
Just how Evolution managed those speeds despite running on Tor itself isn't clear. 
And it has been online far more reliably: The website Darknet Stats counts Evolution as online 97 percent of the time, compared with 83 percent for Agora and 93.5 percent for Silk Road 2 at last check in September. 
All of that has made Evolution the go-to haven for drug dealers fleeing the Silk Road 2. 
Another site calling itself Silk Road 3 in a bid to win over the Silk Road's users, by contrast, has less than a thousand listings. 
When someone calling himself the Dread Pirate Roberts held an ask me anything session in Reddit's dark net markets forum and claimed to be the new administrator of the Silk Road, he was mocked and asked questions like, Where do you plan on doing your upcoming stint in prison? 
Just how the new top black markets like Agora and Evolution survived the feds' Operation Onymous, however, isn't entirely clear. 
Some in the security community have speculated that the crackdown used a new de-anonymization attack against Tor, and that the only sites that were spared from that attack were those hosted in places like Russia or China, beyond western law enforcement's reach. 
In fact, the cops did seize one site calling itself Evolution: a scammy clone created to trick users into handing over their bitcoins. 
Security researcher Nik Cubrilovic has documented how as many as a third of sites seized by Operation Onymous were scam or clone sites, particularly knockoffs of many of the top drug markets including Agora and Evolution. 
By clearing out those clones, law enforcement may have actually cleaned up the Dark Web, removing fraudsters and making users feel safer spending their money on reputable black markets sites like Evolution. 
Evolution's rise in the Dark Web drug trade signals perhaps the final shift away from the political roots of the original Silk Road. 
The Silk Road's administrator known as the Dread Pirate Roberts, after all, espoused radical libertarian views and banned all but victimless contraband on the site. 
Evolution's creator, by contrast, is a mysterious figure known as Verto who previously ran the Tor Carding Forum, a credit card fraud site. 
And in addition to drugs, counterfeits and guns, Evolution also sells stolen credit cards, a kind of crime never allowed on the Silk Road. 
Evolution is the anti-Silk Road, says DCA's Palumbo. 
Rather than being centered around a libertarian ideal, it's just a business. 
If the new, post-crackdown Dark Web is darker, though, it's also smaller. 
Although Evolution has grown in the wake of Operation Onymous, the Dark Web drug market as a whole has been pruned dramatically to a total of about 44,000 listings compared with 65,500 listings in August, according to the DCA. 
That brings it below even the 46,000 listings on the sites in January of this year. 
But Palumbo says that given how fast the Dark Web grew over the last year, that setback isn't likely to last. 
If I had to guess, I would imagine you 'll see new sites pop up, and someone will take place of Silk Road as the third major market, he says, I wouldn't be shocked at all to see them overtake the total number of listings before the takedown. 
At the time, a technology known as virtualization was becoming easier to implement on PCs, allowing anyone to create a miniature operating system, known as a virtual machine, inside their main operating system. 
Rutkowska manipulated virtualization into a mind-contorting weapon called a Blue Pill attack. 
Without them knowing, her rootkit moved the victim's entire OS into a virtual machine controlled by the hacker, allowing everything the target did to be watched. 
The victim's digital world would suddenly exist inside an alternate reality, and no amount of antivirus or antirootkit scanning could break the system out of that aquarium. 
Your operating system swallows the Blue Pill and it awakes inside the Matrix, Rutkowska wrote in a blog post explaining the trick. 
Eventually she honed the maneuver so that not even launching another virtual machine inside the Blue Pilled system would glitch the illusion -- her attack supported a dream within a dream. 
Joanna Rutkowska | The metahacker turned the notion of spyware -- and defenses against it -- inside out. 
Joe McKendry 
But as years passed, no real-world instances of Blue Pill attacks were discovered, even after other researchers developed tests capable of detecting the technique. 
Rutkowska's explanation? 
For normal spies and cybercriminals, ordinary rootkits work just fine. 
There are still so many places in a Windows kernel to hide traditional malware, she says. 
I was as vulnerable as any other user. 
This was annoying. 
So Rutkowska flipped the game, this time in favor of the defenders. 
Four years ago her Warsaw-based firm, Invisible Things Lab, started developing its own operating system known as Qubes. 
The free open source OS lets users set up a collection of virtual machines on their PC, with a simple central interface to manage each quarantined system. 
Careful users can keep their personal online activities isolated in one virtual machine, for instance, while they do their work in another, and their banking in a third. 
Rutkowska typically runs about 15. 
Open a malicious email attachment or click on an infected website and the malware can't break out of that one contaminated container. 
If it works as promised, even NSA-level exploits would be contained to a single compartment in Qubes' architecture, one that could be evaporated and re-created at will. 
Recovering from even the nastiest hacker attack, in other words, could soon be as easy as waking from a bad dream.

The cargo trucks criss-crossing India are brash, psychedelic folk art. 
They're covered from bumper to bumper in religious iconography, talismans, and all manner of elaborate motifs, prompting the men behind their wheels to affectionately call them their painted ladies. 
With a lot of the truck drivers there's a little bit of machismo, said Eckstein. 
They're smoking cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and listening to their music. 
There's a feeling of adventure and the open road. 
The drivers had a bit of swagger and were quite serious when he made their portraits, but that melted away as soon as they saw their photos on the back of his camera. 
Then they were all smiles. 
The trucks are drivers' homes for weeks at a time while they haul goods all over the country. 
They work in teams of two or three, driving in shifts, taking turns sleeping in bunks, and having meals at simple truck stops along the way. 
Whether Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, or Christian -- there's usually ample evidence by the illustrations on the tailgate, sides, and the shrines installed in the cabs. 
If a driver is from the north, his good luck garlands may include chiles and limes. 
If he's from the south, conch shells replace the chiles. 
Talismans against the evil eye include devilish faces or the image of a shoe, all carefully hand-painted. 
It's a little hectic, Eckstein said. 
There's every kind of vehicle -- ox-drawn carts, shepherds bringing flocks through the highway, and cows wandering around. 
People don't stick to one lane or another. 
The trucks are bold expressions of individuality and repositories of masculine, laboring pride. 
Drivers treat their rigs as evolving works of art, periodically commissioning a new illustration from roadside artists like one might collect tattoos. 
The title Horn Please was inspired by the ubiquitous request painted in stylized lettering on the back of nearly every cargo vehicle. 
The many variations of the phrase encourage car drivers to sound their horn in alert when they plan to pass a truck, though Eckstein claims no encouragement is necessary. 
In India, the horn is going constantly to let everyone know where you are and where you're going, he says. 
It's an essential tool for navigating the road. 
The song comes from their 1979 album Fear of Music and seems to be set in an urban dystopia with bands of freedom fighters skulking in the shadows. 
There's meager rations, a cacophony of gunfire, and street-level espionage. 
In short, everything one might expect in a song about a post-apocalyptic wasteland. 
Like I said, better pick up this track on cassette just to be safe.

A potash mine in the Perm region, Russia, has collapsed, leaving behind a gigantic sinkhole in the middle of an abandoned town. 
It's scary but that's not the real bad news: a connected mine just few miles away sits right underneath a town full of people and houses and experts say it may collapse too. 
Earlier this week, RT reports, Uralkali's Solikamsk-2 potash was evacuated because of a sudden influx of salty water. 
Then, the sinkhole appeared, proving just how unstable the ground is. 
An underground tunnel plugged only a concrete barrier links the mine to Solikamsk-1, which is the second mine that sits under an inhabited town. 
Yeah, it's probably a good time to get the hell out. 
It's one of those Thanksgiving fun facts I loved repeating when I was a kid: Ben Franklin liked turkeys so much that he wanted them to be our national bird, instead of the bald eagle. 
It's a popular fun fact. 
But I was shattered to learn as an adult that this little nugget of trivia isn't quite true. 
So where does this myth come from? 
Back in 1784, Franklin wrote a letter to his daughter in which he disapproves of the country adopting the bald eagle as our national symbol. 
He claims that the drawing that had been produced looked like a turkey anyway and that such a bird would actually be preferable to the eagle. 
Franklin explained that the bald eagle had a bad moral character and was a rank coward that merely steals from other birds. 
I am on this account not displeased that the figure is not known as an Eagle, but looks more like a Turkey. 
For the truth, the Turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird, and withal a true original native of America ... He is besides, though a little vain and silly, a bird of courage, and would not hesitate to attack a grenadier of the British Guards who should presume to invade his farm yard with a red coat on. 
So yes, he did float the idea that a turkey might be a better bird for a national symbol. 
But only within the context that people were claiming the bald eagle symbol already looked like a turkey. 
He never actually advocated this notion publicly or seriously. 
So feel free to play the obnoxious pedant over Thanksgiving dinner after everybody is nice and liquored up. 
But make sure you yell DEBUNKED as you flip over the dinner table. 
FACTUALLY RULES, is also acceptable. 
Have you ever filled your teapot up more than halfway in your life? 
Oh, you have? 
Well, not all of us are constantly having wild parties with dozens of friends for whom to make tea. 
The rest of us are usually only making one or two cups -- and that's who the design team at the Dutch studio Droog made this teapot for. 
It's called Tea for One alternate name: Forever Alone Pot, and it got several layers of jokes attached to it: First of all, it's a play on the classic Utah teapot found in many 3D-modeling softwares. 
Second of all, it's part of a collection of objects that were designed for a gallery show about copy-cat design. 
The designers took a classic Chinese design and chopped off part of the body -- it's just different enough, but still virtually a copy. 
Anyways, if you're interested in the conceptual underpinnings of this particular teapot, you can read more on Droog's site. 
Everyone else can pick one up here.

You can do some crazy shit with satellite imagery. 
What kinds of crazy shit? 
Well, for one, a startup's spying on the shadows of half-built skyscrapers in China and then selling the data to investors who want to predict what the real estate market. 
That's crazy! 
The startup is run by former Googler James Crawford, the guy who was once in charge or scanning millions of books and making them searchable. 
Crawford's new company, Orbital Insights, offers a whole menu of services that take advantage of the, uhhh, insights offered by time-stamped satellite imagery, The Wall Street Journal reports. 
The Journal reports that Orbital Insights is not only monitoring construction sites in 30 Chinese cities but also watching farms to see what kinds of crop yields they might produce and analyzing the parking lots of big box stores so that their competitors can try to guess their sales numbers. 
Apparently, hedge funds are willing to buy this kind of data in troves. 
This is surely only the beginning. 
Now that Google is giving away satellite images for free, we should be expecting all kinds of crazy business models to pop up. 
And as cubesats become cheaper and more prevalent, we 'll certainly see some insane innovation in the arena of real-time satellite images. 
Then, all of your Enemy of the State-inspired nightmares will come true.

Ikea is over 70 years old, which means the company has survived through dozens upon dozens of design trends, from stuffy conservatism in the late 1940s to the craziness of the 60s. 
Wonderfully, the company is now plucking classics from its archives to sell in some stores. 
As one of the only mass-produced furniture companies to survive this long, Ikea is at a distinct advantage when it comes to the vintage crazes of today's consumers. 
Because it doesn't need to draw up faux-retro designs based on the past -- it can just re-issue the original pieces that sparked those trends. 
And so they have: Starting earlier this year with a collection called ÅRGÅNG, made up of more than 20 pieces. 
We took the liberty of pairing some of the designs with the archival catalogs kept on the Ikea communication team's excellent Pinterest that they originally belonged to, accompanied by some text from those catalogs that Ikea released with its press materials. 
They're all limited edition, but don't fret if you missed one -- if you live long enough, they 'll probably come back around. 
In the company's own words, it's the IKEA circle of life. 
Originally called SILA, here's how this pendant lamp was originally described in the 1959 Ikea catalog and poorly translated by Google: SILA filters the light to a mild and pleasant light over your table. 
A nice and dashing the news that the modern youth certainly become fond of. 
You know how modern youth can be. 
Today Ikea is selling this chair under the name Strandmon, but it hails from 1951, when it was known as MK and appeared in the earliest Ikea catalog. 
Back then, the company said that the chair represents the best Swedish furniture industry has to offer. 
It is soft and comfortable to sit in and gives full rest to the whole body. 
Recommended for those who want something extra in terms of style and quality. 
As we wrote last year when Ikea reissued this little leaf-shaped table, today known as Lövbacken, this is the product that actually inspired Ikea's flatpack stance. 
In 1956, the designer was trying to fit it in his car -- so he sawed off the legs and reattached them later. 
Even in the 1950s, neighboring Denmark had enviable furniture chops. 
This set from 1957 was designed to cop to the Dane-bred style of the day. 
You can tell right away that this group is Danish, but what is the reason for the typical Danish style? 
, the 1957 catalog explained. 
Well, we can reveal, the Danes are artists that treat the wood, producing silky luster of their furniture. 
Group ESBJERG is a good representative of the best in Danish furniture art, just look at its restrained simple lines and sinking down into the really soft cushions. 
Today it's called EKENÄSET, and it's just as stylish as it was almost 70 years ago. 
Here's one Ikea catalog that shows a very similar design in 1959. 
Las Vegas must 've seemed quite glamorous in Sweden of the late 1950s -- which would explain the name of this trestled coffee table from 1957. 
Ikea called it fresh and chipper, and an ultra modern creation for present and future. 
It was right: This almost 70-year-old table looks similar to what you'd find in the average furniture boutique today. 
This chair was actually designed by the architect Jorge Ferrari-Hardoy in the early 1940s, and it's been knocked off so consistently over the past six decades, it won't feel retro at all. 
In 1959, Ikea's own so-called Butterfly chair was sold to consumers as an outdoor chair for indoor use. 
Why not in the modern living room or youth room? 
, Ikea asked of its sustainable and ` fun' chair. 
You could sit freely for 27 kroner, which by today's conversion rates would work out to about $ 3. 
Adjust for inflation, that's about $ 25. 
It goes for $ 30 on Ikea's website, a little more than the original. 
But then, a lot has changed since Ikea first started selling it to the Swedish public in 1959. 
I signed up for Spotify three years ago, the day the service launched in the United States. 
$ 400 in subscription fees later, I'm still a member, and I 've never regretted the money for a second. 
But for the first time since joining, I'm actually tempted to leave. 
YouTube Music Key might just win me over. 
I have tried basically every possible streaming music service. 
Not just because it's part of my job, but because I'm a music nut and I want to use the best. 
I 've never felt a compelling reason to leave my original Spotify subscription behind. 
I 've come close and really like some competitors, but in the end all services have basically the same catalogs. 
They all use variations on the same discovery and recommendation systems. 
For whatever neat interface improvement or deep cut catalog nugget I could find in competitive streaming services, ultimately there was never enough of a reason to stomach the inconvenience of transitioning to something new. 
Spotify had my playlists and my playback history. 
Plus, it has the most subscribers in the United States, so I 've got a lot of friends on board, too. 
And then Google introduced YouTube Music Key, which gives YouTube all of the functionality its users have been clamoring for. 
First, you can watch music videos without any advertisements, so no more pre-roll before every darn Vevo hit. 
Second, you can now cache videos and playlists for offline playback on your phone. 
And finally, music will now continue to play in the background even when you switch to another app or lock your phone. 
All of that, plus you get access to a full Google Music subscription, which is basically a Spotify clone. 
Once trials and introductory pricing wear off -- you can get in for $ 8/month for a limited time, and the first six months are free -- the whole shebang will cost $ 10 per month, the same exact amount as Spotify. 
In other words, you get the regular subscription music service you would be paying for anyway, plus a suite of neat new features that no one else can offer. 
YouTube Music Key might just the compelling feature that actually differentiates it from the glut of otherwise identical services. 
I'm currently paying for both Google Music/YouTube Music Key and Spotify, and I'm having a hard time deciding which one I 'll stick with. 
My ties to Spotify are so deep that I never really though it would be a question. 
Hydrogen fuel cells are a cool technology that were perfected to enable humans to go to the moon. 
Now that they're perfected even more, they're enabling humans to go to work or the liquor store, and, incredibly, this is progress. 
The Toyota Mirai is an example of this remarkable progress. 
Funny looking, maybe, but it works. 
Let's just get the way it looks out of the way right up front: the Mirai is sort of ugly. 
I do appreciate that it doesn't look like everything else out there -- I appreciate that a lot -- but I don't think I can say the design is successful as such. 
I think the profile isn't bad, and I like a number of the details -- the black beltline, the handling of the C-pillar -- but those massive and mostly fake side intakes are just so distracting and brutal-looking. 
In white, it makes the car look like a Stormtrooper's helmet. 
Now, it's worth remembering that the Mirai is set to sell for $ 57,000, I think they did the right thing -- just maybe not in the best way -- by making the car look dramatically different. 
You don't want to spend nearly $ 60 grand on a technologically advanced car and have it just look like any old Prius. 
You want people to know that you live in the fucking future, people. 
The FUTURE. 
The look is supposed to emphasize the intaking of air, and it certainly does that. 
And, really, this car does take in a crapload of air, some of which it uses to combine with Hydrogen to make water and electricity, and some of it is used to keep all that electricity and water making equipment cool. 
The Mirai has four separate radiators/condensers and cooling loops, in fact: 
Technically, the Mirai is a very interesting car. 
The fundamental principles are the same as in other fuel-cell cars, but unlike fuel-cell vehicles like the Hyundai Tuscon, the Mirai has been designed from the ground up, on its own proprietary platform, to be a fuel-cell car. 
That way, all the components can be distributed throughout the chassis for optimal packaging and weight distribution. 
In the Mirai, the layout has the 153 HP motor and controller units up front, the fuel cell stack under the front seats, the hydrogen tank under the back seats and the storage battery behind the rear seatback. 
There's a lot of hardware all along the length of the car, but despite that the interior seems fairly roomy. 
The rear seat floors have a sort of strange ramp-up where they meet the bottoms of the front seats, and the back seatrest won't fold down thanks to tanks and bulkheads, but there's decent room. 
The only real novel control that reveals it's fuel-cell nature is a lone button marked H20 that lets you purge the waste-water resovoir. 
In essence, it's a button to make the car pee. 
I still can't believe they're not storing the water in some clean radiator and then providing an on-dash water tap, but they claim it doesn't taste that great. 
Well, what if I just want it for washing purposes? 
Or to make Kool-Aid? 
Did you think of that, Toyota? 
It starts and feels like any electric car -- that is, pretty quietly, with maybe a bit more whirrs and hums from the fuel-cell components. 
Taking off in gear, I actually managed to chirp the wheels a bit, to the surprise of myself and the Toyota people with me. 
So that's fun. 
Driving around a little loop in downtown LA, this thing just feels like a bigger Leaf, or Plug-in Prius in EV mode. 
It's fine. 
Acceleration is decent, and sure, it's heavy, but not so much that it actually feels ponderous. 
And when it comes to filling those tanks, right now some customers -- Toyota doesn't really specify the criteria as to which customers they mean, but I suggest you dress in something sexy when you ask -- get three years of free hydrogen. 
This is partially due to the fact that the method of selling hydrogen isn't really worked out, and is basically the same as what Hyundai is doing. 
It tastes fine, I thought. 
Maybe a little outdoor-hose-water-ish, but that's more the result of all the pipes and plastic and metal it's flowing through. 
I think the water itself is just that, pure water. 
So they should still pump it into a tap on the dash. 
And, if they did, then that could be the only really unusual-seeming thing about driving this car, compared to almost any other electric or hybrid car. 
The problem of making a viable, usable hydrogen fuel-cell car is clearly solved. 
Now we just have to figure out the whole hydrogen distribution part, and that's a much bigger deal. 
People ask us all the time whether they should buy a new-gen console? 
Should they get an Xbox One? 
A PS4? 
For a year, we 've told people to not bother with either. 
Now, we think you should make the leap, especially if you're a console-only gamer. 
But which one to get? 
We're not going to tell you which one is better, because, frankly, it's an unresolvable debate. 
PS4 vs. Xbox One? 
There are good things and bad things about both machines. 
In fact, it's a little surprising how the rivals have leveled off. 
For most of the last year, we were far more impressed with the PS4 last year than we were with the Xbox One, but a series of software improvements and smart business decisions by Microsoft has closed the gap between the consoles. 
In late 2013, the sleek, powerful PS4 wowed us more than the chunky, clunky Xbox One. 
A year later? 
We think it's a more even fight. 
Nevertheless, the PS4 and Xbox One are not identical, so we 've got some comparing to do. 
Hopefully the comparison will help you determine which console is better for you or whether you might want to go all in and get both ... or neither. 
A note about Nintendo's console: Nintendo's Wii U has evolved into a superb console of its own, but is by and large a Nintendo machine. 
Want to play wonderful, new versions of Smash Bros., Mario Kart, and Pikmin? 
Want to play excellent sequels, such as Super Mario 3D World and the surprise Nintendo-exclusive Bayonetta 2? 
Want to do any of this on a console that lets you play the games on a handheld screen if your TV is being used for other stuff? 
Pay the $ 299 Nintendo tax and get a Wii U. Dwindling third-party support means that there is virtually no more overlap between the games released for XboxOne/PS4/PC and Nintendo's home console. 
A good thing, because you won't feel like your devices are redundant, but a bad thing, because you 'll need to buy more expensive stuff to play every game. 
A note about PC gaming: If you have a good gaming PC or are interested in getting one, you may not need a PS4 or Xbox One yet. 
Most of the top games on the new-gen consoles -- including such buzzworthy late-2014 games as Dragon Age Inquisition, Shadow of Mordor, Assassin's Creed Unity and Alien: Isolation are all available on PC. 
Many of the consoles' best indie games, like Transistor, Don't Starve, TowerFall: Ascension and Super Time Force are also on PC. 
Skipping the new consoles now and sticking just with a PC won't cost you access to that many exclusive games yet you'd basically just miss the Sony-published PS4 games and some, but not all of the Microsoft-published Xbox One games. 
So if you can live without playing Infamous Second Son PS4, LittleBigPlanet 3 PS4, Sunset Overdrive Xbox One, and Halo: The Master Chief Collection Xbox One and you 've got a good way to play the best new games on your TV -- and if you don't mind waiting until early next year to play the superb new first-person-enabled version of Grand Theft Auto V -- then stick with PC gaming for now. 
They're both pretty beefy. 
The Xbox One and PS4 are both powerful consoles. 
The best-looking games for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 -- Halo 4 and The Last of Us, arguably -- are already visually outclassed by the likes of the new consoles' versions of Shadow of Mordor, Assassin's Creed Unity and Grand Theft Auto V. 
They're not identical, but it's close. 
The specs for the consoles are not identical, and close analysis of this first year's games has regularly revealed a small performance advantage for the PS4 higher resolution graphics, for example, the kind you might notice if looking at the game running on each console side-by-side. 
But Xbox One games tend to look phenomenal as well, and in at least one case -- Assassin's Creed Unity -- seem to perform better on Microsoft's console. 
History shows that developers get better at programming for consoles as the years go by, which would either close any performance gaps or accentuate them. 
It's too early to say. 
Games cost the same. 
Major game releases cost $ 60 each on both consoles. 
They 've got mostly the same third-party games. 
The PS4 and Xbox One run many of the same games and largely have parity in terms of third-party support. 
All major games from Ubisoft, Activision and Take Two have come to both consoles. 
EA released the multiplayer shooter Titanfall exclusively on Xbox platforms and Microsoft secured console exclusivity for Dead Rising 3 from Capcom and the next Tomb Raider from Square Enix/Eidos possibly a timed exclusive there. 
The massively multiplayer Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is available for PS4, not Xbox One. 
Otherwise, from existing blockbusters such as Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, FIFA and GTA to next year's Metal Gear Solid V, Evolve and The Division, big third-party games come to PS4 and Xbox One and generally on the exact same day. 
There aren't many exclusives on either side. 
Neither system has an overwhelming number of exclusive games yet, so PS4 and Xbox One owners would likely still find a lot of overlap in their software collections. 
They both update when they're turned off. 
Both of the new consoles are designed to patch and update your games the PS4 does this more smoothly at the moment. 
Both have somewhat cluttered but well-stocked online stores. 
They each ship with 500GB hard drives and require just about every game to be installed the Xbox One supports external hard drives ; the PS4 does not, though the PS4 HDD is pretty easily swappable for a bigger one. 
They both let you start playing most games while they're downloading or installing. 
Achievements and trophies are still a thing. 
They both have Achievement-like systems. 
As has been the case for a while, Sony calls theirs Trophies. 
They both support cross-game voice chat for parties of up to eight people. 
Cross-game chat was previously something the Xbox 360 could do that the PS3 couldn't. 
You can use your real name on both. 
In a change from the previous generation, both allow players to be identified by their friends by their real name instead of by a handle. 
This is optional, so you can keep masquerading as CoolBro420 if you want to. 
Both controllers are similar to their predecessors. 
They each have evolutionary controllers that are similar to the ones from the previous generation, though the PS4's new DualShock 4 feels like the more substantial design overhaul when compared to its predecessor the DualShock 3. 
The Xbox One's controller includes more advanced force feedback rumbling, and it runs off of AA batteries. 
The PS4's controller has a colorful light bar, a touch pad, and a speaker, and runs off of an internal battery that you 'll need to regularly recharge thankfully, unlike the PS3, the PS4 lets you charge your controller while the system is in sleep mode. 
None of those features have amounted to anything all that special, so, for controller preference, it's still largely a matter of which one you personally prefer. 
Additional controllers for both consoles cost $ 60 each. 
They both charge players for online multiplayer. 
You need PlayStation Plus for the PS4 $ 50 annual subscription and Xbox Live Gold for the Xbox One $ 60 annual subscription. 
Both paid services give you games. 
Both the PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Gold services give players access to free games each month and let you keep the games as long as you're a subscriber. 
Because there are relatively few new games out for the new consoles, the freebie games for PS4 and Xbox One tend to be indies, whereas the freebie games subscribers can get for last-gen consoles tend to be bigger releases. 
For example, in November 2014, Gold users can get a game called Volgarr The Viking for free on Xbox One but also get Viva Pinata: Trouble In Paradise and Red Faction: Guerilla for the Xbox 360. 
That indie/big-game divide isn't always the case, though. 
Keeping it a bit more indie all around in the same month, Plus members get The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, Steamworld Dig and Escape Plan originally for the PS Vita for free for PS4, but also Frozen Synapse and Luftrausers for PS3. 
And in December, PS4 users of Plus will get free copies of the big-budget DC Comics fighting game Injustice. 
They're both indie-friendly. 
Sony and Microsoft have both aggressively courted indie game developers and have been rolling out indies on their platforms Nintendo's been getting into this, too but, of course, the PC is still by far the leading platform for anyone who wants to play great indie games. 
Neither one is backwards compatible. 
Neither system will run a game disc from the previous generation, though the PS4 does offer last-gen games via a streaming program that will be explained below. 
Both offer cameras of limited utility. 
The Xbox One used to ship with a Kinect sensor that could be used for voice and gestural control of the system's interface and in many of its games. 
The Kinect is no longer packed in and has seen few games made that require it standouts include Dance Central Spotlight and Disney Fantasia: Music Evolved. 
It costs over $ 100. 
Sony's PlayStation 4 Camera $ 60 allows for some voice control of the system. 
Both devices allow users to log into their respective consoles via facial recognition. 
Neither feels essential to the new-gen console experience. 
Both normally cost $ 400. 
When the Xbox One launched, it cost $ 500, $ 100 more than the PS4. 
But the removal of Kinect from the console's base offering dropped the two machines down to the same price, $ 400. 
Microsoft is currently running a holiday promotion that drops the Xbox One down further to $ 350. 
Both machines are often bundled with games. 
Both let you stream lots of different media. 
Both machines support a variety of media-streaming apps. 
They both have Netflix and Amazon Prime. 
and Hulu Plus. 
There are some notable differences: Xbox One has HBO Go, which the PS4 doesn't yet have. 
The Xbox One also has an NFL app of limited utility. 
The PS4 is slim, the Xbox One is chunky. 
One of the biggest differences between the PS4 and the Xbox One is that, well, the PS4 is a slick, slender console and the Xbox One is the Duke controller of game consoles. 
The PS4 lets you play streaming PS3 games it costs money. 
The PS4 lets users play PS3 games through the recently-launched PlayStation Now service. 
You can stream any of a number of games if your Internet connection is fast enough to handle a two-way streaming signal you're basically remotely playing on a PS3 that is in some server farm somewhere. 
The games will support your older PS3 save files, but you have to pay to access these games, even if you owned them. 
The Now service is pricey. 
Four-hour rentals tend to go for about $ 2 - $ 5 with longer month-long rentals nearly matching the price of just buying an old copy of the game. 
Of course, the store-bought copy of the PS3 game wouldn't run on the PS4, so it's really your only option. 
You can play PS4 games on your Vita handheld. 
People who own a PlayStation Vita can use it to Remote Play any game running on their PS4. 
In theory this means you could play a PS4 game on a Vita from anywhere in the world, but Remote Play is dependent on having a really good Internet connection. 
In our experience, Remote Play is best for same-room or same-house sessions when the TV is either too far away or in use for something else. 
Remote Play has gotten much better over the last year, especially when game developers go out of their way to come up with solid adapted control schemes for the Vita. 
The PS4 lets you hand the controller to a friend in another zip code. 
The PS4 also supports a new feature called Share Play, which allows any paying PlayStation Plus subscriber to host a session of most PS4 games that they own, enabling a second, remote PS4 user to spectate the host's game through their console and on their TV. 
The host player can virtually hand control of the game to the guest player, enabling the recipient to play PS4 games that they don't have, remotely, via their friend's PS4. 
Sony sells this idea, in part, as a way for one player to help another through a tough spot in a game. 
There might be too much lag for that to work for twitch-based games, but the service otherwise works pretty well. 
Share Play sessions are limited to an hour, but the clock can be re-started at any time. 
You 'll need a decent Internet connection and a PlayStation Plus subscription for it. 
The Xbox One lets you suspend your games. 
The Xbox One doesn't have a Remote Play option nor a Share Play mode no reason why they couldn't eventually get the latter, but it does have an excellent game suspend mode. 
Console gamers have been accustomed to having to load a video game before they start it, but the Xbox One can actually suspend a game, let you power the console off into a low-power mode and then, when you turn the machine back on, let you pick up the game right where you left it -- no loading. 
It can only do this for one game at a time, but it basically removes the need to boot up the game you 've been most avidly playing. 
Turn on the console and the game is waiting for you to continue playing, exactly where you left off. 
Sony indicated back in early 2013 that it was going to offer a similar option, but they 've yet to deliver. 
The Xbox One can show two things at once. 
The Xbox One has a semi-useful thing called Snap. 
Basically, it's a split-screen option that will run certain applications in a vertical band on the right side of your TV screen while running a game or other application on the left. 
The console does this thanks to its unusual system architecture that has different operating systems handling what's on the different portions of your TV. 
The problem is that Microsoft hasn't found many good uses for Snap. 
You can snap a list of the Achievements for the game you're playing, which is cool if you want to track your progress in achieving them in real-time. 
You can Snap a TV signal from your cable box, if your cable box is plugged into your Xbox One. 
You can keep a list of your Xbox Live friends snapped, watch a Twitch Stream snapped, and so on. 
A lot of that may sound cool, but most of it is stuff you might as well do with a second screen like your phone, tablet or laptop. 
Xbox One has DLNA support, PS4 does not. 
Sony has taken some hits for still not supporting DLNA in-home media-streaming yet. 
They 've indicated that they will, but at the moment, the Xbox One is the only new-gen console that will let you stream media from other devices in your home. 
The Xbox One can integrate with your cable box. 
One of the biggest differences between the consoles should be that the Xbox One has an HDMI-in. 
That means you can plug a cable box -- or even another console -- into the Xbox One and have its video and audio play through the Microsoft machine. 
The Xbox team initially promoted this option as a way to unify your home entertainment devices, by having everything that would connect to your TV funnel through the Xbox One. 
In theory, your cable TV signal wouldn't just flow through the Xbox One but be improved by it through a feature called the One Guide that would allow you to track what's on TV and what's also available through streaming apps. 
In practice, most of us at Kotaku who initially plugged our cable boxes into our Xbox Ones have since disentangled them. 
The benefits weren't worth any signal lag that we experienced. 
In the long term, we suspect that the biggest differences between the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 will be the games. 
Currently, there are a handful of notable exclusives that are on one console and not its rival. 
Sony has more top internal game studios, but Microsoft has a pretty good crew, too: While Microsoft seems to still be interested in grabbing exclusives from third-party publishers see: the next Tomb Raider and Sony is publishing a spiritual sequel to the Dark Souls games in next year's Bloodborne, most of the consoles' exclusive games will come from first-party studios. 
Sony has the advantage here with a network of game studios that include Naughty Dog Uncharted, The Last of Us, Guerilla Games Killzone, Japan Studio Ico, The Puppeteer, Media Molecule LittleBigPlanet, Tearaway, Polyphony Digital Gran Turismo, Sony Santa Monica God of War, Sony San Diego MLB: The Show, London Studio Playroom and more. 
Microsoft's operation is smaller, with its major internal studios consisting of 343 Industries Halo, Lionhead Fable, Rare Kinect Sports, Turn 10 Forza, Black Tusk forthcoming Gears of War, and, technically, Mojang Minecraft. 
Do you love baseball? 
If you're into baseball games, Sony makes MLB: The Show, the de facto only one that matters. 
The Xbox One has no Major League Baseball games. 
Do you love EA? 
If you like EA games, Microsoft has an exclusive on a paid program called EA Access that provides discounts and early access to some EA games as well as free copies of some older releases. 
We could go on an on. 
Doubtless, many owners of the systems will have a lot that they can add to this, and we encourage them to do so in the comments below. 
But do we really not have a preference? 
If you asked any of us on the staff to pick between an Xbox One and a PS4, would we really not be able to make a choice? 
A year ago, and even just six months ago, a lot of us leaned heavily toward the PS4. 
The system had some special features, but we liked it primarily for the one thing we wanted it to do -- play games -- really well. 
The Xbox One was a more confusing machine that seemed weighed down by a bunch of design decisions tied to using the machine as an enhancer to a cable TV box and yet shipped without some basic gamer-friendly features like a controller battery-power indicator or even a way to tell how much hard drive space you had left available both issues have since been fixed. 
Microsoft, however, started closing the gap with a series of system software updates that made some of its odder features, such as Snap, work better. 
It turns out that the Xbox One is a perfectly good modern gaming console, a fact underlined by some strong fall Xbox-only games amid a surprisingly weak late-2014 PS4-only gaming line-up. 
As a result, we feel pretty good about both consoles these days. 
You kind of can't go wrong. 
Aside from the temporary holiday discount for the Xbox One, the two machines basically cost the same amount of money. 
They largely run the same games. 
If you're a huge Halo fan, then of course, get the Xbox One. 
If you're a baseball person, the PS4 is the no-brainer. 
But the vast majority of new-gen games run on both consoles. 
Perhaps the deciding factor will ultimately be wherever your friends are. 
Both consoles are machines geared toward social interaction. 
They're full of activity feeds and support for chat and messaging. 
They're designed to make you feel close to and competitive with the friends you have who also are in the same Xbox Live or PlayStation Network universe. 
So maybe, after reading all of this and weighing the pros and cons you just ask your friends. 
Which one do they have? 
Go get that one. 
Or decide to get the one you want and then convince them to come along and do the same. 
Well, free of Google ads at least. 
As it true with the company's current publishing revenue model AdSense, part of your contribution will go to the creators of all those lovely words, phrases, and sentences you're reading, and of course, Google will also take its cut. 
But your typical Google ad is instead replaced by a pixelated box that simply says thank you for being a Contributor. 
All payment information is handled through your Google account. 
Of course, you can still turn on AdBlock and basically have the same ad-free experience. 
So why bother? 
Well, people still buy music when they can also get it for free I have a premium Spotify account. 
I will admit it, so it's interesting to see Google experimenting in ways to help readers support the websites they frequent the most, if they're so inclined. 
According to Gigaom, the service is launching with ten partners, including Imgur, WikiHow, Science Daily, Urban Dictionary, The Onion, and its biggest partner, Mashable. 
Google is reportedly starting small to see how the new service takes hold. 
This isn't the first instance of companies trying to figure out an alternative way to make money on the currently free content on the web aside from ads. 
This news is another step in Google's quests to find alternative ways to monetize and deliver certain stories to users, and in turn, becoming a major player in digital content distribution. 
So is this the long sought after web model or will we all continue just ignoring ads as usual?

Hey, you want to come camping with Bear? 
That's a pretty random email to get on a Thursday morning, and it contained no other details. 
So, I said yes, packed a bag and hopped on a plane to New Mexico. 
Here's what happened over the next few days. 
I really do mean no details. 
I had a rough idea of where we were going -- the Gila National Forest, a 2.7 million acre region -- and was told not to worry about a tent, sleeping bag or pad. 
The rest was, You 'll be doing his typical stuff. 
A bit intimidating, right? 
This is the guy we 've all spent the last eight years or so watching jump off waterfalls, eat snakes and drink his own urine. 
So I went a bit overboard with my preparation, but more on that in another article. 
The reason this was happening was that a 22-year old girl named Alex above had won the Land Rover Discovery Adventure Challenge in Geneva. 
Her prize? 
A trip with that brand's ambassador, Bear Grylls. 
They flew her over from China, where she's studying, to do it and at the last minute figured they should invite a couple journalists along as well. 
Me and Mark Harris from London's Sunday Times. 
They didn't know any more than I did. 
We just drove way out into the forest to a spot where Bear was flying in by helicopter. 
He hopped off, we hopped into a couple Land Rovers and crashed through rivers out into this incredibly gorgeous little canyon, a location that needs to remain secret because it's where Geronimo was born. 
Bear was definitely in on-camera mode, all enthusiasm and instruction and eat this and cllimb that. 
He and his team were basically turning the canyon into an outdoor playground, taking advantage of its river and cliffs to create obstacles for us to play around on. 
It was like being in an episode of Man vs Wild, just without the quick edits. 
Behind the fourth wall, Bear's shows are necessarily a lot less devil-may-care than they look. 
With insurance and liability and the need to meet a production schedule without delays for injury, every move has to be carefully planned by a small team of experienced experts. 
In addition to moving the on-screen talent around, that team has to look after a small army of cameramen and producers crossing the same challenging terrain that you see on-screen. 
Honestly, the skill and professionalism that helps all that go off without a hitch is more impressive than Bear's on-screen shenanigans. 
Anyone can climb a mountain, very few people could move an entire film crew up one in complete safety. 
So it wasn't the most personally challenging trip, but it was a fun one. 
I think Bear felt the same because, as it became evident that we were all on the same page, the on-camera action hero stuff started to fade behind his actual human personality. 
Bear likes to talk about his family, their home in Wales and his favorite new hobby -- parasailing. 
That's all told through a constant stream of running jokes with his team, a close knit group of friends that have spent the last eight years traveling the world together almost constantly. 
Impressively, it's all upbeat, positive and very little of it is about him. 
Off camera, Bear doesn't like to be in the spotlight. 
But, sitting around the campfire, I did convince him to talk about himself a little bit. 
http://indefinitelywild.gizmodo.com/the-best-outdo ... 
Bear Grylls: I wish I had a dollar for every time I 've been offered pee in a bar. 
Listen, pee sucks and I'm not one of those people that does it in my home time. 
But, the truth is that if you're well hydrated, you 've got nothing else and you're in a survival situation, it can help save your life. 
Tastes horrible though, it's salty and warm. 
The worst I had was from a snake skin. 
I'd killed a snake and used it as a water bottle and I'd had it around my neck in the desert so it'd been fermenting in the snake. 
That was bad. 
Eating any of these things, goat testicles or what have you, isn't going to be nice, but you get into that zone, you become focussed and you do what you need to do. 
It's all about one thing: coming home in one piece. 
BG: I was part of this military expedition to Everest and, when I got back, I wrote a book about it. 
Someone at Discovery read that and said, Why don't we do a show where we put you in various situations and you show us how to get out of them? 
I was super skeptical about doing TV. 
I said no three times, part of which was confidence because I didn't really understand that world. 
I know how to climb mountains and do all that, but I wasn't a TV person. 
Eventually my wife Shara said, Why don't you try it out once and, if you don't like it, you can say no then. 
That was smart advice, so we went and shot the pilot for Man vs Wild and it never felt like TV. 
We were shooting rapids and chasing snakes and all that stuff. 
I look back now and understand the world a bit better and know how competitive it is and, now that I 've been through so many episodes, I think I must have been such an idiot to have said no at the start. 
They put that first one on late at night, no marketing, no nothing and it beat all their season premiers of all the other shows they'd done. 
So they commissioned a proper series. 
The running joke at Discovery is that all the other hosts would come in at the end of each season and say how they deserved another. 
Then, I'd come in and say, It's been great, it's been a privilege, I love it, but we're done. 
http://indefinitelywild.gizmodo.com/whats-wrong-wi ... 
BG: I grew up on survival shows and they were always just so ... anoraky. 
So I said, If I do it, I don't want to brand myself as that. 
Yes, I 've had this training, yes I 've done this all my life, but I want to film the mess and the mistakes and I'm not going to do a textbook survival show because it's boring. 
Invariably, you join this market of all these survival shows and everyone's going, Your advice is dangerous! 
Really, textbook survival says stay still, don't take any chances, wait for rescue. 
That's a boring TV show. 
My thing was always, Listen, shoelace, dead squirrel and no other way down this rock face. 
You can do this! 
Yeah, it's reckless, but for me that is what kept it fresh. 
I didn't want to do eight seasons of How To Build A Fire. 
The intention was to make something fun and dynamic and about self rescue, not about whittling. 
BG: It's about being willing to take risks and it's about getting out there and not being scared to make mistakes and to go for things. 
Simple values like the wild rewards commitment. 
You throw yourself wholeheartedly into it and smile when it's raining. 
Early on, I started to get so many letters from unlikely people ; a single mum going, I watch your show, I'm not into survival, but I hold down four jobs and I get it when you say it's about persistence and putting a positive attitude into things during difficult times. 
That for me was a great liberator to realize that the show isn't about me running around, jumping off stuff and flexing muscles, it's about inspiring people. 
That makes me really happy. 
Pretty sure Alex won this round. 
She wants to be a travel writer, so we're going to have her contribute to IndefinitelyWild. 
Now, when I take kids into the woods, I tell them, What we're going to do today is going to be incredibly dangerous. 
And you just see 20 smiles go up. 
But, we're also going to learn to look after each other, who to work together and who to understand and manage that risk. 
That's what it's about, you don't empower kids if you don't expose them to risk. 
You empower them by teaching them how to deal with it.http: / / indefinitelywild.gizmodo.com/boy-scouts-gay ... 
BG: Yes. 
People go, Oh, Baden Powell, he wouldn't recognize Scouts today. 
But, I think he'd be proud of that. 
He used to say that you can never stand still, you always have to keep developing and keep moving forward. 
Scouts should be progressive and should be adapting. 
If you're gay or not it's irrelevant, Scouting values respect. 
BG: Nothing inspires people more than reckless acts of courage. 
Look at all the stories we admire, it's just the truth. 
Without risk, there can be no growth. 
I wouldn't be doing my job and you wouldn't be doing yours unless we'd been prepared to accept that failure is a possibility. 
As a society, we 've become terrified of failure, but you can't grow without risking it. 
People ask me, How do I succeed? 
Whatever it is they do, I say, Go and find 20 ways of messing it up. 
By 21, you 'll be getting there. 
Life is an adventure, go back with cuts, scars and bruises. 
IW: Someone's sitting at home on their couch right now, wanting to do what you do. 
How do they start? 
BG: Just start adventuring. 
You don't need to go to the ends of the earth, you don't need to climb Everest to have a great adventure, it's invariably on our doorstep. 
Whether you're camping out in a city park or going to a climbing wall, you can do these things. 
Once you go outside and start doing these things it makes you feel good, it fills you with pride and confidence. 
You can't buy that in a shop. 
IndefinitelyWild is a new publication about adventure travel in the outdoors, the vehicles and gear that get us there and the people we meet along the way.

Some gadgets of the past were feats of engineering that managed to squeeze countless moving parts into small packages. 
This diagram of the classic Nikon F3 shared by Bellamy Hunt of Japan Camera Hunter is a glorious sea of mechanics. 
On his website, Hunt details how he came to be in possession of the poster, which looks to be a reference for repairing or servicing the camera, and how he fell head over heels for vintage film cameras in general. 
Looking at the spread truly makes you appreciate the intricacy of such complex devices. 
The particular model in the posted is the Nikon F3-P, which came out in 1983 and was geared toward press photographers. 
I wouldn't hesitate to hang this poster on my wall. 
Check out the great site Japan Camera Hunter for more of Hunt's wheelings and dealings with all kinds of classic cameras. 
This week the Apple Watch made a big step towards reality, with the release of WatchKit for developers of watch apps. 
Hidden within a fairly mundane document are plenty of glimpses at how Apple envisions smartwatches fitting in with our lives. 
With WatchKit come Apple's Watch Human Interface Guidelines, which lay out the company's recommendations for nearly every detail of app design, from color to logos to gestures. 
Here are a few telling points. 
The WatchKit guidelines, even though they're developer-specific, contain loads of general info about how Apple hopes consumers will live with the watch. 
Perhaps the smartest takeaway is the company's insistence that users shouldn't be glued to their watches. 
A Watch app complements your iOS app ; it does not replace it, it says. 
If you measure interactions with your iOS app in minutes, you can expect interactions with your Watch app to be measured in seconds. 
It's nice to know that developers are getting guidance as to what they can reasonably expect from their users. 
Throughout the guidelines, the message is simple: Less is more. 
The digital crown is one of the most interesting aspects of the slew of new UI elements encased in the Apple Watch. 
When the device was announced, the repurposed crown was presented as a way to zoom in and out of the home screen, and scroll through pages. 
Now we're getting more of a sense of why that 'll be so useful. 
Designed for finely tuned, accelerated scrolling -- without obstructing the Apple Watch display -- the Digital Crown makes it easy to scroll through longer pages, Apple says. 
In other words, the crown solves a solution to one big problem with smartwatches: How to scroll through long pages without your finger getting in the way. 
You 've probably already heard about San Francisco, the brand-new typeface that Apple designed specifically for the watch. 
But the UI guidelines give us more information about why it's suited for small screens. 
Unlike some fonts, San Francisco will condense or expand based on the size of the letters. 
If you're reading tiny text, for example, the kerning will expand so there's more space between each letter -- as will the size of the punctuation and the size of the holes in letters like e and a. 
This will make it much less difficult to read the watch's tiny text. 
While your iPhone's notification center is sometimes less than ideal for handling short blips of info, an interaction called Glances is a solution to a problem that iOS has struggled to solve. 
You can think of a glance as a Google Now card: A short blip of information that comes from an app, but that is timely and contextually relevant, presumably based on situational input like location. 
Importantly, you 'll decide when you see those glances. 
Unlike an alert pushed to a device, Glances are accessed at the wearer's discretion, says Apple. 
We already knew that the watch's Retina screen would be able to interpret the force of your finger. 
But now we're getting a glimpse of how that sensitivity will impact the UI. 
A small screen can only accommodate so many controls, Apple writes. 
Force Touch interactions display the context menu if any associated with the current screen. 
Apps use this menu to display actions relevant to the current content. 
That's why Force will act like a secondary layer of interactions. 
You 'll use it to access a higher level menu that displays options within each app. 
One thing that isn't mentioned in the guidelines? 
The Taptic Engine, which will supply the vibrating notifications from apps. 
Back in September, Apple intriguingly said that the engine will supply a range of vibrations customized to each app, so you feel a tactile sensation that's recognizably different for each kind of interaction. 
Presumably, Apple will be controlling those sensations, and it 'll be interesting to find out more about them. 
This could be one of the more interesting ways we interact with the watch, but we 'll have to wait to find out just how big a role the tactile aspects of the UI will play. 
Nikola Tesla is celebrated as a genius who had an amazing ability to envision the future. 
He predicted cellphones, television, and even elements of the internet long before any of these things existed. 
But he also had some weird ideas about the social issues of tomorrow. 
Which is why he's become an unlikely hero in the so-called Men's Rights community of today. 
Despite his brilliance with all things technological, Tesla's views on the social structure of the future were sometimes rather unfortunate. 
He advocated for the principles of eugenics and forced sterilization to ensure that only humans with the most desirable traits could reproduce. 
And he insisted that men would one day be forced to submit to women. 
The inventor imagined a society structured like that of the bee -- where male grunts do the heavy lifting and are otherwise only used for breeding purposes. 
Men would be killed off when they were not needed. 
Tesla spelled out his ideas about the inevitable and in his opinion, unfortunate rise of women in an interview that appeared in the August 10, 1924 issue of the Galveston Daily News. 
Tesla explained that he once adored and worshipped women. 
But that his perspective had recently changed, as women had become more and more like men, striving to compete with men in so many aspects of society. 
Now the soft-voiced gentle woman of my reverent worship has all but vanished, Tesla told a reporter in 1924. 
In her place has come the woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies in making herself as much as possible like man -- in dress, voice and actions, in sports and achievements of every kind. 
Tesla would go on to explain that women competing with men was one of the greatest tragedies he saw in the world. 
And that no good would come of it for civilization as a whole. 
The world has experienced many tragedies, but to my mind the greatest tragedy of all is the present economic condition wherein women strive against men, and in many cases actually succeed in usurping their places in the professions and in industry, the inventor explained in cringe-worthy detail. 
This growing tendency of women to overshadow the masculine is a sign of a deteriorating civilization. 
Perhaps the male in human society is useless. 
I am frank to admit that I don't know, Tesla conceded. 
If women are beginning to feel this way about it -- and there is striking evidence at hand that they do -- then we are entering upon the cruelest period of the world's history. 
With women gaining the vote in all 50 states just four years earlier, Tesla's words no doubt resonated with some men who felt threatened by women's slowly changing role in modern America. 
No less than a matriarchal empire was on the horizon, he warned. 
Our civilization will sink to a state like that which is found among the bees, ants and other insects -- a state wherein the male is ruthlessly killed off, Tesla said. 
In this matriarchal empire which will be established the female rules. 
As the female predominates, the males are at her mercy. 
The male is considered important only as a factor in the general scheme of the continuity of life. 
I am considering this question not merely from the standpoint of a man, Tesla insisted in his 1924 interview. 
I am thinking of the woman's side of it. 
As we contemplate any change, we naturally take into consideration the results that may follow such an innovation. 
One of the results to my mind is quite a pathetic one, Tesla said. 
But women weren't really going to be succeeding in this new world order, Tesla said. 
No, the fairer sex would really be the victims of their own success, sounding like a conservative pundit on some cable news show. 
Woman, herself, is really the victim instead of, as she thinks, the victor. 
Contentment is absent from her life. 
She is ambitious, often far beyond her natural equipment, to attain the thing she wants. 
She too frequently forgets that all women can not be prima donnas and motion picture stars, Tesla opined. 
Woman's discontent makes the life of the present day still more overstressed. 
The high pitch given to existence by people who are restless and dissatisfied because they fail to achieve things wholly out of proportion to the health and talent with which Nature has endowed them is a bad thing for the world, Tesla said, subtly evoking the language of eugenics that would pop up again in his interviews during the 1930s. 
It seems to me that women are not particularly happy in this newly found freedom, in this new competition which they are waging so persistently against men in business and the professions and even in sport, Tesla said. 
The question that naturally arises is, whether the women themselves are the gainers or the losers. 
Tesla would explain in later interviews that perhaps the civilization of the bee was a model society from which humans could learn a thing or two. 
Maybe the scientifically ordered civilization was indeed the way to go, even if that meant an oppressive matriarchy was upon us. 
Tesla had a complicated relationship with women throughout his life. 
One of his best friends was a woman and he absolutely adored his mother. 
But his beliefs were seemingly rooted in a very old fashioned notion about what women's role in the world should be. 
History has given us many examples of the wonderful influence exerted by unusual women. 
Among these have been the mothers of great men, Tesla said to the reporter in 1924, perhaps referring to his own mother in a rather immodest way. 
But their influence lay not in their determination to outdo man, or even to compete with him. 
By nearly all accounts Tesla was not attracted to women, and he could be rather unkind to some, once firing one of his secretaries for being too fat. 
He would sometimes remark on women's clothing when it displeased him. 
Tesla was a brilliant inventor, but sometimes his vision of the world's trajectory took him into strange places. 
And unfortunately, he's now being celebrated by some of the scummiest elements of society -- people who believe here in the 21st century that men are somehow being oppressed by women. 
It's an element to Nikola Tesla's life that many supporters would no doubt like to ignore. 
But like every other genius of history, Tesla was imperfect. 
It's just too bad he's becoming a hero to so many young men on the internet for all the wrong reasons. 
Director, comedian, and EGOT-winning badass Mike Nichols died yesterday. 
Nichols got his start in comedy, first as an improviser and then as part of a duo with the equally legendary Elaine May. 
Even though he was funny as shit he decided he wanted to get into serious filmmaking and theatre, and directed a string of critically lauded films and plays over the course of decades. 
The Graduate is probably his best-known film, but he also helmed Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? 
, Primary Colors, The Birdcage, the HBO miniseries Angels in America, Working Girl, and Charlie Wilson's War. 
Nichols' personal life was as eventful as his career. 
He escaped Nazi Germany at age 9 to come to the U.S., and is a distant relative of Albert Einstein. 
Married four times, he wooed Diane Sawyer, fathered children, and thought horses were majestic. 
The Graduate is a knockout study in ambivalence, the depressed edges of suburbia, and the folly of romanticism. 
It has the most perfect ending to any movie. 
Watch it some time soon to celebrate the great man who directed it.

Former Senator Jim Webb announced that he's forming an exploratory committee yesterday, the first step on a long road to probably running for president. 
He did so in a video that looks like it was filmed in my high school TV studio. 
Under New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's chairmanship, the RGA spent $ 130 million and achieved remarkable success at the polls: All but two Republican governors running for re-election won. 
And the GOP even won governors' races in deep blue states like Illinois, Massachusetts and Maryland. 
Their message? 
Republican governors are putting conservative principles into practice in their states, and they won't allow their party to be defined by what they call the dysfunction in Washington. 
In this case, it was President Obama's executive action on immigration. 
At news conferences, and at a Wednesday afternoon panel moderated by NBC's Chuck Todd, governors were pressed for their views on Obama's action, on immigration, and on how they would handle the millions of undocumented immigrants currently here. 
Louisiana's Bobby Jindal and Wisconsin's Scott Walker bristled at Todd's repeated questions on immigration. 
Scott's tried. 
I 've tried, Jindal said. 
I'd like to talk about energy. 
I'd like to talk about education. 
Walker maintains that while immigration may be important, it was not an issue that came up in his campaign or in many other states. 
Walker said of immigration, If you went out on the campaign trail with us, none of us heard this issue in our races. 
And I dare say it probably wasn't one of the top issues in most United States Senate or House races out there. 
If immigration didn't rank as a top issue in most governors' races, it does with a group that's growing in importance in the U.S. -- Hispanics. 
A recent Gallup poll shows immigration ranks as the second most important issue among Hispanics after the economy. 
At the conference in Boca Raton this week, Ohio Gov. John Kasich said, It's a cool time to be a Republican. 
I think young people are back looking at us again. 
We lost them for a while, but I think they're back. 
In my state, we're seeing minorities now voting Republican. 
President Obama announced Thursday that he's using executive actions to grant temporary relief to some of the nearly 12 million immigrants living in the United States illegally. 
There's been debate over how much latitude the president has to act on immigration, but the Obama said he felt compelled to act after Congress failed to pass a reform bill. 
Even before the prime-time speech, congressional leaders were fired up about the president's plan. 
The first thing we need to explain to the American people is that this is illegal, Rep. Raul Labrador, Republican of Idaho, told NPR's All Things Considered. 
Uber generates lots of revenue. 
Everyone knows it. 
The company's roughly 20 percent cut of ride spend on its platform adds up to big numbers. 
How big, of course, is the real question. 
New data published by Business Insider helps put Uber's revenue into perspective. 
However, before we get to the new sums, let's rewind. 
Here's TechCrunch in December of 2013, reporting on leaked Uber revenue figures from October of that year, emphasis is mine: 
The numbers span a period of between mid-October and mid-November of 2013 and allow us to form a picture, though incomplete, of Uber's income and user statistics over the period. 
According to our calculations based on the information laid out in the dashboard screenshots -- and assuming some similarity in numbers for the rest of the year -- the car service should be pulling in over $ 1B a year in gross bookings. 
At a rough 20% cut, a figure Valleywag notes Kalanick has alluded to, that would place Uber's slice of the revenue around $ 213M a year. 
So, Uber at the time was doing rides at about a $ 1 billion run rate, and bringing in a more than $ 200 million yearly cut. 
Damn fine numbers, really. 
Cut to today, when Business Insider published data from Uber's December of 2013, just one month after the period the figures above were taken from. 
It was a big period for the firm, with New Year's Eve revenue spiking year-over-year, and lots of markets doing high volumes of rides. 
Revenue isn't revenue isn't revenue, however. 
Just ask Tesla. 
Here's the story's first paragraph: 
That is a huge number, certainly. 
But which revenue number is it, $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion, or $ 10 billion? 
Well, none of the above, I don't think. 
Keep in mind the data from October that TechCrunch covered: If Uber was on tip to make just over $ 200 million in revenue for itself on a yearly basis in October of 2013, how by December of the same year was it prepped to generate company-facing top line of $ 1.5 billion, let alone $ 2 billion, or $ 10 billion? 
You pay Uber for your rides. 
It then takes a cut of that total spend, and that's its take-home revenue. 
You can try and count the total spend on its platform as its revenue, but that's as silly as Groupon trying to claim the full sale-price of coupons as its own top line. 
Ask Andrew Mason how well that went. 
So Uber's 20 percent is its revenue, and on a run-rate basis, that figure was nowhere near the billion dollar mark mere months before it supposedly was. 
I think that we are seeing a conflation of the term ` revenue' here. 
If you repine for a moment, and scroll back to the initially leaked Uber slides, what was labeled as revenue was in fact considered to be total platform spend. 
To refresh you: 
That $ 20 million or so per week is around $ 1 billion per year, given the number of weeks per annum. 
That's how we treated what Uber called revenue in the past. 
Now, we appear to be willing to take what Uber called revenue mere months after the above, and presume that it means actual income for the company, and not total platform spend. 
Unless Uber saw a growth spurt so fucking strong between those two months that it grew several-fold, we're misinterpreting revenue. 
So, that means that Uber's prior $ 20 million plus weekly revenue run rate wasn't platform spend, but was instead it's cut, and thus Uber was rocking a $ 5 billion platform spend run rate last October. 
Well that or we're just getting this confused today. 
Uber's growth of 20 or 30 percent from October to a perhaps more busy December isn't outside the realm of the reasonable. 
But here's Business Insider on the December data: 
This implies that the company's San Francisco revenue that month was roughly commensurate with its total forward revenue, calculated from October of that year. 
Or: That Uber's ` revenue' in its slides concerning October was in fact total platform spend, and thus that Uber will likely collect around $ 40 million in revenue from the San Francisco market this year, extrapolating on a forward twelve-month run-rate basis from the new figures. 
So, Uber will see well north of $ 1 billion in total platform spend this year. 
Perhaps even $ 2 billion, or $ 3 billion if things go well. 
That would put its own revenue in the mid hundreds of millions. 
But keep in mind that Twitter is going to generate around $ 1.4 billion in revenue this year, and is worth $ 25.3 billion. 
If Uber was set to spank Twitter's top line, why would it be worth less? 
Oh, and if you count total platform spend as Uber's revenue, it's going to have shit GAAP margins. 
Something to think about. 
Dyson is spending big on new products and product categories, the company announced today. 
The maker of vacuums, fans, heaters, hand dryers, robots and more announced today that it would be spending a total of $ 2.35 billion across a UK tech campus, expansion of its manufacturing efforts, investment in British universities to foster talent, and $ 1.56 billion in new specific tech development projects. 
The British company wants to roll out no fewer than 100 new products, across four new tech portfolios over just the next four years -- we 've already seen it introduce the 360 Eye robot vacuum cleaner this year, as well as announce its entry into the humidifier market, with a device that simultaneously filters bacteria out of the air while it works. 
In past interviews, founder and CEO James Dyson has hinted that the company might be interested in applying the work it has done in battery tech to other areas, too, and continuing to advance the field of domestic robotics. 
Dyson says it folds a full one-third of its total profits back into R&D, and notes that 2,000 of its roughly 4,500 employees worldwide are engineers, and 1,000 of those have come on board in the last four years alone. 
Its partnerships with academic institutions also help it funnel new talent into the company, as well as work out outside research projects. 
With this investment, Dyson is signalling a shift that could mean we no longer see it primarily as a vacuum company in four years' time. 
Could it instead become synonymous with domestic robotics? 
Early yet to tell, since the Dyson 360 Eye has yet to even go on sale, but should arrive this coming spring beginning in Japan. 
This radar image of Tokyo was acquired by the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1A satellite earlier this year. 
The data is so accurate that it can monitor ground movements down to a few millimetres -- which helps urban planners know where they can and can't build.

If you 've seen Interstellar, then you know that the best characters are the wise-cracking robots. 
Unassumingly boxy and faceless, they somehow end up stealing the show. 
Wired has a fascinating behind-the-scenes look on bringing the robots to life -- largely without the help of CGI. 
Minor spoilers ahead. 
Interstellar's F/X coordinator, Scott Fischer, reveals that 80 percent of the robot footage in the movie was real. 
The few exceptions are the action sequences, such as when the robot CASE reveals itself not to be not just a clumsy rectangle, transforming into a nimble jack that tumbles through the water. 
The team built a total of eight robots for the shoot. 
The robot TARS, one of the film's main AI characters, weighed 200 pounds and cost $ 20,000. 
For Bill Irwin, the voice behind the robot TARS, playing a robot was no piece of cake either. 
Wired explains: 
He also operated the hydraulics that controlled the heavy machines. 
Irwin is a few inches taller than TARS, which meant erasing his forehead in postproduction. 
During filming in Iceland, Irwin had to work in thigh-deep water, and the robots' metal corroded so badly that two models had to be disassembled and rebuilt. 
Robot actors, man, always rusting on you.

The Amazon Fire TV Stick is the bargain version of Amazon's super-fast voice search-enabled Fire TV. 
The HDMI version certainly sacrifices a lot of things that make Fire TV great, but is that bargain worth it? 
Absolutely. 
First of all, what is Fire TV and how is the Fire TV Stick different? 
Released back in April, Fire TV is Amazon's sleek streaming box. 
It has 2GB of memory and a quad-core processor that make it lightning-fast to search for things you want to watch within mundo Amazon or in other video apps like Netflix or Showtime. 
It includes voice search that -- gasp! 
-- actually works reliably. 
The only downside? 
It costs 100 bucks. 
Enter the Fire TV Stick, Amazon's $ 40 stripped-down answer to the higher-end streaming box. 
Like the Roku Stick or Chromecast, it pops into the HDMI port in the back of your TV and opens your boob tube to a whole new world of streaming content. 
It's just a little bit clunkier than its Fire predecessor. 
The remote loses its matte finish and just feels a little more plasticky. 
The HDMI port comes with a power cable, and an extender if you need it. 
Where specs are concerned, it's basically half of a Fire TV box -- it has 1GB of memory, a dual-core processor, and a cheaper remote that doesn't come with voice search. 
But that's not to say voice search doesn't work with the Fire. 
You can use voice search with the stick, you just need the remote app, which only exists on Android for now, or you 'll need to buy the spendier $ 30 remote that normally comes standard with the Fire TV box. 
Which, once you're spending a total of $ 70, you might as well just bite the bullet and pay $ 30 more for the whole kit and kaboodle and two more cores worth of oomph. 
In any case, if you're not used to Amazon's excellent voice search, you won't miss it. 
If you are, you will. 
I did! 
Fire TV is my default streaming box. 
I love it for the things I 've mentioned above, and even though in my house, I have a few options from which to stream stuff Roku Stick, Roku 3, Xbox, and the horror show that is a default Samsung Smart TV interface, I always, always default to Fire TV. 
Besides what I 've already discussed in terms of speed and search, Fire TV just offers up a really nice interface. 
Nice how? 
Nice to look at, nice to navigate, and simple to understand. 
On the left-hand side you have your categories apps, Prime video, music, photos, etc., and when you select one, you can search within that section. 
You have your pick of apps, which includes almost everything you could want Netflix, Spotify, Showtime, YouTube, Vimeo, and so forth, except for HBO Go. 
And apparently that one's coming -- eventually. 
But the best reason to go with a Fire TV is if you want movies and shows from Amazon. 
Because Amazon Amazon Amazon. 
No, really, that's what we always argue about the Bezos Universe. 
It has content on its side. 
And Fire TV banks on that in a beautiful way. 
The system is connected with your Amazon account, so even if something isn't included on Prime Instant Video, you can just click and click and pay to watch Groundhog Day or what-have-you. 
It's comfortable and easy TV-watching. 
You don't have to think! 
That's not a bad thing. 
All of that stays the same with Fire TV Stick. 
It's just in a different package. 
So the question a lot of people have is how does Fire TV Stick stack up to Chromecast? 
They're similar in terms of what they do stream content, what they cost $ 39 and $ 35 respectively, and what they are HDMI sticks. 
Fire TV just does it a little bit better, thanks to a couple of convenience factors, one being a remote. 
Chromecast must rely on your phone, tablet, or computer in order to cast stuff to your television, and that works just fine for some. 
But others? 
Others just want a dang remote. 
That's what we 've become used to since we started using TVs. 
Where's the clicker? 
Every dad asks in living rooms around the world on Sunday afternoons. 
We want it. 
We need it. 
It reassures us. 
Seriously, though: folks at Roku made the same argument in favor of a remote to me back when they trotted out the Roku Stick for the first time. 
It's just nice to have the option. 
Also, Chromecast just does not compute to some people. 
Think of your mom. 
Could she figure it out easily? 
Maybe. 
But what about your Aunt or your cousin or some luddite friend. 
Maybe not. 
The other point of comparison is the aforementioned Roku Stick. 
It's $ 50 and offers a lot of the same as Amazon. 
Where it excels is search. 
Search on Roku is universal. 
You can look up Bill Murray, and it will bring up a short bio and everything in his repertoire you could watch and all your possible options of where to watch them on Roku, be it HBO Go, Vudu, Amazon, or wherever. 
It's great! 
But Amazon only lets you search Amazon titles, even if you'd really rather watch something on Netflix. 
The only downside of the Roku Stick is that it's kind of slow. 
And I'd rather have speed and be stuck within Amazon's walled garden than be stuck in buffering purgatory. 
Also, call me shallow, but Fire TV Stick is just better looking than its HDMI cronies. 
Roku is a big purple stick. 
Chromecast has a big butt and a Chrome logo tacked on. 
Fire TV stick is a subtle black HDMI stick. 
It blends in nicely. 
The other thing we need to talk about with regards to the Fire TV Stick is gameplay. 
Yes, like the Fire TV, the Fire TV Stick plays games. 
And if you're a casual gamer, ok sure, you might enjoy toying around with a few of the free games Fire TV has to offer. 
But if you're a serious gamer, you almost certainly have a console in your home. 
In other words, you're not buying Fire TV as a console. 
You're buying it as a streaming system that happens to offer gameplay. 
And if you get a little more serious, you can buy the Amazon-branded gamepad. 
But I'm not so sure you will, because then you'd be the Stick only has about half the games Fire TV has. 
No Asphalt 8: Airborne and no Dead Trigger 2. 
And the games that are there run a little slower. 
The dual-core processor doesn't have the oomph. 
All told, the Fire TV stick is worth it. 
Essentially, all you're giving up is speed. 
Think of it this way: with Fire TV, you don't think of speed because it's so fast, you don't have time to think of it. 
With the Stick, you have noticeable seconds of load time -- time enough for you to think about that little wheel up on your screen spinning. 
With the box, when you select something, say, a TV show, there's no wait. 
It's on your screen almost immediately. 
With Fire TV Stick, you 'll have to be patient, but only for a second or two. 
Flipping through the UI is also little bit laggier on the Stick. 
You notice it in the sense, once again, that it hangs the tiniest bit, whereas the box hangs not at all. 
So to reiterate, slower, yes. 
But not Roku Stick slow. 
At this price, a little bit of wait isn't unreasonable. 
If you're looking to cut the cord from your cable provider, you 'll need at least a good streaming box, and an OTA antenna.

Apple released an update to iOS 8 earlier this week that promised performance increases on older devices like the iPhone 4S, iPad 2, iPad Mini, and iPod Touch. 
Ars Technica took a look at the numbers and found some disappointing results. 
If you're using an older device, iOS 8 really slowed things down. 
The interface was laggy and app load times were dismal. 
Turns out things aren't that much better with 8.1.1. 
In Ars Technica's tests, they found that app load times were about the same, the interface was still sluggish, and web site load times were only marginally increased. 
Which is to say, if you're still rocking iOS 7 on an older device, it's probably best to stay there. 
Head over to Ars Technica for the full results. 
What's the sound of a spacecraft landing? 
It used to be a source of fun speculation, but now we know for sure. 
Instruments recorded the thump of Philae's first of three landings on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko last week. 
The SESAME-CASSE instrument, which includes sensors on the bottom of the lander's feet, recorded vibrations felt when Philae first bounced off the comet's surface. 
What you hear is the actual sound of the landing. 
Sounds can't travel through the vacuum of space, because there are no air molecules to vibrate. 
But sound can move through solid objects like the leg of a spacecraft, which is what Philae recorded. 
The sounds reveal that the lander first touched down on a hard, icy surface covered by a softer layer several centimeters thick that is probably dust. 
As for where Philae is now, the team is still figuring it out. 
Preliminary data suggests that the little spacecraft is sitting on a lot of water ice.

Besides what I 've already discussed in terms of speed and search, Fire TV just offers up a really nice interface. 
Nice how? 
Nice to look at, nice to navigate, and simple to understand. 
On the left-hand side you have your categories apps, Prime video, music, photos, etc., and when you select one, you can search within that section. 
You have your pick of apps, which includes almost everything you could want Netflix, Spotify, Showtime, YouTube, Vimeo, and so forth, except for HBO Go. 
And apparently that one's coming -- eventually. 
But the best reason to go with a Fire TV is if you want movies and shows from Amazon. 
Because Amazon Amazon Amazon. 
No, really, that's what we always argue about the Bezos Universe. 
It has content on its side. 
And Fire TV banks on that in a beautiful way. 
The system is connected with your Amazon account, so even if something isn't included on Prime Instant Video, you can just click and click and pay to watch Groundhog Day or what-have-you. 
It's comfortable and easy TV-watching. 
You don't have to think! 
That's not a bad thing. 
All of that stays the same with Fire TV Stick. 
It's just in a different package. 
So the question a lot of people have is how does Fire TV Stick stack up to Chromecast? 
They're similar in terms of what they do stream content, what they cost $ 39 and $ 35 respectively, and what they are HDMI sticks. 
Fire TV just does it a little bit better, thanks to a couple of convenience factors, one being a remote. 
Chromecast must rely on your phone, tablet, or computer in order to cast stuff to your television, and that works just fine for some. 
But others? 
Others just want a dang remote. 
That's what we 've become used to since we started using TVs. 
Where's the clicker? 
Every dad asks in living rooms around the world on Sunday afternoons. 
We want it. 
We need it. 
It reassures us. 
Seriously, though: folks at Roku made the same argument in favor of a remote to me back when they trotted out the Roku Stick for the first time. 
It's just nice to have the option. 
Also, Chromecast just does not compute to some people. 
Think of your mom. 
Could she figure it out easily? 
Maybe. 
But what about your Aunt or your cousin or some luddite friend. 
Maybe not. 
The other point of comparison is the aforementioned Roku Stick. 
It's $ 50 and offers a lot of the same as Amazon. 
Where it excels is search. 
Search on Roku is universal. 
You can look up Bill Murray, and it will bring up a short bio and everything in his repertoire you could watch and all your possible options of where to watch them on Roku, be it HBO Go, Vudu, Amazon, or wherever. 
It's great! 
But Amazon only lets you search Amazon titles, even if you'd really rather watch something on Netflix. 
The only downside of the Roku Stick is that it's kind of slow. 
And I'd rather have speed and be stuck within Amazon's walled garden than be stuck in buffering purgatory. 
Also, call me shallow, but Fire TV Stick is just better looking than its HDMI cronies. 
Roku is a big purple stick. 
Chromecast has a big butt and a Chrome logo tacked on. 
Fire TV stick is a subtle black HDMI stick. 
It blends in nicely. 
The other thing we need to talk about with regards to the Fire TV Stick is gameplay. 
Yes, like the Fire TV, the Fire TV Stick plays games. 
And if you're a casual gamer, ok sure, you might enjoy toying around with a few of the free games Fire TV has to offer. 
But if you're a serious gamer, you almost certainly have a console in your home. 
In other words, you're not buying Fire TV as a console. 
You're buying it as a streaming system that happens to offer gameplay. 
And if you get a little more serious, you can buy the Amazon-branded gamepad. 
But I'm not so sure you will, because then you'd be the Stick only has about half the games Fire TV has. 
No Asphalt 8: Airborne and no Dead Trigger 2. 
And the games that are there run a little slower. 
The dual-core processor doesn't have the oomph. 
All told, the Fire TV stick is worth it. 
Essentially, all you're giving up is speed. 
Think of it this way: with Fire TV, you don't think of speed because it's so fast, you don't have time to think of it. 
With the Stick, you have noticeable seconds of load time -- time enough for you to think about that little wheel up on your screen spinning. 
With the box, when you select something, say, a TV show, there's no wait. 
It's on your screen almost immediately. 
With Fire TV Stick, you 'll have to be patient, but only for a second or two. 
Flipping through the UI is also little bit laggier on the Stick. 
You notice it in the sense, once again, that it hangs the tiniest bit, whereas the box hangs not at all. 
So to reiterate, slower, yes. 
But not Roku Stick slow. 
At this price, a little bit of wait isn't unreasonable. 
If you're looking to cut the cord from your cable provider, you 'll need at least a good streaming box, and an OTA antenna.

Android/iOS: Google's new Inbox app lets you bundle messages for easy organization. 
It's great, but there's more you can do with those bundles. 
After creating one, you can control how often a bundle appears, like once a day or once a week, or even have it skip the inbox altogether. 
By default, bundles appear as messages arrive, which often causes more clutter than necessary. 
For example: It would be nice to have all your newsletters appear once a day, rather than throughout the day. 
With bundles you can make these types of changes. 
Set your less urgent bundles to show up once a day, once a week, or, if you're avoiding spam, never. 
It's easy: 
Skip the Inbox keeps the messages bundled and makes the entire bundle disappear, so make sure you check it. 
If you don't, the messages will start appearing individually. 
Use these settings to help you put the important messages in the forefront and block out the noise. 
I'm in the market for a new not used car. 
Winter is approaching quickly and I would really like something with all-wheel-drive or 4-wheel-drive. 
I would prefer something on the smaller side with decent gas mileage. 
I have a max budget of $ 20,000 before taxes and fees. 
This is not an easy segment to shop in, but automakers like Honda and Mazda are realizing that folks want affordable AWD compacts. 
However the HR-V and CX-3 won't be available for some time. 
So if you are in need of something small and cheap that can get you through the winter right now, there are a few solid values. 
Before I go any further, I must disclose that having an AWD/4WD vehicle in the winter will not make you invincible because your traction is only as good as your tires. 
Regardless of your driven wheels, I strongly suggest investing in an extra set of wheels and tires that you can swap on when the temperature drops. 
Keep in mind that winter tires are not just meant for the snow and ice, but their rubber compound is designed to grip better on colder surfaces even when dry. 
So know that you are going to get yourself a winter wheel/tire set, your AWD/4WD vechicle should do pretty well. 
Jeeps are rugged, off-road, 4 wheel-drive legends, right? 
Certain vehicles like the Wrangler and Cherokee have that reputation, but with a sub 20k budget your only choices are the Patriot and Compass. 
While you can get either one of these brand new well within your budget, neither car was Jeep's best effort in terms of making an affordable 4WD machine. 
Both of them are due to be replaced by the upcoming Renegade, that should be a great mini off-road runabout. 
However, the Renegade is not due to hit showrooms until sometime early 2015. 
If you fancy yourself a wannabe rally driver you are probably familiar with the legendary Lancer Evolution. 
Of course you could pick up a pre-owned Evo, but my guess is you want something with a warranty that hasn't been hooned to death. 
The good news is Mitsubishi has some affordable options in the way of the Evo's relatives. 
First up is the Lancer SE AWC. 
Many shoppers weren't even aware that the base Lancer sedan was available with a selectable all-wheel-drive system. 
Even though the MSRP is $ 21,805, if you shop carefully you find ones for under $ 18,000. 
Also available is the Lancer's much easier to find crossover cousin the Outlander Sport, that can be easily had for under $ 20k. 
Both Mitsus offer a decent amount of punch and are a solid value for the equipment and long warranty, but their antiquated CVT often ruins the fun. 
The all new Nissan Rogue is a sharp looking car with some great features, it is a huge improvement over the previous generation. 
However, for some reason Nissan is keeping the old Rogue around and calling it the Rogue Select. 
It isn't bad little crossover, it's just not exiting. 
The good news is you can find numerous AWD examples well within your budget. 
Now if you wanted something a little different and fun to toss around, the Nissan Juke with it's torque vectoring AWD system make this hatch/crossover thingy an enjoyable commuter. 
The downside to the Juke's punchy turbo motor is the gas mileage is not great considering it's size. 
When most folks think of the best car brand for winter driving, Subaru immediately comes to mind. 
Subaru's combination of horizontally opposed engines and symmetrical AWD systems make them sturdy and stable when the white stuff covers the roadways. 
While most of Subaru's lineup is above the $ 20,000 threshold, you can pick up a minimally equipped Impreza sedan for just under $ 19,000. 
The Impreza also gets the best gas mileage of the bunch at 34mpg if you can tolerate the CVT, however, if you prefer to row-your-own, a 5 speed manual is available. 
Of course, with any of these selections you want to take a broader look at your car buying needs and not just focus on one thing. 
Also keep in mind that even with a good set of snow tires and all-wheel-drive, sometimes it's best just to stay home. 
Wineskin is a free, open source utility that ports Windows programs to OS X so you can run them natively. 
It's built on Wine, an engine made for developers to help the quickly port software. 
There are a few apps that do this, like previously mentioned WineBottler or commercial software like CrossOver, but we 've had the best luck work with Wineskin. 
Due to the way Wineskin works, you won't be able to play the newest, most graphically intense games or power-hungry software. 
But you can port older software and lightweight games that don't hog a ton of resources like many indie games. 
For more intense programs, you 'll likely want to dual boot Windows with Apple's Boot Camp software instead. 
Software will likely run better with Boot Camp, but Wineskin is great because you can port your favorite program and run it right in OS X -- without ever purchasing Windows or rebooting your computer. 
With that out of the way, let's port some software. 
We 've tested Wineskin with a number of apps, but we 'll use Torchlight II as our sample since the Mac port seems to be dead in the water. 
Before you start, you 'll need to download Wineskin. 
Once you 've got it, go ahead and drag the file to your Applications folder and launch it. 
If you haven't already, download the Windows installer for your program of choice as well in this case, the Torchlight II installer. 
Instead of always updating the program itself, you 'll update two different things in Wineskin: the wrapper and the engine. 
You 'll get to the engine in the next step, but you can update the wrapper version right now by just clicking on the Update button. 
A wrapper is a set of registry files and a fake C: drive. 
You 'll need to make a new wrapper for each application you want to port. 
Next up, it's time to install a Wineskin Engine. 
This is where things get a little weird. 
An engine includes a bunch of settings that can help you run software. 
The newest version is WS9 1.7.29. 
You can download and use older Wineskin engines, and certain engines are more compatible with certain titles than others. 
Just click the + button and choose the engine you want to use for your software port. 
When I first tried to run Torchlight II, I went with the newest version of the Wineskin engine and couldn't get it to work. 
So, I did some digging to figure out why. 
Thankfully, Wine HQ features a huge list of software compatibility. 
After searching for Torchlight II, I found that it only works with WS9 1.7.16. 
So, before you pick your engine, dig around on Wine HQ to see what other people are saying about compatibility. 
The newest version isn't always the best, so pick whichever engine seems to have the most compatibility with the software you want to port. 
Your wrapper is now created. 
Before you can install software, though, you 'll need to mess around with some options. 
Next, it's time to make some tweaks to your wrapper. 
Double-click the file in Finder You might get an error message the first time, just double-click it again if you do and you 'll open up the Wrapper settings. 
You 'll see three options here: Install Software, Set Screen Options, and Advanced. 
Unless you know your software is fully compatible with no additional settings, hold off on installing for now. 
Instead, click Advanced. 
The Advanced setting has a ton of options, and most of them are pretty confusing. 
On your main Configuration tab, you can set up a special Windows EXE file to open, change the app icon, and rename the app if you want. 
The Tools tab has a ton of different options to change up configurations, install special Winetricks to make software more compatible, and rebuild your wrappers. 
WineTricks is a script that installs basic components into your wrapper. 
These are usually Microsoft DLL files and fonts that can fix problems with your ports. 
There are a billion WineTricks to choose from, but you 'll find guides for installing them here. 
The Options tab has more options for your software that include changing how a three button mouse works, how the ALT key works, and more. 
At a glance, all this stuff is pretty overwhelming and hard to really understand. 
Don't worry though. 
You have a couple of options for figuring out which settings you need to alter. 
The first place you should check is Wine HQ. 
If you're trying to install popular software, you 'll usually find a guide for doing so on Wine HQ. 
Take a look at the Team Fortress 2 page as an example. 
Each bit of software you install needs a custom set of Wrapper settings, so prepare to dig into these pages each time you want to make your own port. 
Unfortunately, Torchlight II doesn't have a very good page on Wine HQ. 
So, I turned to Google and found IAM SysAdmin's post on getting it to work. 
Here's the gist of what I had to configure just to give you an idea of what you can expect with this step: 
Obviously, not all software requires this much configuration, but some of it will. 
Unless you're a Windows master who's great at reading error logs, I suggest hunting down working configuration settings before you try to install software. 
You 'll find your ports in your Wineskin folder User > Applications > Wineskin. 
Just double-click your newly created app to run it. 
If everything worked it 'll load up and you can start using it as if it was a Mac app. 
If you installed a game, you might want to pop into the Settings before you start and drop down any graphics settings. 
Since it's a hacked together port of software, things tend to be a bit slow, so you're better off starting with low graphics settings and moving up. 
That's it! 
You can reconfigure any settings or mess around with different options if you need to. 
You 'll likely have mixed luck with porting your software, but it's worth a try and 20 minutes of your time if you want to run Windows software on your Mac desktop, without having to install a virtual machine or partition your drive with Boot Camp.

There's a lack of information about flood risk worldwide, and it leaves people in flood-prone areas unaware of their danger, and less likely to take precautions. 
The image above comes from a study published last month in Geophysical Research Letters that used nighttime satellite imagery to see where waterfronts are in danger. 
Using night lights to show both population density and economic activity, this study combined imagery from NOAA's DMSP F17 satellite with US Geological Survey maps of flood-prone areas world wide. 
According to the research, the amount of light in river areas has increased 1.2 percent globally over the past 20 years. 
Of course, this number is different depending on where you are in the globe. 
Unsurprisingly, these changes are happening fastest in the developing world. 
For example, Sudan has had a night-light increase of 6.4 percent per year over the past 20 years. 
In 2007, record floods in that country killed hundreds of people, destroyed thousands of homes, and caused millions of dollars in damage. 
The data isn't perfect. 
For one, several countries aren't represented in the USGS river database Russia and Canada, most notably. 
Also, human and economic activity don't always give off light. 
Night lights are a product of population growth, economic growth, and access to electricity, said Brenden Jongman, a researcher at the Institute for Environmental Studies at VU University Amsterdam in the Netherlands, who was not part of the study. 
In many places, like Bangladesh or Thailand, access to electricity is missing and therefore night lights aren't a good proxy for the lives and property at stake. 
Nor are all rivers equally likely to flood. 
Serena Ceola, an environmental engineer at the University of Bologna in Italy and lead author of the study said the next step is to incorporate data on climate change, weather patterns, and individual river characteristics. 
In a prime-time speech on Thursday, Obama defied congressional Republicans by announcing a plan that shields up to 5 million immigrants from deportation. 
Via the PBS Newshour, here's video of Obama's 15-minute speech: 
Also, here is the text of the speech as it was prepared for delivery: My fellow Americans, tonight, I'd like to talk with you about immigration. 
For more than 200 years, our tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world has given us a tremendous advantage over other nations. 
It's kept us youthful, dynamic, and entrepreneurial. 
It has shaped our character as a people with limitless possibilities -- people not trapped by our past, but able to remake ourselves as we choose. 
But today, our immigration system is broken, and everybody knows it. 
Families who enter our country the right way and play by the rules watch others flout the rules. 
Business owners who offer their workers good wages and benefits see the competition exploit undocumented immigrants by paying them far less. 
All of us take offense to anyone who reaps the rewards of living in America without taking on the responsibilities of living in America. 
And undocumented immigrants who desperately want to embrace those responsibilities see little option but to remain in the shadows, or risk their families being torn apart. 
It's been this way for decades. 
And for decades, we haven't done much about it. 
When I took office, I committed to fixing this broken immigration system. 
And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders. 
Today, we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history. 
And over the past six years, illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half. 
Although this summer, there was a brief spike in unaccompanied children being apprehended at our border, the number of such children is now actually lower than it's been in nearly two years. 
Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s. 
Those are the facts. 
Meanwhile, I worked with Congress on a comprehensive fix, and last year, 68 Democrats, Republicans, and Independents came together to pass a bipartisan bill in the Senate. 
It wasn't perfect. 
It was a compromise, but it reflected common sense. 
It would have doubled the number of border patrol agents, while giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship if they paid a fine, started paying their taxes, and went to the back of the line. 
And independent experts said that it would help grow our economy and shrink our deficits. 
Had the House of Representatives allowed that kind of a bill a simple yes-or-no vote, it would have passed with support from both parties, and today it would be the law. 
But for a year and a half now, Republican leaders in the House have refused to allow that simple vote. 
Now, I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common sense law. 
But until that happens, there are actions I have the legal authority to take as President -- the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican Presidents before me -- that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just. 
First, we 'll build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel so that they can stem the flow of illegal crossings, and speed the return of those who do cross over. 
Second, I will make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates, and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy, as so many business leaders have proposed. 
Third, we 'll take steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our country. 
I want to say more about this third issue, because it generates the most passion and controversy. 
Even as we are a nation of immigrants, we are also a nation of laws. 
Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that they must be held accountable -- especially those who may be dangerous. 
That's why, over the past six years, deportations of criminals are up 80 percent. 
And that's why we're going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security. 
Felons, not families. 
Criminals, not children. 
Gang members, not a mother who's working hard to provide for her kids. 
We 'll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day. 
But even as we focus on deporting criminals, the fact is, millions of immigrants -- in every state, of every race and nationality -- will still live here illegally. 
And let's be honest -- tracking down, rounding up, and deporting millions of people isn't realistic. 
Anyone who suggests otherwise isn't being straight with you. 
It's also not who we are as Americans. 
After all, most of these immigrants have been here a long time. 
They work hard, often in tough, low-paying jobs. 
They support their families. 
They worship at our churches. 
Many of their kids are American-born or spent most of their lives here, and their hopes, dreams, and patriotism are just like ours. 
As my predecessor, President Bush, once put it: They are a part of American life. 
Now here's the thing: we expect people who live in this country to play by the rules. 
We expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly rewarded. 
So we're going to offer the following deal: If you 've been in America for more than five years ; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents ; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and you're willing to pay your fair share of taxes -- you 'll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily, without fear of deportation. 
You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. 
That's what this deal is. 
Now let's be clear about what it isn't. 
This deal does not apply to anyone who has come to this country recently. 
It does not apply to anyone who might come to America illegally in the future. 
It does not grant citizenship, or the right to stay here permanently, or offer the same benefits that citizens receive -- only Congress can do that. 
All we're saying is we're not going to deport you. 
I know some of the critics of this action call it amnesty. 
Well, it's not. 
Amnesty is the immigration system we have today -- millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules, while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time. 
That's the real amnesty -- leaving this broken system the way it is. 
Mass amnesty would be unfair. 
Mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character. 
What I'm describing is accountability -- a commonsense, middle ground approach: If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. 
If you're a criminal, you 'll be deported. 
If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up. 
The actions I'm taking are not only lawful, they're the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican President and every single Democratic President for the past half century. 
And to those Members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill. 
I want to work with both parties to pass a more permanent legislative solution. 
And the day I sign that bill into law, the actions I take will no longer be necessary. 
Meanwhile, don't let a disagreement over a single issue be a dealbreaker on every issue. 
That's not how our democracy works, and Congress certainly shouldn't shut down our government again just because we disagree on this. 
Americans are tired of gridlock. 
What our country needs from us right now is a common purpose -- a higher purpose. 
Most Americans support the types of reforms I 've talked about tonight. 
But I understand the disagreements held by many of you at home. 
Millions of us, myself included, go back generations in this country, with ancestors who put in the painstaking work to become citizens. 
So we don't like the notion that anyone might get a free pass to American citizenship. 
I know that some worry immigration will change the very fabric of who we are, or take our jobs, or stick it to middle-class families at a time when they already feel like they 've gotten the raw end of the deal for over a decade. 
I hear these concerns. 
But that's not what these steps would do. 
Our history and the facts show that immigrants are a net plus for our economy and our society. 
And I believe it's important that all of us have this debate without impugning each other's character. 
Because for all the back-and-forth of Washington, we have to remember that this debate is about something bigger. 
It's about who we are as a country, and who we want to be for future generations. 
Are we a nation that tolerates the hypocrisy of a system where workers who pick our fruit and make our beds never have a chance to get right with the law? 
Or are we a nation that gives them a chance to make amends, take responsibility, and give their kids a better future? 
Are we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents' arms? 
Or are we a nation that values families, and works to keep them together? 
Are we a nation that educates the world's best and brightest in our universities, only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us? 
Or are we a nation that encourages them to stay and create jobs, businesses, and industries right here in America? 
That's what this debate is all about. 
We need more than politics as usual when it comes to immigration ; we need reasoned, thoughtful, compassionate debate that focuses on our hopes, not our fears. 
I know the politics of this issue are tough. 
But let me tell you why I have come to feel so strongly about it. 
Over the past few years, I have seen the determination of immigrant fathers who worked two or three jobs, without taking a dime from the government, and at risk at any moment of losing it all, just to build a better life for their kids. 
I 've seen the heartbreak and anxiety of children whose mothers might be taken away from them just because they didn't have the right papers. 
I 've seen the courage of students who, except for the circumstances of their birth, are as American as Malia or Sasha ; students who bravely come out as undocumented in hopes they could make a difference in a country they love. 
These people -- our neighbors, our classmates, our friends -- they did not come here in search of a free ride or an easy life. 
They came to work, and study, and serve in our military, and above all, contribute to America's success. 
Tomorrow, I 'll travel to Las Vegas and meet with some of these students, including a young woman named Astrid Silva. 
Astrid was brought to America when she was four years old. 
Her only possessions were a cross, her doll, and the frilly dress she had on. 
When she started school, she didn't speak any English. 
She caught up to the other kids by reading newspapers and watching PBS, and became a good student. 
Her father worked in landscaping. 
Her mother cleaned other people's homes. 
They wouldn't let Astrid apply to a technology magnet school for fear the paperwork would out her as an undocumented immigrant -- so she applied behind their back and got in. 
Still, she mostly lived in the shadows -- until her grandmother, who visited every year from Mexico, passed away, and she couldn't travel to the funeral without risk of being found out and deported. 
It was around that time she decided to begin advocating for herself and others like her, and today, Astrid Silva is a college student working on her third degree. 
Are we a nation that kicks out a striving, hopeful immigrant like Astrid -- or are we a nation that finds a way to welcome her in? 
Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a stranger -- we were strangers once, too. 
My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. 
We were strangers once, too. 
And whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic, or the Pacific, or the Rio Grande, we are here only because this country welcomed them in, and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like, or what our last names are, or how we worship. 
What makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal -- that all of us are created equal, and all of us have the chance to make of our lives what we will. 
That's the country our parents and grandparents and generations before them built for us. 
That's the tradition we must uphold. 
That's the legacy we must leave for those who are yet to come. 
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love.

Here's a sad story: a UK woman brought her husband's ashes to a T-Mobile store after they refused to cancel the dead man's contract. 
That's an extreme case, but indicative of the nightmare some people have to go through to close an account. 
Have you ever had a hard time canceling a contract? 
Tell us about it. 
The woman who had to bring her ashes eventually got to cancel the contract. 
But it took a whole lot -- sending death certificates, making of phone calls, and ultimately going to the store in person with his remains in tow. 
Your plight may not be as dramatic, but if you have a story of carrier canceling horror, tell us about it below. 
Contractual agreements are in the very early stages between the two companies and these things could always fall apart. 
However, if it does happen, we 've been told that some assets will be rolled into Fab founder Jason Goldberg's new furniture design company Hem and the rest will be taken over by PCH. 
Fab was once a Silicon Valley darling. 
The likely purchase price is a paltry one, compared to the $ 150 million it raised at a $ 1 billion valuation just over a year ago. 
Goldberg admitted the company was burning through $ 14 million a month before a massive round of layoffs in June. 
Fab's been on the market for a couple months, from what we 've been hearing. 
However, Goldberg told TechCrunch back in October that, We had an opportunity to sell Fab in the last couple of years, and I said, ` I didn't start it to sell it, I started it to build a great e-commerce business. 
Fab has seen some drastic changes in its 3 years of operation. 
It started out as a dating site for the gay community and then relaunched as a flash sale site for home decor. 
Fab announced just six months after the pivot that it had grown its membership to 2 million, with sales averaging $ 1.5 million a week. 
A source close to the company tells us no one really works at Fab anymore. 
Although one could argue that technically most of what Fab was has been rolled into Goldberg's new venture. 
He's now shifted all focus to Hem and has moved to Berlin to manage everything there. 
Goldberg maintains his CEO title in both Fab and Hem at this time.

Programming in general is a valuable skill when it comes to searching for jobs, but employers will pay more for some of them. 
If you're wondering what you should learn to broaden your horizon, here's a list of the top 12 paying skills right now. 
The digital news site Quartz scoured an exhaustive report from the Brookings Institution containing data on thousands of American job ads, and then filtered out all of the programming skills. 
The salary for each skill listed is an average based on those thousands of job listings. 
Here are the top five: 
It's important to keep in mind that a high salary doesn't necessarily mean that the the position is high demand. 
Additionally, focusing on only one skill can hurt you down the line if a certain language falls dramatically in use or popularity. 
Pick a few of the most sought after skills to become familiar with and, most importantly, learn how to learn. 
If you know how to pick up any programming skill quickly, you 'll be much better off.

Being truly productive is about more than just getting the things you need done each day. 
To be at your most productive you need to use all of your time to the fullest, and in that way you never really have a time when you're free. 
Chris Guillebeau, creator and writer of the blog The Art of Non-Conformity, decided to take on a common request you probably heard at some point: Let's talk when you're free. 
Guillebeau explains that this is a foolish request for productivity-focused individuals: 
Productive people are never free. 
They don't have 15 minutes on their lunch break to have a quick call. 
They don't kill time -- a terrible phrase. 
You can always put a window of time to good use if you work for it. 
Productive people schedule their priorities -- not always their time, but always their priorities. 
When they don't have something to do, they find something to do. 
Time is a precious resource that you only have so much of, so use it wisely. 
Remember, doing the things you want to do -- like spending time with family or friends, reading, playing games, drawing -- is still productive to you even if it's not work. 
Tell yourself that you don't have free time, and schedule your priorities, because there is always something productive that can be done. 
Android: Today, Evernote added the slick business card scanning feature from the iOS version to Android. 
Simply take a picture of a business card and Evernote will parse the data and create a new contact for you. 
The feature is part of Evernote Premium. 
However, if you connect Evernote to LinkedIn, you can use it for free for a year. 
Which you should probably do anyway, since Evernote can pull data it recognizes from LinkedIn to make your notes even more useful. 
If you don't want to connected LinkedIn, Evernote Premium costs $ 5/month or $ 45 per year if you pay up front. 
Have you ever bought something and then noticed in the retailers next flyer that the item is now on sale?

iOS: If you're a web developer, checking out the source code behind a web site is a pretty common task. 
View Source is an iOS app that allows you to do it on any page and includes handy syntax highlighting that makes it easy to find what you need. 
As an app, you can just drop a URL into it and View Source shows you the code behind it. 
More useful is the new Safari extension. 
Just navigate to any page in Safari, tap the extension, and you can view the source right there. 
Obviously you can always get a mobile view by switching your desktop browser's user agent, but this is a handy way to peel back the curtain when you're on the go. 
If you're a cyclist, you need a patch kit. 
It doesn't matter if you're a commuter or a weekend warrior, if you're traveling away from home, you need the tools and skills to fix a flat. 
The Sweethome breaks down the best gear for your kit and shows you how to use it. 
The Sweethome breaks down what you need in your patch kit patches, pump, tire levers, spare tube, multitool, then rates the best and shows you how to use them. 
Even if you're well-versed in what's required in a patch kit, it's still useful to check out their guide and tests for the best tools for the job. 
Chrome: Many web sites are almost blindingly bright, with glaringly white backgrounds that could cause eyestrain. 
Deluminate is an extension that lets you dim or invert the luminance of pages in your browser so they're easier to read. 
The extension has a number of settings as well as keyboard shortcuts to turn Deluminate on or off for any site you're on. 
You can simply dim a page so it's light or medium or dark gray instead of white or invert the luminance, as shown above. 
You can also control how images are treated in the tweak. 
Many areas of the country are getting hit by cold fronts and snow, and many others can expect the same this winter. 
So let's talk snow shoveling technique. 
When shoveling snow manually, you 'll want to be as efficient as possible so you don't hurt yourself and can get back into your warm home as soon as you can. 
Popular Mechanics offers over a dozen rules for shoveling snow, such as stretching first and maintaining the proper posture use your legs, not your back or shoulders. 
Three tips are about strategically moving the snow, in rectangles: 
Do the foreground then the backgroundFor example, to clear snow from a rectangle, first shovel a strip clear along the perimeter of the rectangle. 
Then, moving from the center to the edge, push the snow into the cleared area. 
Next, lift and throw the snow out of the area. 
Perhaps more important, though, is their advice to not move the same snow twice. 
Decide where you're going to move the snow and start by putting the first shovelfuls far from you and then the remaining snow closer and closer to where you are, so in the end your shovel moves shortest distance. 
Every year, our sister publication TechCrunch Japan has its own tech conference called TechCrunch Tokyo to bring together local investors and entrepreneurs and to introduce that crowd to some of the more successful startups from the U.S. and Europe. 
This year, speakers visiting Japan for the event included Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky and Product Hunt founder Ryan Hoover, among others. 
This year, the competition boasted a wide range of startups across a number of different product categories. 
That included everything from education to small business backend tools to food delivery to outsourcing logistics for businesses. 
In many ways, what was most interesting to me was how many of the same businesses and concepts that have launched in the U.S. are also being tackled by Japanese entrepreneurs. 
For instance, it's easy to see the parallels between food delivery startup Bento, which gets 500-yen bento boxes to customers in under 10 minutes, and San Francisco's Sprig or Spoonrocket offerings. 
And Bizer, which provides cloud-based backend management tools for small businesses, reminded me of how Zenefits is providing a simple platform for SMBs to manage HR practices in the U.S. 
While many of the startups were trying to solve problems specifically for Japanese users, there were others that had more global appeal. 
The startup which walked away with the main prize -- more on that later -- had created a product that could be used by developers anywhere in the world. 
Mikan is an app to help users studying English to quickly boost their vocabulary. 
Aiming to boost the number of Japanese citizens who are bilingual to 100 million by 2020, Mikan provides a flash-card like functionality for reviewing groups of words to understand their definition. 
The app separates vocab words into categories of those users know and those they don't, and keeps serving up those they don't until they get them. 
As a result, users are able to learn vocab words more quickly than traditional methods -- up to 1,000 in just one 24-hour period, according to the founder. 
While a number of fashion apps out there are aimed at getting users to discover new fashions, Closet is designed to help fashion-conscious users get more use out of the clothes they already own. 
Users simply take photos of their individual pieces of clothing and then can mix and match them to create new and interesting outfits and share them with others. 
There are already a number of smart locks out there, but Akerun is specifically targeting the Japanese market. 
The lock should work with about 80 percent of all locks in the country, and could be sold either to consumers or to rental businesses or hotels or even businesses. 
Unfortunately Akerun suffered from the dreaded live presentation demo fail so we didn't get to see it in action, but the design looks cool at least! 
Wovn is a service that aims to make more websites accessible to a global audience. 
By adding one line of code to their sites, the product will automatically detect a user's language settings and deliver a localized page to them. 
That will help Japanese website owners, in particular, reach the 95 percent of web users that don't read Japanese. 
In addition to automatically providing a localized version of those sites, Wovn also helps site owners create those new versions, providing either machine translation which is free or work done by a professional translator which it charges for. 
Mobile quiz app Match is an educational tool disguised as a game. 
Like QuizUp, the app lets users match up against one another and answer quiz questions about a variety of topics. 
By adding gamification to education, it hopes to increase user's general knowledge of those categories over time, while also being fun. 
I mean, who doesn't want to have fun while also learning? 
There are about 3 million small businesses in Japan, and Bizer wants to help the people who run those businesses with all the backoffice things they need to take care of. 
The company charges a 2980-yen monthly subscription for the service, which simplifies the process of doing paperwork needed to get employees onboarded and up and running. 
By doing so, it speeds up the process and could lower the costs associated with bringing on new hires. 
FiNC is a service that is focused on helping Japanese people live healthier lives through a mix of data and training. 
The service runs on a monthly subscription and connects users with private diet coaches and gym programs after assessing them for health and fitness, to provide a personalized program for improving their health. 
Spacemarket wants to be like Airbnb for meeting spaces, allowing businesses that have unique spaces to rent them out on its peer-to-peer platform. 
It hopes to enable its customers to book company meetings and retreats in places they wouldn't normally have access to. 
It's not a totally unique idea -- there's a startup in the U.S. called PeerSpace doing the same thing -- but Spacemarket is looking specifically at the Japanese market. 
Yes, they have food delivery apps in Japan, too. 
The trick behind mobile app Bento is providing ultra-fast delivery of ultra-cheap bento boxes that are priced at 500 yen each, which is less than $ 5 US. 
But the company is looking at other potential categories of food -- like coffee, for instance -- and is even considering moving into the broader logistics business with delivery of non-food goods. 
This startup wants to capitalize on the growth of YouTube and make the viewing of videos hosted there a little more social. 
By allowing people to watch videos in viewing parties yTuber.tv is hoping to improve the online video experience and reduce the current loneliness factor. 
To do so, it's also curating the videos, choosing longer-form selections for increased viewing time and engagement. 
OpenLogi wants to simplify the process of shipping for businesses who want easy way to fulfill orders that their customers have placed. 
OpenLogi has built relationships with multiple carriers to ensure the best shipping rates, which it makes transparently available on its website. 
The company has also built an easy platform for fulfilling orders and printing shipping labels, a process which takes more than a dozen clicks when fulfilled by Amazon. 
By contrast, there are only two or three pieces of information and clicks for a customer using OpenLogi's platform. 
As a growing number of entrepreneurs are dipping into creating hardware, the desire to develop their own chipsets for controlling devices has increased. 
The only problem is that custom ASIC development is a frustrating and time-consuming process. 
But not anymore ... AgIC reduces the cost of chip development and the time associated with prototyping by allowing its users to print transistor designs to paper with conductive ink delivered via inkjet printer. 
The cost of the conductive ink cartridges would be about 20,000 yen or about 200 yen less than $ 2 US for each printout. 
The technology makes ASIC development easy, fast, and affordable. 
It's tech that could be used around the globe, and it could open up development to a whole new group of entrepreneurs to create new and interesting hardware devices and applications. 
As a result, the judges thought AgIC had the best largest potential global reach and impact of the companies that presented. 
All of which is why they were happy to award the winning prize and 1,000,000 yen to the startup.

Comcast is launching a new technician tracker through its MyAccount app, which lets you keep an eye on where the Comcast technician that's supposed to be at your house actually is. 
Waiting around for the cable guy to show up is a total pain in the butt and a huge waste of time. 
I never thought I'd say this, but thank you Comcast. 
The new tracker is launching as a trial in Boston, and it basically works exactly the way this should have worked forever. 
When your tech is about 30 minutes away, you 'll get an alert on your phone. 
So that means you don't have to be waiting by the door for the entirety of an appointment window for the cable guy to show up. 
If the trial goes well, the company will launch the service to all of its users in 2015. 
Comcast has a terrible track record when it comes to customer service, so it's refreshing to see it do something nice for a change.

iOS/Android soon: Clipping coupons is a great way to save money on groceries, as long as you're willing to put in the time. 
Milk automatically finds and applies coupons for everything you're buying, so you get all the discounts automatically -- with nothing but a single tap on your phone. 
Milk is from the same people who made Honey, the Chrome extension that finds and applies coupons for whatever you buy on the internet, and automatically applies them. 
Milk works in much the same way -- but in real life. 
Here's how it works: You need a rewards card for the store in question like Kroger or Ralph's, and you need to register an online account for that card. 
Those online accounts allow you to clip online coupons to your card, then just scan the card at checkout to get the discounts. 
Milk automates this entire process by applying all the available coupons to your card in one tap. 
That way, for every item in your cart that has a coupon available, you automatically get the discount, without doing any extra work. 
Once you 've set it up, the process works like this: 
I tested it last night, on a relatively small shopping trip -- just a couple items -- and I saved $ 5 without even trying. 
That's pretty awesome. 
Sure, you may not be able to get as deep a discount as if you were extreme couponing, but for most of us -- who ignore coupons entirely because they're just too much work -- this is a great way to effortlessly save a few bucks. 
It literally only takes one tap on your phone for every trip you take. 
Milk is free for the first three months, and then costs $ 9.99 a year after that or you can buy in monthly installments. 
It seems like a lot, but considering it saved me half of that on only one trip, it's well worth the price -- especially if the alternative is being too lazy to use coupons at all. 
Whether the weather's got you down or you have the Monday Blues, it can be tough to see a way out of a low. 
Take on a goal that requires a lot of willpower. 
Accomplishing it will boost your sense of self-control and morale. 
Willpower is a good thing, but its role is to keep us from things we want to do, so it's not always fun to think about. 
Gretchen Rubin says the end feeling of self-control is powerful enough to make exercising your willpower a big morale booster. 
She explains: 
... I was particularly struck by Isherwood's passing remark, of his cigarette smoking: I had given up the habit with difficulty in 1941, because I was upset about my parting from Vernon and wanted to raise my morale by asserting my willpower. 
I was fascinated by this brief remark. 
He wanted to raise his morale by asserting his willpower.We usually think of an effort like quitting smoking as something that's demanding, draining, a big drag. 
And it is, of course.But it's also interesting to see that an effort like that is also a morale-booster. 
And it's true: whenever we ask something of ourselves, and follow through, we get a big boost in our sense of self-efficacy, our sense of control over ourselves. 
Think about the times you 've been proud of yourself for going back to the gym, giving up soda, or taking on a big project. 
That sense of pride in your self for being in control is enough to pick yourself back up when you're feeling low. 
A Surprising Way to Feel Better About Yourself. 
Have You Tried It? 
| The Happiness Project 
When you start feeling those symptoms of anxiety like clammy hands or butterflies in the stomach, don't concentrate on them. 
Recognize those feelings for what they are a reaction to a perceived threat, remind yourself there really isn't a threat, and double down your focus on the person you're with. 
Really listen to what they're saying, ask follow up questions, and be genuinely curious about the person.If you find yourself slipping back into self-conscious thoughts, remind yourself that no one is likely noticing how nervous you feel. 
Heck, other people probably aren't thinking very much about you because they're so wrapped up in their own thoughts or in what they're about to say. 
You're definitely not the only self-conscious one in the room, and it's okay to feel shy or anxious. 
Accept it, and pull your mind back to what the person is saying, listen actively, and have fun.

Over time, sediment can settle and build up inside of a water heater. 
This can cause your pipes to corrode and lead to plumbing issues down the road. 
Avoid these problems by draining and flushing your water heater at least once a year. 
YouTube user iScaper1 walks you through the process in the video above. 
Flushing your water heater is an easy do-it-yourself project that you can pull off in an hour, with only a garden hose and a pair of channel lock pliers. 
Water heaters can be powered by electricity, natural gas or oil. 
Make sure the power supply is switched off or at a lower setting before making any changes to your water heater. 
There's nothing better than finding that special bar. 
The one that has your favorite scotch, or makes a mean margarita, or plays the perfect music. 
Finding that special bar, on the other hand, can be a real pain in the ass. 
That's why NightOwl is launching in NYC. 
The app works almost exactly like Foursquare, but with an exclusive focus on nightlife, including bars and clubs and non-food nightly gatherings. 
As soon as you sign up NightOwl will ask you to list a few of your favorite spots. 
Based on what you said, NightOwl use your location to make a few suggestions about what's cool nearby. 
As you visit more bars, you can record your favorite spots by adding a tag for the bar. 
You might tag it with outdoor space or cocktails or great music. 
If the tag already exists at that bar, you can simply tap on it to make it your own. 
By adding tags, you're creating your own personalized lists for various bars. 
And of course, each tag is totally searchable. 
The big difference, however, is that NightOwl has various levels of privacy on each tag. 
You can share it publicly, privately with friends, or anonymously. 
The idea here is that in the nightlife scene, there are certain things you might want to be discreet about. 
NightOwl gives you the privacy you might want over everything you save in the app, simply using the tags to inform others and only revealing your association with them if you want. 
Ready for another GIF keyboard for iOS 8? 
Blippy has returned today with a new app that lets you create, save and discover new GIFs to use when messaging with your friends on your iPhone. 
The app serves to replace the earlier, also GIF-focused, Blippy iOS app, that was pulled from the App Store back in September. 
Those with long Internet memories may remember the name Blippy as being associated with that startup that tried and failed to socialize consumer shopping data. 
But in 2013, a different group of entrepreneurs launched a new Blippy after acquiring the Blippy domain from its prior owners. 
That app, which also made it possible to find and make animated GIFs, eventually grew to over 10,000 users. 
However, it arrived at a time before iOS 8, meaning it was a standalone experience. 
Ultimately, that may have limited its growth. 
In September 2014, the company pulled Blippy from the App Store in anticipation of creating a new experience for iOS 8, which was then just arriving. 
We had been working on a simplification of the core experience in preparation for a relaunch because we were really excited about our ability to deliver the experience we always wanted with the custom keyboards of iOS 8, explains co-founder David King, a serial entrepreneur who sold his social gaming company Green Patch to Playdom which sold to Disney prior to starting the new Blippy. 
The new Blippy app, out today on the iTunes App Store, offers a simple interface for finding, saving and using GIFs. 
Users can upload any GIF from their Camera Roll into the app or search the internet to find GIFs they like. 
That latter option is notable since some of the GIF keyboard competitors have more limited libraries to select from. 
In addition, Blippy's particular focus is on allowing its users to build their own custom keyboard using their collected GIFs. 
Instead of always searching for new GIFs every time you want to jazz up your iMessage conversations, Blippy lets you save your favorites for easy access. 
As you browse through search results, swiping right lets you add the GIF to your collection for later use. 
The app is now one of many new GIF-focused iOS 8 keyboards available, including Riffsy, Kanvas, PopKey, and others. 
Frankly, I'm having a hard time choosing my favorite. 
I find they each have their strengths. 
But I'm loading up Blippy today to give it a spin, too. 
What good is a job search site or app when you're not looking for a job? 
That's the issue TheLadders is tackling with the launch of a new version of its iOS app and a new feature that it calls the Job Market Guide. 
CEO Alex Douzet told me that these are the first steps in a new direction for the company, which was founded in 2003. 
TheLadders was initially aimed at people looking for jobs that paid more than $ 100,000, before expanding its focus to a broader range of careers and salaries in recent years. 
At this point, Douzet argued that the job search problem has been mostly solved, not just by TheLadders but by other sites like LinkedIn and Indeed. 
However, he said there's still an opportunity to expand, because professionals usually only change jobs every three to four years. 
A site like TheLadders is not really doing much for them in between -- something he's hoping to change with these products, and with other ideas in the pipeline. 
Let's start with the updated app, which is launching today. 
Douzet pointed out that even if you're not looking for a job, there's a good chance you're working on a team that needs to find good people fill open positions, or you may be able to help out a friend who's trying to do the same. 
And while online job referrals aren't a new idea, the app that Douzet and his team showed me yesterday offers a casual, convenient way to make those recommendations. 
When you post a job opening in the app, you just enter a few basic details -- your company, the title, the location, and a description, which can't go longer than 200 words. 
The listing then shows up in the newsfeeds of your connections in the app, and those connections can recommend people in their network. 
If both the poster and the person being referred like the recommendation, then they can start chatting with each other in the app. 
You can also recommend people who aren't already members of TheLadders, who are then asked to download the app. 
The fact that TheLadders built this specifically for mobile could also be key. 
I'm no great connector, but even I can think of times when I was at an after-work event, or having dinner with a friend, and a job opening came up. 
I'd think, Oh man, I know someone who'd be perfect for this -- then I'd have to make a note to myself to follow-up once I was at a computer again, which sometimes happened, and sometimes didn't. 
By focusing on mobile, TheLadders allows you to take action right away in those situations. 
The company will also continue to offer the existing job search features in the app, which launched last year. 
Douzet said added that the majority of TheLadders' mobile usage is on iOS, so that's where the focus is right now, but he acknowledged, When we see the usage really, taking off, we will have to address Android by introducing the new referral features to the existing Android app. 
The Job Market Guide, meanwhile, is supposed to launch in full next week, but the company is releasing a more limited, sneak preview version today. 
The idea is to aggregate all the data from TheLadders' 7 million-plus registered users and give people access to up-to-date information about their chosen professions. 
For example, I looked up the data for writers in New York City, bringing up a page that includes the average salary, the current level of competitiveness, and a list of the best cities for that career which is determined by a combination of salary, competitiveness, and cost-of-living. 
You can also see the kinds of skills needed for jobs in that profession and set up email alerts for changes and listings. 
Douzet said TheLadders' guide is unique because the data reflects what users are saying now, not what was reported in a study months or years ago, and it's attuned to local differences -- not just in salaries but also in the skills that employers are looking for, which can vary from city to city. 
He also argued that users on TheLadders have an incentive to be honest about their salaries, because that helps them to find relevant jobs: If they lie about their current compensation, they find out very quickly that it's not going to be useful for them. 
Asked if the data is skewed towards those high-income jobs that TheLadders started with, Douzet said the ratio between jobs paying less than versus more than $ 100,000 a year is now two-to-one. 
That may not be a perfect representation of the American workforce, but the company says the size and breadth of its user base is enough to make the data meaningful. 
As far as longer term career planning, Douzet said TheLadders doesn't try to tell you what kind of job you might have a decade from now, because careers don't always follow an obvious, linear path: There's no product you can build that can predict in 5, 10 years where they should go. 
However, the job profiles link to profiles for related jobs, so if you're writer looking to become an editor, you can get a sense of how much additional experiences and what new skills you need. 
You can download the new app here and see a preview of the Job Market Guide here. 
Oh, and you don't need to be a member of TheLadders to browse the guide.

That access to consumer data is one of the big selling points behind Gumroad, a startup that allows creators to sell directly to fans. 
The Gumroad folks were actually the ones who put me in touch with Leslie to discuss a Gumroad-powered promotion that he launched today -- the sale of 10 limited edition scarves, costing $ 400 each. 
Those scarves doubled as VIP tickets to Leslie's upcoming New Year's Eve concert in Vienna, Austria, where he said he 'll be performing his new album MZRT for the first time. 
And they sold out in less than an hour -- it may have helped that Gumroad was one of the launch partners for Twitter's buy button, and fans could could buy the scarves directly from the tweet. 
Why scarves? 
Well, I asked Leslie and he talked about how they represent the journey that he's taken from growing up in a working class family to Harvard to a successful music career. 
complete with trips to Fashion Week. 
His fans, he said, may have big dreams, even if they may or may not be able to get that Fashion Week invitation, and those scarves suggest they might be able to fulfill those dreams. 
It probably seems a little less random when you recall that Leslie also offers apparel through his #Renegades fan club. 
Selling 10 $ 400 scarves is cool, but it's only part of Leslie's broader strategy, one that he said has brought him $ 400,000 in direct-to-consumer sales, plus $ 1.6 million in touring revenue since he went independent. 
So the truism about musicians making most of their money from touring is holding true in this case ... 
Leslie's isn't just applying this strategy to his own career. 
He also launched a startup earlier this year called Disruptive Multimedia -- it aims to help artists connect with their fans directly. 
The classic number there is 1,000 true fans, a term coined by Kevin Kelly. 
In our conversation, Leslie was more likely to refer to 10,000 or 20,000 people, though he also mentioned a Disruptive Media clients who were able to turn virtually all of their fans, even if they were only 150 of them, into paying customers. 
Leslie also suggested one benefit that I hadn't thought of when it comes to depending on a relatively small group of fans -- it frees you up to experiment, because even if you alienate your existing fans, finding another 1,000 or even 10,000 or 20,000 is a lot less daunting than trying to maintain a massively huge fanbase. 
In Leslie's case, he said it allowed him to move away from the R&B that he'd focused on while with a major label to create a fairly progressive rap album. 
Youbetme says it launched the app in January. 
The company bills itself as a way to bet on anything, at any time, either through its iOS app or it's website. 
To be clear, it doesn't support real-money betting, but rather tracking friendly bets with friends. 
You could probably put money on those bets, just not through the app itself ... There's also an Android app in beta testing. 
Investors in the round included SierraMaya360, DVG, and Abingdon Capital. 
Angel investor Brad Stroh is joining the Youbetme board of directors. 
The company has already built a library of 115,000 video clips, backgrounds, and effects, which it either created itself or licensed from others. 
Customers can use any of the content in that library for a subscription fee of $ 79 a month or $ 99 a year. 
According to founder and CEO Joel Holland, that averages out to less than $ 1 per clip for most customers. 
Holland described the VideoBlocks library a very high quality archive of content that's not super deep. 
As a result, customers would often start their search for stock footage at VideoBlocks after all, they'd already paid the subscription fee, so there was no extra cost, but they'd have to often have to go elsewhere to fill in the gaps. 
That's where the new marketplace comes in. 
It's not yet open to VideoBlocks customers, but the company is beginning its outreach to potential contributors. 
The goal, Holland said, is to offer the same footage that you'd find on a site like Shutterstock, but at a 40 percent discount, and with 100 percent of the money going to the contributor. 
Shutterstock pays a 30 percent royalty for every clip purchased. 
You 've heard this saying, ` Content is king, ''' Holland said. 
If that's true, content creators should be treated like royalty. 
So how does VideoBlocks make money from this? 
Well, you need an account to access the marketplace. 
And after a brief trial period, that means paying for a subscription.

When Sen. Mitch McConnell R-Ky. 
first entered politics in the 1960s, he started out as moderate -- pro-abortion rights, pro-union, in support of the civil rights movement. 
With time, McConnell shifted to the right as the Republican Party shifted. 
I was just really startled by this when I started looking into it, Alec MacGillis tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross. 
I knew that he had started out as somewhat more moderate -- but I didn't realize just how moderate he really was. 
There was no question what had happened -- that McConnell had won basically on the coattails of Ronald Reagan, MacGillis says. 
And McConnell looked at that very, very close result and basically thought to himself, ` You know what? 
I don't want it to ever be this close again. 
I see where the Republican Party is heading ; I see where my state is heading ; I see where the South is heading politically -- and I need to get on that train.' 
There was a big battle back in the Republican Party in the '60s between the conservative wing and a still quite strong moderate wing. 
This is, of course, during the time of Barry Goldwater's 1964 nomination to the party coming from the conservative wing. 
But there was still a very, very strong moderate contingent of the party and Mitch McConnell was completely on that side of the line. 
He was very firmly pro-union. 
In his first election back in 1977 in Louisville, he got the endorsement of the AFL-CIO because he backed collective bargaining for public employees, which is something even a lot of Democrats today don't support. 
He sought out the head of the AFL-CIO at the bowling alley in Louisville and sweet-talked him and got his support. 
He was very firmly in support of the civil rights movement, which back in Kentucky was not necessarily the obvious thing to do. 
He, as a student, would show up at civil rights rallies and was very much in favor of the legislation in Washington in the '60s. 
McConnell really embodies that shift because he himself has evolved with that transformation just to a tee. 
But at the same time ... he embodies for me the mindset that has become more and more dominant in Washington today ... which is the permanent campaign mindset. 
It's the mindset that all that really matters is the next election, the next cycle. 
It's not so much what you do when you're in power in Washington ; it's what you do to position yourself for the next time around, your next re-election, your party's next election cycle. 
That mindset has become very prevalent. 
It's bipartisan and it also suffuses the media -- but McConnell embodies it really more than anybody else. 
He is a master of Senate procedure. 
That's one of his real strengths. 
... He just has studied it very, very closely. 
-LSB- He's -RSB- studied how it works ... and figured out how you could use ... -LSB- the rules -RSB- within this sort of very vague culture-based and nebulous realm of the Senate where these rules are not necessarily written down anywhere -- some of them are, but others are just things that have carried over in tradition and culture of the institution. 
He's figured out how you can use these procedures -- and also the customs that have built up over time to really slow things down and gum up the works in ways that hadn't been done before. 
It's something he campaigned for more aggressively than just about anyone before him. 
His colleagues in the Senate were struck to see just how determined and eager he was to climb the ladder. 
And what he would do is he would start quite early, several years before the elections for these various leadership posts, he would start strategizing in how to win those elections. 
He had a wingman, his colleague -LSB- former Sen. -RSB- Bob Bennett from Utah ... -LSB- who -RSB- would go out a year or two in advance and start trying to count up votes and feel people out on whether they would support Mitch or someone else. 
... 
Again, McConnell was not the most naturally popular or beloved person within his caucus, so he really needed help from someone else to kind of go out and line up those votes for him. 
They would badmouth the opposition and various rivals for various jobs ... really, in a junior high school kind of way -- trying to line up support so that when the time came for the elections for the various leadership posts high up the ladder, it suddenly would become clear that McConnell had, in fact, lined up just enough support to get the job.

It's no sealed-in-box copy of Chrono Trigger or, better yet, Gamma Attack, but that's some pretty insane overnight inflation. 
Still wondering what exactly homebrew is? 
Think of it sort of like jailbreaking an iPhone. 
Nintendo likes to keep a pretty tight hold on what can run on their console -- this opens the door to things they probably wouldn't approve of. 
Things like emulators, one-off indie games, etc.. 
What it doesn't allow for or at least, isn't meant for is piracy. 
These homebrew hacks are often custom tailored to not run bootleg copies of retail games -- though, more often than not, the pirates find a way. 
The video above demonstrates the exploit in action -- but if you're more interested in getting it up and running yourself on your 3DS, you can find the details here.

To honor the 25th anniversary of the Wall's demise and the artist's 69th birthday this year, Sanborn has decided to reveal a new clue to help solve his iconic and enigmatic artwork. 
It's only the second hint he's released since the sculpture was unveiled in 1990 and may finally help unlock the fourth and final section of the encrypted sculpture, which frustrated sleuths have been struggling to crack for more than two decades. 
The 12-foot-high, verdigrised copper, granite and wood sculpture on the grounds of the CIA complex in Langley, Virginia, contains four encrypted messages carved out of the metal, three of which were solved years ago. 
The fourth is composed of just 97 letters, but its brevity belies its strength. 
Even the NSA, whose master crackers were the first to decipher other parts of the work, gave up on cracking it long ago. 
So four years ago, concerned that he might not live to see the mystery of Kryptos resolved, Sanborn released a clue to help things along, revealing that six of the last 97 letters when decrypted spell the word Berlin -- a revelation that many took to be a reference to the Berlin Wall. 
To that clue today, he's adding the next word in the sequence -- clock -- that may or may not throw a wrench in this theory. 
Now the Kryptos sleuths just have to unscramble the remaining 86 characters to find out. 
Sanborn told WIRED that he's always been fascinated by Berlin's many clocks but the Berlin Clock in particular has intrigued him the most. 
The clock, also known as the Berlin Uhr or Set Theory Clock, was designed in the 1970s by inventor and tinkerer Dieter Binninger. 
It displays the time through illuminated colored blocks rather than numbers and requires the viewer to calculate the time based on a complex scheme. 
A yellow lamp at the top of the clock blinks every two seconds while a row of red lamps beneath it represent five hours. 
Red lights on a second row denote one hour each, and time is calculated based on the number of lights illuminated. 
So if in the first line 2 lamps are lit and in the second line 3 lamps, it's 5 +5 +3 = 13h or 1 p.m., notes one description of the timepiece. 
Most people have no idea who Dieter is and all of the other people who make strange clocks in Berlin, Sanborn says. 
There's a very interesting back story to -LSB- the Berlin Clock -RSB-. 
Clock could easily refer instead to a method devised by a Polish mathematician and cryptologist during World War II to crack Germany's Enigma ciphers -- a method that was expanded on by Alan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park who are credited with ultimately cracking Enigma. 
It may be no coincidence that Sanborn has decided to release his new clue at the same time as The Imitation Game, a film about Turing's work on Enigma, is opening in US theaters on Nov. 28. 
The artwork features a large block of petrified wood standing upright, with a tall copper plate scrolling out from the wood like a sheet of paper. 
At the sculpture's base is a round pool with a fountain pump that sends water moving in a circular direction around the pool. 
Carved out of the copper plate are approximately 1,800 letters, some of them forming a cryptographic table based on a method developed by a 16th-century Frenchman named Blaise de Vigenere. 
In 1995 a small group of cryptanalysts inside the NSA quietly deciphered the first three sections of the sculpture, though no one outside the agency and the CIA's top brass knew about it. 
In 1998, CIA analyst David Stein cracked the same three messages using paper and pencil and about 400 lunch-time hours. 
Only his CIA colleagues knew of his success, however, because the agency didn't publicize it. 
A year later, California computer scientist Jim Gillogly gained public notoriety when he cracked the same three messages using a Pentium II. 
It was totally invisible. 
How's that possible? 
They used the earth's magnetic field. 
x The information was gathered and transmitted undergruund to an unknown location. 
x Does Langley know about this? 
They should: it's buried out there somewhere. 
x Who knows the exact location? 
Only WW. 
This was his last message. 
x Thirty eight degrees fifty seven minutes six point five seconds north, seventy seven degrees eight minutes forty four seconds west. 
x Layer two. 
WW, Sanborn told WIRED in 2005, refers to William Webster, director of the CIA at the time of the sculpture's completion. 
Sanborn was forced to provide Webster with the solution to the puzzle to reassure the CIA that it wasn't something that would embarrass the agency. 
Slowly, desparatly slowly, the remains of passage debris that encumbered the lower part of the doorway was removed. 
With trembling hands I made a tiny breach in the upper left-hand corner. 
And then, widening the hole a little, I inserted the candle and peered in. 
The hot air escaping from the chamber caused the flame to flicker, but presently details of the room within emerged from the mist. 
x Can you see anything? 
q 
Sanborn has said that the first three sections contain clues to solving the final 97 letters but no one has figured out what those might be. 
After no progress cracking the last section, Sanborn released the Berlin clue four years ago, considering it a significant clue. 
I'm throwing it out there. 
It just makes that many fewer characters people have to figure out, he told WIRED at the time. 
Code detectives worked to crack the puzzle following the Berlin revelation. 
Members of a popular Kryptos Yahoo Group led by Elonka Dunin, the foremost expert on Kryptos, tried for months to resolve it but to no avail. 
Who knows if the new clue will prove to be any more helpful. 
And even if it is and sleuths decipher the final code, there's an additional message they will still need to resolve. 
Once decrypted, the fourth section reveals a riddle, which Sanborn has said requires sleuths to be on the CIA grounds to solve. 
In part of the code that's been deciphered, I refer to an act that took place when I was at the agency and a location that's on the ground of the agency, Sanborn said during a 2005 interview with WIRED. 
So in order to find that place, you have to decipher the piece and then go to the agency and find that place. 
Dunin has suggested that the coordinates may refer to the location of a Berlin Wall monument on the CIA grounds. 
Three slabs from the Berlin Wall sit at the spy agency's headquarters, a gift from the German government. 
Sanborn has also told WIRED that the collapse of the wall was big news at the time he was casting about for things he wanted to include in his sculpture. 
However, the wall monument wasn't dedicated at the CIA until 1992, two years after Kryptos was unveiled. 
Although the coordinates of the monument's location -- 38 57 2.5 N, 77 8 40 W -- differ from the coordinates mentioned in Kryptos by four seconds in both the latitude and longitude, Dunin has speculated that the CIA may have originally planned to position the monument at the coordinates Sanborn mentions on Kryptos but then later chose a different location. 
Alternatively, Sanborn may have been using an incorrect U.S. geological map when he created his sculpture and thus got the coordinates wrong, she notes. 
After all, Sanborn has other errors in his sculpture, both intentional and unintentional. 
Kryptos includes intentional spelling errors and misaligned characters set higher on a line of text than characters around them. 
But in 2006, Sanborn realized he had also made an inadvertent error, a missing x that he mistakenly deleted from the end of a line in section two, a section that was already solved. 
He discovered the omission while doing a letter-by-letter comparison of the plaintext and coded text in preparation for a book about his work. 
The x was supposed to signify a period or section-break at the end of a phrase. 
Sanborn removed it for aesthetic reasons, thinking it wouldn't affect the way the puzzle was deciphered, but in fact it did. 
What sleuths had until then deciphered to say ID by rows was actually supposed to say layer two. 
The correction hasn't helped anyone solve the rest of the puzzle, however, in the subsequent years. 
Now this second clue, Sanborn hopes, will reinvigorate efforts to crack the mystery, though he has mixed views on whether he wants the journey to end. 
The artist has said he'd like to see Kryptos solved in his lifetime, but he also enjoys that some of the smartest minds in cryptography -- including those at the CIA and NSA -- continue to be baffled by his work. 
Only two other people, aside from Sanborn, were initially said to know the solution to Kryptos: one was the retired chairman of the CIA's Cryptographic Center Ed Scheidt, who helped Sanborn choose and alter the coding techniques for the sculpture. 
The other was William Webster, the CIA director who received a sealed envelope containing the solution at the sculpture's dedication. 
However, in 2005 Sanborn revealed to WIRED that Scheidt and Webster only thought they knew the solution. 
In fact, he had deceived them. 
In November 1989, after the East German government announced that its citizens were free from then on to cross over the Wall into West Berlin and West Germany, crowds of euphoric Germans began chipping away at the cement barrier. 
With this new clue provided by Sanford, let the chipping away on Kryptos begin. 
I won't be able to post many or any posts on Beyond Apollo in the next few weeks because of holiday and work travel. 
I 'll be hauling along research material when I travel I always do, but I doubt that I 'll have time to do much more than take notes. 
The good news is that I 'll be visiting Washington, DC, for the first time in several years, and I 've built a personal day into my meeting schedule to do some archival research. 
I hope to be able to photocopy or scan some new documents to write about in the Smithsonian archives at the Udvar-Hazy facility, which I have not visited before. 
My meetings are at the Smithsonian on the National Mall, and I look forward to breaking away, if possible, to have a look at the National Air and Space Museum. 
I last visited in 2000, so I expect that it has changed a great deal since then. 
As always, I thank you for reading Beyond Apollo. 
I appreciate your comments and suggestions. 
To conclude this post, I want to let any night-sky fans out there know about a disturbing development in Flagstaff, Arizona. 
Located 7000 feet above sea level in ponderosa pine forests on the flank of an extinct volcano, this city of 60,000 people is home to Lowell Observatory, the U.S. Naval Observatory, the U.S. Geological Survey's Astrogeology Science Center, Northern Arizona University's recently upgraded observatory, and other educational and science institutions. 
Most of these institutions have a global reach -- actually, an interplanetary reach, because scientists based at many of them are involved in missions to Pluto, Saturn, Ceres, and other places. 
For its innovative dark-skies policies, Flagstaff was designated world's first International Dark-Sky City in 2001. 
Nevertheless, dark-sky advocates -- only a few of whom work for the observatories, it turns out -- continue to fight off challenges to Flagstaff's dark-skies zoning rules. 
Occasionally the city government is seduced by the light side ; usually, as is now the case, when big-money development is promised. 
Often this happens when members of the city council fail to understand the contribution the science institutions in Flagstaff make to the community. 
They pump millions of dollars into this small city on an on-going basis, and have done so at least since the U.S. Naval Observatory came to town in the 1950s. 
In addition, Flagstaff's science institutions support local science and technology education. 
One example is Flagstaff's annual two-week Festival of Science, which takes place every September, but support for schools, teachers, and students continues throughout the year. 
I wrote about Flagstaff's long and successful battle to keep its skies dark. 
You can find my article here, on the website of the Flagstaff Dark Skies Coalition. 
The latest challenge to Flagstaff's dark skies is well described here. 
It is an apartment complex on the road leading to the U.S. Naval Observatory. 
A vote will be held December 2. 
A defeat for dark skies in Flagstaff will send a negative message to other towns and cities near observatories all around the world. 
If you wish to tell the Flagstaff city government that the world is watching what it does next, you can do so by sending email to the addresses below: 
The legislation, proposed by Utah lawmaker Marc Roberts, is due to go to the floor of the Utah House of Representatives early next year, but it was debated in a Public Utilities and Technology Interim Committee meeting on Wednesday. 
The bill, H.B. 161, directs municipalities like Bluffdale to refuse support to any federal agency which collects electronic data within this state. 
The NSA brought its Bluffdale data center online about a year ago, taking advantage Utah's cheap power and a cut-rate deal for millions of gallons of local water, used to cool the 1-million-square-foot building's servers. 
Roberts' bill, however, would prohibit the NSA from negotiating new water deals when its current Bluffdale agreement runs out in 2021. 
The law seems like a long-shot to clear legislative hurdles when Utah's legislature re-convenes next year, but Wednesday's committee hearing was remarkable, nonetheless, says Nate Carlisle, a reporter with the Salt Lake Tribune who has waged a fight with the NSA and Bluffdale officials to determine how much water the data center is actually using. 
What's noteworthy is no one on the panel said: ` Hey, wait a minute, we can't do this,' he says. 
They had some specific concerns about the language of the bill, but there was no outright opposition. 
Instead, they simply listened to testimony on the NSA and Bluffdale's support of the center. 
I just don't want to subsidize what they're doing on the back of our citizens, Carlisle quotes Republican Representative Roger Barrus as saying during the meeting. 
Utah has a long history of disputes with the federal government, but this is the first time Carlisle remembers anyone proposing to cut off water to a federal agency. 
I think it's representative of an attitude change in Utah that the bill is even being discussed, he says. 
The web is funded by ads. 
But so many people hate seeing them, and they often resent all the data tracking that props them up. 
It's a clash that has become a major pain point for news websites and other publishers. 
The rise of ad blockers, which let people surf the web without these annoying ads, is also blocking their revenue. 
Launched on Thursday, the service is called Google Contributor, and it asks you to pay $ 1, $ 2, or $ 3 a month to back the websites you particularly like. 
In exchange for your support, you 'll see thank you messages where ads used to be -- at least on the websites that participate in the program. 
At the moment, Google is testing the idea with ten online publishers, including The Onion, ScienceDaily, Urban Dictionary, and Mashable. 
The thank-you notes are served up through Google's existing advertising channels, and Google still takes a cut of each contribution. 
According to Google, the $ 1 to $ 3 users pay essentially covers the cost of that ad space. 
But all of this is subject to change, she says, as the platform develops. 
At this point, what we 've rolled out is very much an experiment, a Google spokesperson tells us. 
We're getting the publishers on board today. 
We 'll see not just how it works but also the public interest level. 
This type of thinking makes sense. 
If people are going to gripe constantly about ads and having their personal data sold to advertisers, why not ask them to put a nominal amount of money where their mouths are? 
Google Contributor tries to appeal to readers' sense of ethics, urging them to believe that the content they enjoy is well worth spending $ 1 a month. 
But this approach may be too little, far too late. 
People are already used to getting content online for free. 
As much as they hate ads and ad tracking, they hate paying for free stuff even more. 
It's not unlike what happened to the music industry back in the early 2000s. 
Once people realized they could download music for free, the industry had to take legal action against companies like Napster in order to convince listeners to start paying again. 
Now, easy and instant transactions through platforms like iTunes make the whole paying-for-music thing a little more palatable. 
What's more, fans are even beginning to come down on the side of artists, when they feel music platforms are robbing them of their fair share. 
The Spotify-Taylor Swift fallout is only the most recent example. 
The publishing industry is now finding itself at a similar crossroads, trying to convince the world that the articles and videos they're consuming are actually worth something. 
But appealing to people's ethical duty isn't a surefire way of winning over the masses. 
That's one reason why publishers like The New York Times, which has had moderate success with paywalls, have to charge a lot more than $ 1 a month for digital subscriptions. 
They count on the fact that some readers will do the cost-benefit analysis and decide that access to the Times isn't worth the money, and that's for one of the most highly respected publications on the web. 
Now imagine the challenge a publication like ScienceDaily would face if it started charging. 
And while Google's partner websites won't track contributors' behavior, that doesn't change the fact that every other website will. 
It's that widespread culture of data collection that will be the toughest to overcome .1 
Still, for all its potential drawbacks, Contributor could solve a lot of problems on the web today. 
It could save publishers who are struggling to stay afloat as ad dollars dwindle, while also giving consumers what they say they want. 
Now, we 'll have to see just how much they want it. 
1. 
Update: After publishing, Google amended its statement to WIRED on how user behavior will be tracked through Google Contributor. 
The story has been updated to clarify. 
Last year, a man named Carlin Dunne raced an electric motorcycle in the Pikes Peak International Hillclimb. 
He reached the summit in a blistering 10 minutes flat, handily beating his closest competitor through the mountain's 156 curves by 21 seconds. 
That kind of time is impressive for a gasoline-powered superbike. 
It is downright amazing for an electric motorcycle. 
There is now a street legal version of that beast, the LS-218 from Lightning Motorcycles. 
It was designed by two people whose names are synonymous with batshit insane electric motorcycles. 
It is not cheap, coming in at $ 38,800. 
But then, things like this rarely are. 
The LS-218's defining distinction is its utterly absurd top speed. 
It hit 218 mph at Bonneville, and yes, that was a one-time thing under tightly controlled circumstances, but it still hit it. 
It's also got the official electric motorcycle record of 215.96 mph. 
To put that number in perspective, the McLaren 650C tops out at 207, and the current king of street-legal, mass-produced two wheelers, the Kawasaki ZZR1400, ekes out a relatively paltry 186 mph. 
Of course, that kind of speed is only useful in a straight line. 
And a bike like this is all. 
About. 
The curves. 
If Dunne's sprint up Pike's Peak -- 156 turns over 12.42 miles -- is any indication, the LS-218 can stand tall alongside the best internal combustion machines. 
Back in 2011, the fastest electric two-wheeler to complete Pikes Peak finished a full 1:39 behind the first place finisher, a Ducati Multistrada ridden by none other than Carlin Dunne. 
Two years later he was back on a Lightning, and he proceeded to dust every motorcycle in the field. 
Yes, a lot of that can be attributed to the skill of the rider. 
But the LS-218 appears to have the kit, too: RaceTech fork, Ohlins shock, Brembo brakes, Marchesini wheels. 
Lightning claims the oil-cooled motor produces 168 pound-feet of torque and the equivalent of 200 horsepower, in a bike with a claimed weight of 495 pounds. 
The torque is nuts for a superbike, but the horsepower figures are par for the course at the top tier of performance motorcycles. 
Lightning, like Mission Motorcycles and Zero Motorcycles, is based in California. 
It's been playing with electricity since 2006 and, like Energica, started with racing. 
Antecedents to the LS-218 competed in events like the 2012 TTXGP/e-Power race at Laguna Seca and, of course, Pikes Peak. 
Now it's wading into the consumer market. 
The chief architects are longtime electric motorcycle innovators Eva Hakansson and Chip Yates who's also got a thing for electric aviation. 
Lightning, which is taking orders, just delivered its first bike to Troy Helming, a clean-energy executive who reserved one about a year ago. 
This being an electric motorcycle, the two biggest questions, after price, are how far it 'll go and how long it 'll take to charge. 
Lightning claims the standard 12 kW/hour lithium-ion pack is good for 100 miles at highway speeds, but based on our experience with electric motorcycles, you can expect 60 to 80 in real-world riding and maybe 40 if you're attacking the back roads. 
Lightning offers optional packs of 15 and 20 kW/hr, which bumps claimed range to as much as 150 and 180 miles, respectively. 
When the battery's dead, you're looking at two hours plugged into a Level 2 charger, which uses 220 volts like your dryer. 
The question remains as to how viable a machine like this is. 
You can buy a garage full of top-shelf motorcycles for 38 large, and your buddies will leave you in the dust after 40 miles of spirited back-road riding. 
But companies like Lightning and Tesla are showing that electric vehicles need not be boring. 
Here's hoping that Lightning, like Tesla, continues honing the technology's leading edge, and apply it to more mainstream machines. 
These days, you can hardly have a technology conversation without talking about the Internet of Things IoT. 
And when that conversation shifts its focus to the industrial sector, including energy, Oil & Gas, Power & Utilities, and petrochemicals, among others, the discussion changes to what is being called the Industrial Internet of Things IIoT. 
So what is all this hype about? 
The convergence of cheap processing, unending storage, massive bandwidth, near-ubiquitous connectivity, and cloud-based applications is driving new capabilities for gathering information and changing the way we interact with machines and services. 
The data generated by sensors in this network of connected devices is being collected and analyzed, spawning the growth of big data analytics and applications. 
And the resulting analytics are being used to improve business efficiency, better serve customers and disrupt old business models. 
There will be nearly 26 billion connected devices by 2020, according to Gartner, which is an increase of 30 fold over 2009. 
Impressive, but what does it really mean to have all these devices connected to the internet? 
Is there any real value involved? 
Just because you can, does it mean that you should? 
We all remember the technology boom and bust of the late 1990s and early 2000s aka Dot-com Bubble that was fueled by an excessive amount of wishful thinking or irrational exuberance. 
But the IIoT can and will be different -- if we keep our collective eyes on the prize. 
Unlike consumer-based IoT that is trying to devise a way to make your world a better place by telling you when your washing machine needs service or letting you control all of your home's systems while you are away, the IIoT is working to make our collective world a better place by improving the monitoring, control and safety of everything around us. 
In short, reducing risk and improving the reliability of our massive industrial systems. 
No small task given the amount of data that will be generated by all of those devices running around the clock. 
Think about it: How good is your computer without a good operating system to make all those programs function properly, or your smartphone without a million apps to connect you and your friends or coworkers and the information you share? 
Large hardware vendors recognized long ago that it is the software that makes the hardware more valuable. 
Software supports the human interaction side of the equation by helping to turn data into information. 
But not just basic information, I am talking about critical, insightful, influential, and actionable information, without which we run the risk of potentially dangerous outcomes. 
This next-generation software should be cloud-based because, let's face it -- on-premises solutions require significantly more time, money and resources than you would like to afford while trying to remain competitive. 
Advanced software should easily connect the existing enterprise asset management EAM or computerized maintenance management system CMMS with the field-based industrial devices and equipment. 
It should provide early, rapid insight into the volumes of data and information that mere mortals are expected to evaluate to find business opportunities and make recommendations as part of a larger asset performance management strategy. 
But more importantly, software should make it easier for your organization to achieve its highest objective: operational excellence. 
Even in today's increasing connected environment, industrial organizations do little more than make use of a minimal set of vendor-supplied analytics related to machine-specific solutions -- automated instrument calibration, instant vibration analysis of pumps and compressors, or other equipment related algorithms. 
The analytical capabilities of affordable processing and storage capacity in new software solutions are just beginning to be tapped. 
One key to discussing the software needs of the IIoT is to include asset performance diagnostics. 
More specifically, to take advantage of all the useful information out there and the connectivity promised by equipment and software vendors, we need to discuss asset performance diagnostics ; the ability to quickly assess a plant's equipment/asset status or ` health'. 
This ability can be critical for merger and acquisition activity versus building new. 
This implies that we must be able to check across many equipment types, not just one or two manufacturer-specific reports, in order to understand where our metrics stand in relation to our industry peers. 
Additionally, with next-generation software, organizations will gain enhanced asset reliability and comparative analysis for operational goals. 
Operators can perform better and faster analysis on collected data to report to the C-Suite executives, who then have better context for defining strategic goals. 
Comparative analytics provide the ability to internally compare the status and performance of the equipment or assets to get your own house in order and really ignite your continuous improvement initiatives. 
Next-generation software must help organizations take it to the next level. 
To get there, you need to benchmark your operations against your peers and competitors. 
That capability will help you move to the pinnacle of continuous improvement, and closer to overall operational excellence. 
There is an enormous amount of data generated today and as new sensors are introduced in global industrial facilities, big data will become even bigger. 
Organizations still struggle with how to leverage that data operationally and strategically to better manage reliability strategy, operational risk and facility operations, which is why we need to insert software into our discussion of the IIoT. 
Google and Facebook don't just run your email and your social network. 
So often, they're a core part of your online identity. 
They help you log in to countless other services across the net. 
This is a handy thing. 
You don't have to remember as many usernames and passwords, but it's also dangerous. 
You're putting all your eggs in one basket. 
What if your Google account gets hacked or suspended? 
Not only would you lose your email address and potentially everything tied to it, but you'd lose access all those other internet services too. 
And then there are the privacy issues -- you can't control how the data these companies gather about you is used. 
A new group called Indie Hosters wants change this. 
They want to give you a web identity that you have complete control over -- and they want to make it just as easy as signing up for Facebook. 
The idea behind Indie Hosters is to create a network of web hosts that use a set of common standards, take care of geeky technical details of maintaining your identity, and, crucially, make it dead simple to move from one Indie Hosting provider to another with no hassle. 
Each host will be an independent business, and you, not the host, will own and control your identity. 
Through these hosts, you can not only log in to a wide range of other websites, but also published your own stuff to the web. 
So far, there are only two members of the network, the project's founders Michiel de Jong and Pierre Ozoux. 
But they hope more hosts will join them, and today, the team launched a crowdfunding campaign to work on building the tools and network to make that happen. 
Indie Hosters is part of what's called the indie web movement, a loose knit bunch of programmers, designers, and activists who think you should own your own web content and online identity. 
For the past few years, indie webbers have advocated that everyone register their own domain name and use it to create your own email address and universal login system. 
There are plenty of alternatives to Google and Facebook's universal login that you can run from your own website, such as Mozilla Persona and OpenID. 
The problem has always been that setting up a server to run all this stuff is too technical for the average user. 
Indie Hosters tries to solve this by setting all this up for you on a server managed by someone who understands all this technical stuff, but who won't lock you in. 
Most web hosts already offer some sort of one-click installer to help you setup popular tools like WordPress. 
But Indie Hosters is trying to take this a step further by automating absolutely everything you need to manage your identity online. 
Instead of confusing users by making core features optional, all accounts will come with both a your own top-level domain, custom email forwarding based on that domain, and a TLS certificate -- the same standard that banks and retailers use to protect your credit card transactions online. 
And web identity software such as OpenID and Mozilla Persona will soon work right out of the box. 
At the same time, Indie Hosters will let you publish and build your own stuff on the web. 
At the moment, it offers only two publishing tools to start: the popular blogging system WordPress and a new, social-media-aware tool called Known. 
But de Jong says Indie Hosters will offer far more applications in coming months, ranging from personal cloud storage systems like OwnCloud to the Bitcoin-style application development system Ethereum. 
Traditional hosting services don't usually add new apps to their one-click installer packages until they 've become popular. 
That creates a paradox for new applications looking to gain traction among the non-geek set. 
de Jong hopes Indie Hosters can give these new applications a better chance of succeeding. 
De Jong and Ozoux aren't the only ones trying to make running a personal web server easier. 
The creators of Indie Box and Freedom Box hope to sell you a physical server that you can run from home, so that you don't have to trust any cloud provider. 
Meanwhile, Sandstorm, managed by ex-Googler Kenton Varda, is aiming to create a brand new open source web hosting platform that makes it far easier to manage servers in the cloud. 
Indie Hosters is focused on helping you own your identity, while Sandstorm is more about getting applications up and running quickly. 
To sign-up for Sandstorm, you need to use either a Google Account or GitHub account. 
Varda says that will change eventually, but the two projects clearly have different priorities. 
While Sandstorm is trying to build a new platform that makes managing servers much easier, de Jong says that he and Ozoux are trying to avoid writing any new software at all. 
Instead, they're trying to use the best software already available and writing automation scripts to manage everything. 
Varda says that although Sandstorm has more apps available on its platform now, the Indie Hosters approach will probably enable them to add new apps more quickly than Sandstorm can, since most apps need to be tweaked to run on Sandstorm. 
In the long run Sandstorm will offer a more transformative change in the way we run servers, Varda says. 
But the beauty of open source is that Indie Hosters can use Sandstorm's tools to improve its own offering. 
Then everybody wins. 
Scientists make this season's flu vaccine based on the strains of the virus that circulated during the last flu season. 
It's a flawed approach, but it's the best they can do given that it takes months to make the vaccine, and there's no way -- at least not yet -- to predict how the virus might evolve in the interim. 
But a new computer modeling study suggests the human immune system has a better memory than scientists had thought for strains of the flu it's encountered in the past. 
In the future, the researchers say, it might be possible to exploit this to design better vaccines. 
Every year, the flu wreaks havoc around the world. 
It typically infects millions of people around the world every year and kills up to 500,000 in a typical year. 
National economies lose billions of dollars to medical care and missed workdays. 
The flu vaccine helps soften the blow, but vaccine makers are in an arms race with the virus. 
The Global Influenza Surveillance Network orchestrated by the World Health Organization continuously collects samples from ill people all over the globe and in February each year chooses which strains to put in the vaccine. 
Months later, around November, people start rolling up their sleeves to receive a vaccine based on those one or two strains. 
But sometimes the virus mutates during the lag time between spring and fall, which renders the vaccine less effective. 
Smith thinks we can improve the vaccine, even if we can't accurately predict the flu's evolution yet. 
His new study published in Science today offers a new way to look at our immune system's reaction to influenza. 
The team tracked 64 people in Vietnam for six years, analyzing their antibodies -- proteins made by the immune system to flag invading pathogens for destruction -- when they were infected with the flu. 
They then created 3-D antibody landscape maps of each person's immune response, says research assistant and co-author Sam Wilks. 
In the figure above, the colored dots represent different strains of flu, and the space between the dots reflect structural differences between those viruses. 
The 3-D landscape blue shows the individual's varied immune response to all the strains peaks indicate high immunity, valleys indicate low immunity. 
The landscapes revealed something remarkable: when influenza infects someone, it not only triggers an immune response for that particular strain, but for all the strains of that type of flu that have ever infected the person. 
This phenomenon, named ` back-boosting,' means that our old immunity gets boosted every time we're faced with a new flu virus. 
Typically, the back boost response was stronger for past strains that were closely related to the infecting strain. 
The researchers think we make antibodies for past strains because our immune system's memories of past viruses are activated more easily than they'd thought. 
The findings suggest that the flu vaccine provides much more protection than anyone thought against past versions of the flu that have infected a person. 
Someone infected with the flu last year will still make antibodies for that strain, regardless of what version of the vaccine they receive. 
It's essentially a free pass, Smith said. 
This means scientists can try to predict how the virus might mutate an active area of research and base a vaccine on that, without worrying about diminishing protection against current circulating strains. 
If last year's strain is still around this flu season, a vaccine targeted for a novel strain will still offer a defense by stirring antibody production. 
This opens up the possibility for vaccinating against a future virus, explains Smith, We don't have anything to lose because it won't make the vaccine any worse. 
The back boost covers our backs. 
Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm agrees. 
This is potentially revolutionary work, says Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease and Research Policy at the University of Minnesota, We're a long way from changing our current policies, but this could really help. 
It also raises questions about how often do we need to be vaccinated if we can use this back-boost? 
It 'll be a while before a vaccine that takes advantage of the back-boost goes into a shot or nasal spray -- the approach still needs to go through clinical trials, which Smith hopes to get started on within a couple years. 
Until then, he recommends you get your flu shot anyway. 
Game of Thrones is coming. 
No, not the HBO show -- you still have to wait till 2015 for that -- but rather the highly anticipated videogame coming from Telltale Games. 
The first chapter of the game's six episodes is due out before the end of the year for PC, Mac, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and iOS. 
Today, we 've finally got our first look at the trailer, whose narrator sounds very much like actor Lena Headey. 
It also features some familiar faces: Cersei, Tyrion, Margaery Tyrell, Ramsay Bolton, and a guy getting tortured by Ramsay who may or may not be Theon. 
Originating from a minor house in the Vale, Maester Ortengryn studied at the Citadel in the hope of being assigned to the Eyrie. 
But by the time he'd earned enough links on his chain to graduate from acolyte, Jon Arryn had been murdered and the South was in turmoil. 
The Citadel ultimately assigned Maester Ortengryn to Ironrath, where he soon came to respect the Forrester family's honor and integrity. 
He now serves the Forresters with pride and has become a trusted advisor to the Lord. 
Built over fifteen hundred years ago by Cedric Forrester and his triplet sons, Ironrath is a testament to the strength and endurance of Ironwood. 
The Forrester house words are ` Iron from Ice', which echoes their belief that -- like the ironwood itself -- the adverse conditions and unforgiving landscape of the North only makes them stronger. 
The Forresters have come up in the books before though not the TV show, thanks to a passing mention in A Dance with Dragons. 
They're bannermen to House Glover of Deepwood Motte, and have long been loyal to the Starks, though we're told little beyond that. 
Ironrath is located in the Wolfswood, a massive forest that sprawls across the northwest of the North. 
It's also conveniently located on the edge of the largest ironwood forest in Westeros, giving the Forresters control of a valuable resource often used build weapons and ships. 
Fun fact: When Ned Stark beheaded that guy in the beginning of Game of Thrones, it was on an ironwood stump! 
We're told that their good fortune has attracted the particular jealousy of their sure-to-be-evil rivals known as House Whitehill. 
Indeed, the trailer involves some ominous threats from Cersei, who mentions how important the ironwood is to the Forresters and suggests that it would be a shame to let it fall into the hands of another house. 
I imagine you'd do anything to prevent that from happening, wouldn't you? 
According to Telltale, unspecified events -- likely relating to Cersei's threats -- will put House Forrester into a precarious position that could spell their doom. 
And perhaps ... send a protagonist on an exciting journey to achieve a thing? 
Throughout the course of the game, you 'll actually get to play as five different members of House Forrester -- either blood relatives or those serving them -- across both Westeros and the eastern continent of Essos. 
The qualification that not all playable characters are actual members of the family suggests that Maester Ortengryn may indeed be one of them, since he was merely assigned to the House by the Citadel, and not born into it. 
A previous teaser for the game included a quote from Storm of Swords mentioning squids in the Wolfswood and flayed men -LSB- riding -RSB- the Kingsroad, a reference to the Greyjoys and the Boltons in the North. 
The third season of the television show ends with Roose Bolton named Warden in the North, so chances are the Forresters will be asked to swear fealty to House Bolton -- and the man widely known to have betrayed and killed Robb Stark, their former lord. 
The Greyjoy angle is a little more uncertain, since Yara's doomed invasion to rescue Theon didn't take her anywhere near the Wolfswood the Bolton Dreadfort is located in the East though the Ironborn could still factor in in one way or another. 
Since the end of the fourth season also sees the arrival of Stannis Baratheon at the Wall, he -- and dare we hope, the Battle for Castle Black? 
-- could easily play a role in this Northern drama as well. 
What's the sound of a spacecraft landing? 
It used to be a source of fun speculation, but now we know for sure. 
Instruments recorded the thump of Philae's first of three landings on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko last week. 
The SESAME-CASSE instrument, which includes sensors on the bottom of the lander's feet, recorded vibrations felt when Philae first bounced off the comet's surface. 
What you hear is the actual sound of the landing. 
Sounds can't travel through the vacuum of space, because there are no air molecules to vibrate. 
But sound can move through solid objects like the leg of a spacecraft, which is what Philae recorded. 
The sounds reveal that the lander first touched down on a hard, icy surface covered by a softer layer several centimeters thick that is probably dust. 
As for where Philae is now, the team is still figuring it out. 
Preliminary data suggests that the little spacecraft is sitting on a lot of water ice. 
This week, China hosted its first World Internet Conference in Wuzhen. 
The irony of a country with some of the strictest online censorship laws in the world holding an event with the theme interconnected world, shared and governed by all was underscored yesterday, when the events' organizers made a pro-forma attempt to get attendees to approve a draft declaration by slipping it under their hotel room doors late at night. 
TechCrunch has obtained a copy of the document, which is supposed to represent the consensus views of conference participants. 
A PDF is embedded at the bottom of this post. 
Our source says that the draft was put under hotel room doors around 11PM, giving attendees until only 8AM the next morning to make revisions before it is released at tonight's closing ceremony. 
Furthermore, many attendees had already checked out last night since the conference's main events took place on Wednesday and Thursday. 
The World Internet Conference, which started on Wednesday and ends today, was organized by the State Internet Information Office SIIO. 
The SIIO was set up in 2011 to coordinate various agencies after then-president Hu Jintao called for the government to ramp up its oversight of online content and activity. 
Participants in the Conference acknowledge that the Internet is increasingly becoming a leading force of innovation-driven development and is powering economic and social progress. 
The Internet has turned the world into a global village and made the international community a highly interdependent community of common destiny. 
While enjoying rapid development, the Internet has posed new challenges to national sovereignty, security and development interests, which requires the international community to meet urgently and seriously expand consensus and strengthen cooperation. 
It then went on to list nine suggestions. 
The most ridiculous and mealy-mouthed are below. 
This item is especially ridiculous considering China's well-documented history of launching cyberattacks against international media outlets, military, and government organizations. 
The director of the U.S. National Security Agency admittedly not itself a glowing example of good behavior, Admiral Mike Rogers, recently said that China, along with probably one or two other countries, has the power to possibly shutdown the U.S.'s Internet infrastructure, including the computer systems of public utilities, aviation networks, and financial companies. 
Media outlets China has spied on recently include the New York Times and Next Media. 
Next Media, one of Hong Kong's largest media companies, has long been a target of the Chinese government, but attacks on its computer systems have increased since the start of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which Next Media founder Jimmy Lai has openly supported. 
China has arguably used terrorism prevention as an excuse to exercise even tighter control on its residents' access to online information and services. 
For example, in August the Chinese government blocked several messaging apps, including Line, KakaoTalk, Talkbox, Vower, and Didi, claiming that the services were being used to spread terrorism-related information. 
But Line's blockage may have in fact have been triggered by the pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong. 
As Qiao Mu, a professor journalism at Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Financial Times: This alleged link between terrorism and these messaging apps is pretty far-fetched. 
On the whole, it sounds like they are using antiterrorism as an excuse to ban foreign apps, which are harder for the government to control. 
It's not just foreign Internet services and apps being targeted under the guise of counter-terrorism. 
The Chinese government also launched a campaign against popular microblogging platform Weibo formerly Sina Weibo last year, citing similar reasons. 
Last year, Weibo's user base fell 9 percent to 280.8 million from 308.6 million the year before. 
This is partly because many users are shifting to more private messaging apps like Tencent's WeChat, but also because of stricter laws like one that threatens social media users with three years in jail if a message that the government deems to be an online rumor is shared more than 500 times or seen by more than 5,000 users. 
China's regulations against online pornography have been particularly severe. 
In 2009, more than 15,000 sites with pornographic content were shutdown. 
The crackdown intensified this year. 
In the spring, China's internet regulator launched a sweep called the Clean Internet Campaign that included the closure of three online literature sites that it claimed it hosted obscene content. 
Penalties for posting pornographic content online for profit include sentences of up to three years in jail. 
This isn't just about the healthy growth of young people. 
Anti-pornography laws make it even harder to share information on the Internet by giving the Chinese government more leeway in the kinds of sites it is allowed to target and shutdown. 
The Clean Internet Campaign came soon after the banning of messaging apps mentioned above, as well as the Weibo crackdown. 
The country's Land Transport Authority LTA today outlined a framework to safeguard commuter safety and interests in response to the rapid rise of apps like Uber, Hailo, GrabTaxi and Rocket Internet-backed Easy Taxi. 
The organization expects the regulations to be effective within the first half of next year. 
Singapore may be a relatively small country with a population of around five million, but there are nearly 30,000 registered taxi cabs and car ownership is expensive. 
In a recent interview, Hailo's Ron Zeghibe told TechCrunch that it was pretty clear that taxi apps have taken off in the country. 
The proposed framework isn't likely to cause much chaos for these companies. 
They will be required to register with the TLA, and provide the cost of fares upfront, which they already do. 
They must also offer basic customer support services, and all drivers should hold Taxi Driver's Vocational Licences. 
That's another thing each company already adheres to, even drivers of UberX -- the ride-sharing service -- are commercially licensed in Singapore. 
The logic here is that this information can affect the likelihood of a driver deciding to make a collection. 
If they know you want to travel through an area with heavy traffic or your journey is far then they may choose to ignore your request, for example. 
While the taxi industry has shared that knowing prospective passengers' destinations can encourage drivers to accept bookings, there are concerns that some taxi drivers may choose their passengers and avoid taking bookings to certain destinations. 
LTA has thus decided that it should be left to commuters to decide if they want to provide this information. 
Uber and Hailo adhere to this, but GrabTaxi and Easy Taxi may need to adjust their apps in response -- neither company provided comment to TechCrunch at the time of writing. 
Uber and GrabTaxi both released positive statements when contacted. 
Looking to get away? 
Maybe you should just add a trip to your Wish List in the hope someone buys it for you. 
At least, that's what you might be able to do soon, if reports of Amazon branching out into travel are accurate. 
The travel news site Skift reports that Amazon has been working with independent hotels and resorts near major cities to kickstart a new Travel department. 
The report claims that the new service could launch as soon as January 1st 2015, initially providing hotel options around New York, Los Angeles and Seattle. 
The model sounds pretty simple: hotels would list rooms, availability, pricing, and photos into on Amazon, then pay 15% commission to Bezos & Co. on any bookings. 
Hoteliers tell Skift that Amazon has been approaching them to join the scheme over the past weeks, using TripAdvisor ratings to target the best places to get on board. 
The report suggests that the initial focus of Amazon Travel would be on places to stay rather than transport, though the offering will be rounded out with editorial about attractions and other things to do in the destination. 
It sound much like Amazon's other early-stage dabbling, which start small in an attempt to see if they're viable at scale. 
Obviously, it's tough to say how accurate this report is. 
But with Amazon increasingly looking to provide services for every facade of your life, it's certainly believable. 
Let's wait see.

This marks the second time the Bills will play at Ford Field this season following a 17-14 win over the Lions on Oct. 5. 
It also is the second time in four years the facility has hosted a neutral site game. 
The last time an NFL game was moved to Ford Field unexpectedly, the fans who did show up witnessed a bit of history. 
Brett Favre's streak of 297 regular-season starts came to an end that night - on Dec. 13, 2010 - when the Minnesota Vikings lost to the New York Giants 21-3. 
Favre was sidelined by shoulder and hand issues. 
That game was moved to Detroit because the Metrodome roof collapsed. 
A brain area that recognizes faces remains functional even in people who have been blind since birth, researchers say. 
The finding, presented at the Society for Neuroscience Meeting this week, suggests that facial recognition is so important that evolution has hardwired it into the human brain. 
It's all inborn, says Josef Rauschecker, a professor of neuroscience at Georgetown University Medical Center. 
The structures are all there because nature has put them there. 
First, the scientists had Gerrard learn to use a special headset fitted with a small camera. 
By moving her head, Gerrard could make the camera scan across a drawing. 
Blind volunteers used a headset fitted with a small camera to scan various shapes, and listened to a mix of corresponding sounds. 
Gradually, they learned to associate a specific pattern of sound interplay with a specific contour. 
The square in the center represents the camera's field of view. 
So, what you are seeing and hearing is a line moving across the camera's field of view, first from bottom to top and then from left to right. 
The device produced sounds. 
And as lines or curves came into the camera's view, those sounds would change. 
The concept is a bit like tapping your way along a wall to find a stud behind the plaster. 
With practice, Gerrard was able to interpret more complex sound patterns that revealed more complicated shapes. 
Eventually, I could identify a face by listening to those sounds, Gerrard says. 
To find out how Gerrard was doing this, the Georgetown scientists put her in a brain scanner. 
The idea was to watch Gerrard's brain while she was using sounds to recognize a simplified drawing of a face, says Paula Plaza, who was in charge of the experiment. 
Our interest was looking into the brain, she says. 
What part of the brain is responsible for this perception? 
The team compared brain scans from the six blind people with the scans from 10 sighted people who were looking at the face drawings with their own eyes. 
The results were almost identical. 
In both groups, the image caused lots of activity in the left fusiform face area, a region of the brain that always lights up when you see a face, Rauschecker says. 
In sighted people, the fusiform face area is connected to the brain's visual system, he says. 
But in blind people it appears to be wired to circuits that process sounds. 
So there is substantial reorganization in the brain of the blind, Rauschecker says. 
What's remarkable is that despite this reorganization, the brain of a blind person retains the module devoted to facial recognition, Rauschecker says. 
That strongly suggests that the ability to recognize faces comes more from nature than nurture, he says. 
It came from Justin Lucas, the head of NPR's Audience and Community Relations team. 
He's the go-to person here for requests from listeners, for information or permissions. 
Justin read me an excerpt of the request: I'd love to make and sell Mama Stamberg's Cranberry Chutney. 
A portion of the proceeds ... 
Wait, she says chutney? 
I ask. 
Fair point, says Lucas. 
Anyway, a portion of the proceeds will go to either NPR or our local NPR station. 
Please let me know the terms under which you would allow this. 
Thank you very much. 
Anyway, Justin says, I'm the one to give permission. 
So I call her. 
Hansen tells me there are lots of NPR listeners in Delmarva where Delaware, Maryland and Virginia make a pretty peninsula who are curious about the recipe, but don't want to actually make it. 
She figures if she makes it, they 'll want to try it. 
So can we do it? 
she asks. 
Well, I say, I'm kinda picky about that recipe. 
I mean, Americans can make it when I do it on the radio, but ... you're not very far from where I am in Washington, D.C. I think I'd need to come and inspect your sandwich shop and see the kind of operation you 've got. 
That would be fabulous! 
says Beth. 
You were asking what our terms might be, I say. 
You know we have no terms, to tell you the truth, Miss Hansen. 
But this inspection will be very important -- just to make sure it's the proper venue. 
It turned out it was the weekend of the Waterfowl Festival in Easton, a lively celebration of hunting season in Delmarva. 
But the only geese we see in town are carved in plastic, and bleep from a boombox, hidden behind some bales of hay. 
Now, like you, I have attitudes about hunting. 
And guns. 
I like big dogs and decoys and not great paintings of ducks and geese and sunny streets full of families and food stalls. 
There are lots of eating areas all around with tables and chairs. 
At 9 a.m., there's quite a line at the all-you-can-eat $ 7 breakfast buffet. 
Delmarva native Mark Weaver is fixing himself a plate. 
I started with the potatoes. 
You got ta have your starch. 
And then my scrapple. 
Then, after that, we're gon na get a little bit of bacon, he says. 
I 'll grab a biscuit and I 'll make a little biscuits and gravy. 
At this point I am in need of Beth Hansen's Soup and Salad. 
Where is she? 
I stroll the aisles, searching. 
And there's the food stand. 
Beth is tall and smiling, gray hair, and friendly, if a bit nervous. 
Her soup looks good: We have potato leek, vegetable beef, crab and chicken noodle. 
It smells great and the salad fixings are so fresh they sparkle. 
Beth opens a container. 
OK, this is the big moment, she says, Are we worthy? 
It's a little pale, I say. 
It's supposed to be more of a Pepto Bismol color. 
She hands me a spoon. 
Slowly and carefully I take a taste. 
This is perfect, I say. 
She gasps. 
It could use a little more horseradish, but who am I to quibble. 
Another bite, a grin, and Beth Hansen gets the Stamberg Family Seal of Approval. 
The latest public awareness campaign from the White House focuses on bystanders. 
A slick new PSA urges students to step in when they see a someone who may be in trouble. 
It follows other efforts aimed at would-be-perpetrators, making sure they understand what counts as consent. 
That's not society I wan na live in, where I have to look out for what I wear. 
I think that's a basic human right, she says. 
And we don't tell men to not get blackout drunk. 
But, Sayre says, not warning women feels wrong, too. 
Her mom warned her. 
Grad student Brendon Smith, who signed the bystander pledge, says it's not an either/or question. 
Of course, students should take precautions, he says. 
As one law enforcement official put it, you wouldn't park your Lexus with the windows open and leave jewelry on the front seat. 
That would be foolish. 
People don't like to hear that. 
Like, if I tell my friend like, ` Oh, I think you are drinking too much, like you should probably slow down,' I might get some crap for it, but I think it's a risk you have to take. 
I mean, they possibly could be a victim of some kind of assault, he says. 
When I saw it, I was like ` What the hell does that mean?' 
It was very shocking, says LaChrista Greco, a survivor and activist who works on campus. 
I was like, ` This is super victim blaming.' 
People can not prevent their own rapes. 
Recently Ramapo College in New Jersey also came under fire after students were warned that their body language and facial expressions could also invite assault. 
Officials say the comments were misinterpreted and that violence is always the perpetrator's fault, but they're reviewing their program. 
Likewise, at the University of Wisconsin, police spokesman Marc Lovicott says officers will now choose their words more carefully. 
The university police's safety tips were updated, and the wolves reference was removed. 
Man, it just seems like we live in such a politically correct society these days and everybody's watching the words they use and they should be, I mean, to a certain extent. 
But when it comes to crime prevention we're not gon na stop, Lovicott says. 
Campuses have an obligation, Lovicott says, to advise students how to stay safe. 
And that's not victim blaming, because there are predators out there who are looking for individuals that may seem more of a target than others, he says. 
But how do you say that in a way that you're not offending a victim who went through this horrible crime? 
This is the third rail. 
It really is, says University of Virginia law professor Anne Coughlin. 
She says she, too, has learned to hold back on what she calls commonsense advice. 
Yes, I 've experienced the blowback, and it's touchy, she says. 
But, she says, it's also understandable. 
Going back to that analogy of leaving your Lexus open with jewelry in the back seat -- police might call that a dumb move. 
But if your stuff was taken, they'd also call it a crime, and go after the thief. 
Rape cases, Coughlin says, have always been different. 
Up until very, very recently, there was no crime. 
If the woman is drunk ... she's intoxicated, it must mean she's consenting, she wasn't raped. 
That's not victim blaming, that's saying you weren't even a victim, she says. 
Indeed, as White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett puts it, no matter what happens leading up to the crime, it's still a crime. 
Warning potential victims should be part of the solution, she says, but only part. 
Yes, throughout life everybody has to do what they can to protect themselves. 
Certainly one has personal responsibility, but in so many of these instances women are doing everything right, but yet they're still being sexually assaulted, Jarrett says. 
What's encouraging, Jarrett says, is that people are now talking about it more. 
Years ago, she says, she never warned her daughter about sexual assault, but she says, she's glad that moms today are. 
We listen to our own voice when we talk -- it helps us monitor what we're saying. 
But simultaneous interpreters have to translate one language into another in real time, so they learn to ignore themselves. 
In the 1990s Franco Fabbro and colleagues at the University of Trieste in Italy asked students to recite the days of the week and the months of the year in reverse order while listening to themselves through headphones. 
First they heard themselves with no delay. 
Then they repeated the exercise with delayed feedback of 150, 200 and 250 milliseconds. 
Half the students were untrained in translation and made errors. 
The other half of the group were in their third or fourth year at the university's School of Translators and Interpreters, and these students suffered no significant disruption. 
Quick! 
If you had to guess what an iPad Air 2 decked out in 24K gold looked like, what would you say? 
If your answer was ridiculously kitschy -- congratulations! 
You're correct. 
We'd also accept kind of like grandpa's wristwatch 
It used to be that scientists all agreed that it was impossible to achieve temperatures below absolute zero, but now they realise that's not entirely true. 
This video explains how you can reach temperatures below absolute zero. 
The phenomenon is made possible by playing with entropy and energy, to change the way groups of particles behave. 
But better to watch the video than have me explain. 
We still not entirely sure what to do with the finding, though.

Music while you shop? 
Two prominent startups in India have teamed up to push their respective causes and raise awareness of two nascent industries that could explode as smartphone adoption in the country grows. 
Streaming service Saavn today announced a partnership with online retail giant Snapdeal. 
The first fruit of the coming-together sees customers who shops at the e-commerce site using an Android device given two months of free access to Saavn's premium, ad-free music service. 
Snapdeal may be India's e-commerce underdog, since it competes with minted rivals Amazon and Flipkart, though it recently raised a whopping $ 627 million round of its own. 
Android accounts for as many as 90 percent of smartphones in India, and it almost certainly makes up a huge chunk of Snapdeal's revenue -- the company says 70 percent of its orders come from all types of smartphones and tablets, and it expects that figure to reach 90 percent within two years. 
Saavn's position isn't that much different. 
It also competes with strong rivals and in an industry that could take off as India's population buys increasing numbers of mobile devices. 
The company offers millions of Indian music and international tracks in a similar manner to Spotify. 
It released a Pro version of its service last year, allowing users to pay 220 INR $ 3.60 for ad-free listening and access to tracks offline -- it also offers cheaper ` lite' plans. 
The startup, which is headquartered in New York with offices in India, recently raised undisclosed funding and reshuffled its leadership team, as it prepared to up the ante and compete with Rdio -- which snapped up Indian startup Dhingana -- and local rival Gaana.com, a service from Indian media firm Times Internet, for the attention of the public. 
This partnership with Saavn is in response to this growing penchant for mobile shopping amongst our customers. 
We want to encourage that trend by providing easy access to what they love most -- a truly high quality, uninterrupted music experience, commented Kunal Bahl, co-Founder and CEO of Snapdeal. 
The giveaway is effective today. 
Shoppers who buy from Snapdeal's mobile site using an Android device will receive a notification that contains a Saavn Pro promotion code and a prompt to get the Saavn Android app. 
Once they download it and redeem that code, they 'll have access to the Pro service for two months. 
Some caveats apply though. 
Saavn tells us that its partnership with Snapdeal will run for a year, and could include different offers from time to time. 
This particular deal will last for at least one month -- possibly three months, we hear -- but each user can only redeem one promotion code -- so repeat shopping on Android devices doesn't mean repeat free trials of Saavn Pro. 
But for real, the kind of horrifying, fleshy-lookin' 3D printed shape you see below is quite literally bananas. 
Pureed bananas, mixed with a bit o' potato starch for the sake of holding things together. 
As the latest experiment by the guys over at 3digitalcooks a blog that focuses heavily on 3d printing with food stuffs like chocolate, or potatoes, or, as in this case, bananas, it's ... still a bit of a work in progress. 
It's pretty darn neat, in theory, it's just not very ... you know, appetizing. 
PFT, DETAILS. 
Next step: figure out how to make it not immediately turn brown. 
Their best guess there is to use some kind of ascorbic acid. 
We surveyed people on whether or not they'd care if their 3D printed banana food was brown, and 100% of respondents said What the hell is 3d printed banana food? 
which I'm taking as a yes. 
America has the Tesla electric car, Britain has ... a poop bus. 
Bristol Airport now has a bus that will shuttle people to Bath city centre, powered solely by human and food waste. 
To be specific, it's the biomethane gas produced by the anaerobic digestion treatment of said waste that the bus runs on. 
Anaerobic digestion sees oxygen starved bacteria breaking down biodegradable materials, with methane-rich gas a by product of the process. 
The 40 seater can travel 186 miles on a single tank, which is the equivalent of five people's annual waste. 
The gas is stored in dome-like tanks on the bus's roof, with the vehicle emitting 30 per cent less carbon dioxide compared to a conventional diesel engine. 
Gas-powered vehicles have an important role to play in improving air quality in UK cities but the Bio-Bus goes further than that and is actually powered by people living in the local area, including quite possibly those on the bus itself, said Mohammed Saddiq, general manager at GENeco, the Wessex Water subsidiary whose Avonmouth sewage works provides the biomethane gas that powers the bus.

Did you ever play Maniac Mansion? 
Of course you did. 
Because if you hadn't, the geek police a real thing would have already taken away your geek card also real. 
Like pretty much anything Lucasfilm Games RIP released throughout the 80s and 90s, Maniac Mansion is just one of those games you have to play. 
Seriously, go bootleg it if you have to. 
Maniac Mansion creators Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick are back with a spiritual successor to Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island, and the many such LucasArts games of yesteryear: Thimbleweed Park. 
The wonderfully clunky interface? 
The oh-so-pixely pixel art? 
It's all there. 
As The Wall Street Journal reports, four of the men are Yemeni and that is important because they are the first Yemeni prisoners to be transferred since 2010. 
The paper explains: 
The U.S. banned transfers of Yemeni detainees to Yemen after Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian man, attempted to blow up an airliner on Christmas Day 2009 with an underwear bomb made by a Yemen-based terror group. 
Yemeni detainees are the largest group in Guantanamo, and transferring those detainees from the prison remains an obstacle to closing it, according to human rights advocates. 
There now are 143 men held at Guantanamo, including 84 Yemen nationals, according to the Pentagon. 
Of the Yemenis held at the prison, 54 are eligible to be transferred from Guantanamo and have been cleared for release, the Pentagon said. 
A number of resettlements are expected in the coming weeks. 
U.S. State Department envoy Clifford Sloan has been trying to persuade countries to accept prisoners, and he praised Georgia and Slovakia. 
` We are very grateful to our partners for these generous humanitarian gestures,' Sloan said. 
` We appreciate the strong support we are receiving from our friends and allies around the globe.' 
Georgia took three prisoners from Guantanamo in 2010. 
Slovakia has taken a total of eight men from Guantanamo. 
Lousy days happen to all of us. 
Even a seemingly harmless wake-up-on-the-wrong-side-of-the-bed morning can send you into a funk. 
No matter how many happiness hacks or positive mantras you try to make it better, it can be hard to shake your grouchiness and glass-half-empty attitude. 
And when a bad mood follows you to work, it can amplify all sorts of everyday annoyances and frustrations. 
Now, perhaps you're not able to hold it together in front of your boss when she criticizes your report. 
Or you're more prone to raise your voice at the intern when he makes copies in black and white instead of color like you asked. 
And you make absent-minded mistakes, like distractedly sending the wrong version of a document to a client. 
While none of these are career-ending mistakes, their effects can leave you feeling down on yourself for days. 
Whatever the situation, you know you need to turn it around as soon as possible. 
But pause your catastrophic thinking, and take a moment to identify the emotions behind those thoughts. 
Are you angry with a client? 
Disappointed with yourself? 
It may sound simple, but applying a label to the emotion you're experiencing can discharge its hold on you and equip you to overcome the negative feelings. 
When you're flustered, your mind is cluttered, but research shows that putting your feelings into words can put the brakes on your emotional response and help you process the situation from a more rational, calm perspective. 
A thought becomes simply a thought ; an emotion just an emotion. 
For example, I keep messing up at work, and I'm so frustrated with myself becomes I'm having the thought that I'm not doing enough at work, and I'm feeling frustration because of it. 
This mindfulness practice has been shown to improve behavior and problem solving. 
When you're having a bad day, your decision-making skills are hijacked, so avoid rash action. 
Read: Don't hit happy hour to drink your bad day away or delete the gigantic PowerPoint that's been the source of your frustration. 
Instead, allow yourself a set amount of time to wallow, be angry, or be sad, and then move on. 
For example, give yourself the morning to emotionally work through whatever is gnawing at your last nerve, but commit to coming back strong after lunch. 
If you can't turn it around that quickly, listen to the advice sleep on it. 
Sometimes, choosing to end one day and start fresh the next is the most powerful cure for a bad day. 
When you're having a bad day, it's easy to self-sabotage -- like wallowing alone. 
But resist the urge to isolate. 
We all have that one buddy who puts a smile on our face, no matter what, so see if you can arrange a quick coffee date with this person -- or, if he or she lives far away, send an email or text. 
Reaching out to a friend and finding empathy in his or her response can have a comforting effect and help you feel accepted bad days, grouchy moods, and all. 
Plus, it can be a great opportunity to ask for advice or a second opinion if you're facing a thorny situation at work. 
If you don't feel like explaining the situation to a friend, try reading PostSecret or your favorite blog. 
Even those virtual connections can help you feel understood and reminds you that you're not alone -- other people go through similar things every day. 
Need ideas? 
Offer to mentor an a new intern at the office, help an elderly person in your building carry heavy bags, or finally donate to the charity you 've been thinking about getting involved with. 
Not only will you be helping someone else, but you 'll be able to take the focus off of yourself, which can put your bad day in perspective. 
In fact, having this kind of giving attitude is key to being successful. 
Generosity helps elevate your reputation to multiply other people's successes, making you indispensable, management expert Adam Grant explains. 
So, find ways to help your co-workers, put more effort into answering emails, and, in general, make yourself a resource to others. 
In theory, treating yourself sounds nice after a day when nothing's gone right, but it's actually the worst time to indulge. 
When your judgement is compromised, you could end up overdoing it, whether that means eating a few too many sweet treats or buying a $ 300 pair of shoes that definitely aren't in your budget. 
In the moment, it may make you feel great -- but when it's time to pay your credit card bill, you 'll likely be overcome by guilt and end up feeling even worse. 
We 've all heard the old saying that it's not how many times you fall down, it's that you find the strength to get back up. 
When you find yourself in a deep funk, keep in mind that horrible days happen to everyone -- and they don't make you any less valuable of a person or employee. 
A little perspective, along with these tips, can help you bounce back next time one of those days happens to you.

Aereo, the streaming TV service that let users watch near-live TV on any internet-connected device, has today announced that the company is filing for Chapter 11 reorganization in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. 
The company has appointed Lawton Bloom, from Argus, to serve as Chief Restructuring Officer during the gradual shut down process. 
Aereo launched back in 2012 with a plan to change the way we watch television. 
The New York City-based company offered technology that lets users rent, on a subscription basis, access to a micro antenna small enough to fit on the tip of your finger. 
The antennas were stored remotely in one of Aereo's antenna farms, placed close enough to various broadcast towers to pull in those signals. 
Aereo users could then choose between any of those publicly available, free OTA signals to choose a channel. 
The Aereo technology lets the user immediately start recording as soon as they tuned to a channel, which allowed for a similar experience to watching live TV, as recordings could be played back as soon as they began. 
Because of this, Aereo was able to offer access to 30 different television channels, including the big broadcast networks like Fox, ABC, NBC, and CBS, for as low as $ 8/month. 
In fact, an Aereo user with a borrowed HBO Go subscription, a Hulu Plus Account, or Netflix, really has no need for cable television. 
So not surprisingly, these broadcast networks took Aereo to the mat, in various markets, in an attempt to plug the leak. 
It didn't take too long after Aereo's launch for the broadcast networks to band together and file a lawsuit in New York City, Aereo's home market. 
But this was expected. 
In fact, the company was prepared with around $ 25 million in funding from Barry Diller and others. 
Aereo's operational costs, even with scalability and marketing costs, don't require that much capital. 
That was war money. 
The broadcasters argued that Aereo was illegally retransmitting their copyrighted work, alleging violation of the Copyright Act. 
Aereo, on the other hand, argued that Cloud DVR storage and using an antenna to pull free OTA signals down to your device are both legal activities. 
Combining them, according to Aereo, holds up under an earlier precedent set by Cablevision. 
See, Cablevision came under fire a few years ago for transforming their DVR service to a cloud-based storage system as opposed to on-deck storage. 
The company came out victorious, arguing that the individual copies of content being viewed by DVR users were still individual, unique, and private copies that were owned by the user, and that they do not constitute public performances. 
Aereo's technology was actually built with the express intent to fall within this precedent. 
Like a Cablevision cloud DVR system, Aereo users are the ones who choose to tune to a channel, record, and watch. 
This is an integral piece of information when it comes to proving a private performance vs. a public performance, which was a main issue in the case. 
But that was far from the end. 
Aereo raised more money, and defended itself against more fire. 
Similar lawsuits were filed in Boston and Utah against Aereo, slowly but surely draining the startup of resources as it fought multiple battles in different regions. 
In Boston, Aereo held up in court yet again, but Salt Lake City proved difficult, with a federal judge shutting down the service in that market. 
And so, in December of 2013, both parties decided that the never-ending lawsuit was a waste of time, petitioning to put the case before the Supreme Court. 
At the time, Aereo had more wins under its belt than losses, and a win in the Supreme Court would solve the biggest and most financially draining problems plaguing the startup since inception. 
Ever since, Aereo has been looking for ways to keep the dream alive. 
The company even tried to petition to be classified as a cable company, given that its perception as one was the reason for its shuttering. 
But the Copyright Office denied the request. 
And so, almost three years later, we 've reached the end of the road. 
And it should light a fire under the ass of the tech industry, especially for those interested in disrupting the current cable television model. 
The system has been corrupted. 
Companies like NBC, Fox, ABC and CBS get the spectrum they use to broadcast to us for a ridiculously low price from the government, with the express promise to offer a public information service to Americans for free, in return. 
But since the cable companies and media companies have consolidated powers, transforming into a powerful oligopoly, free broadcast television is bundled for a price into your cable package. 
Of course, you could go buy a pair of rabbit ears, cut the cord, and call it a day. 
But it's 2014, and for all intents and purposes, Aereo is the modern-day set of rabbit ears. 
Personally, I find it a shame that the Supreme Court couldn't see that. 
Big engines like the 707-horsepower monster Dodge put in the Challenger Hellcat or Volvo's little four-cylinder that makes 425 ponies get all the attention these days. 
But there are millions of tiny engines doing tiny things think garden trimmers, leaf blowers, that sort of thing that we never give much thought to. 
But just as there are engineers pondering how to make big engines more powerful, so too are there engineers pondering how to make tiny engines more powerful. 
Some of those engineers work at the engine development firm LiquidPiston, which has created a 70cc pistonless rotary engine that it expects to produce five horsepower at an astounding 15,000 RPM -- in a package 30 percent smaller than a similar piston engines. 
Now, five horsepower doesn't sound like a lot, but it's more than adequate for the applications such an engine might be used in. 
And further refinement of the prototype could, of course, bring more power. 
LiquidPiston calls the new engine the X Mini. 
It can run on diesel fuel or spark-fired gasoline like the engine in your car. 
Because so many potential applications are in the lawn care and landscaping biz, the current design runs on a mix of gasoline and oil for lubrication. 
The engine is similar to the Wankel engine Mazda used for years in the RX-series sports car. 
It has just two moving parts: a rotor and a shaft to transfer power from the engine. 
Minimal moving parts means the engine is smaller, lighter, more reliable and quieter than a conventional piston-fired engine. 
It's also smoother, which, if you 've ever used a weed whacker or leaf blower, you 'll consider a big plus. 
So what's a pistonless rotary engine, you ask? 
In a conventional four-stroke reciprocating piston engine, the piston moves within a cylinder. 
Air and fuel are drawn in with a downstroke and compressed in an upstroke. 
The mixture is detonated as the piston reaches the top of the cylinder ; the explosion forces the piston down, creating power. 
Exhaust gasses are expelled on the following upstroke, and the process begins anew. 
A Wankel pistonless rotary engine has a rotor that looks like a rounded triangle, a shape called an epitrochoid. 
It rotates in an eccentric orbit within an oval chamber ; each rotation results in three power strokes. 
The big advantage of a pistonless rotary engine is its high power to weight ratio, reduced weight, and simplicity. 
LiquidPiston riffed on the Wankel design and uses an oval rotor that spins within an epitrochoid chamber. 
The company claims its design -- one of 60 it says it has patented -- improves upon the Wankel to create a more durable engine. 
The engine, which is 95 percent aluminum, uses a pair of counterbalancers to minimize vibration. 
LiquidPiston claims it is two orders of magnitude smoother than a conventional engine. 
Such an engine could see use in everything from scooters to drones, but LiquidPiston is focusing on the lawn and garden market -- even if it has no plans to actually build engines. 
We're not looking to manufacture engines, says company president Alexander Shkolnik. 
Instead, the company plans to continue developing the engine and work with a manufacturing partner to tailor it to a particular application, perhaps a chain saw or leaf blower. 
Shkolnik presented a paper on the new engine this week at the SAE/JSAE 2014 Small Engine Technology Conference & Exhibition in Italy. 
Next year, the company plans a contest to solicit ideas for how the engine might best be used. 
A lot of the major risks have been addressed, Shkolnik says. 
Now it's all about optimization and calibration.

An orange remote-controlled dog, called FIDO, failed to scare geese away from an amphitheater in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 
FIDO was the centerpiece of an elaborate goose-deterrence strategy deployed by the city parks department which, one official explained, would teach geese that the amphitheater was not a good place to be, because that orange thing will chase us. 
However, the official explained, What we found is, that didn't really happen. 
The city was now considering identifying people who go walking near the amphitheater for exercise and recruiting them to physically chase -LSB- the geese -RSB- and run them off.

The statistics are staggering: Researchers predict that by 2025, the world will have 37 megacities, defined as urban areas with more than 10 million people. 
New York City and Newark are expected to have more than 23 million inhabitants ; Tokyo, more than 38 million people. 
All told, well over half of the world's population will be living in these super settlements. 
One number that isn't referenced often is that two-thirds of that population will be poor, says Pedro Gadanho, who curated Uneven Growth: Tactical Urbanisms for Growing Megacities at MoMA. 
That poverty translates into informal cities, like the favelas of Rio de Janeiro or illegally subdivided high-rises of Hong Kong. 
What Gadanho, and MoMA, want to explore is: How can urban planners work with these urban residents, not against them, to make cities more livable for everyone? 
There are myriad factors to consider: When rising tides encroach on millions of residences, will those families lose their homes? 
If many of the 8 billion people in the world don't have access to proper healthcare, how can architects promote healthy living environments? 
Gadanho invited six teams of architects, urban planners, and researchers to propose tactical urbanisms, or urban planning solutions that draw on existing and not always legal infrastructure and patterns in human settlement. 
Each team spent 14 months on scenarios for one of six cities: New York, Rio de Janeiro, Mumbai, Lagos, Hong Kong, and Istanbul. 
Each city is growing rapidly, and each has tremendous inequality. 
The teams were selected based on their work and methodology. 
I cherry picked practices that were already on the terrain, doing their own take on the idea of tactical urbanism. 
So they were already working with committees, researching how people were appropriating space, and proposing models for a different kind of city, Gadanho says. 
Many of these proposals are based on the idea that top-down planning has been failing people in many aspects. 
In scale and ambition, the results run the gamut. 
For instance, 85 percent of Hong Kong is surrounded by water, yet the city's population is expected swell by 50 percent. 
MAP Office, Hong Kong Network Architecture Lab, and New York's Columbia University reasoned that with so little land, the city has three options: develop sanctioned natural parks, extended the shoreline further into the water, or building artificial islands near the coastline. 
They ultimately proposed building eight new islands, each dedicated to an economic or social activity unique to Hong Kong, like fishing. 
Naturally, building these would create jobs. 
In Istanbul, housing development in the 1970s led to a city where the middle class mostly inhabits TOKI buildings, or clusters of towers in gated communities. 
For the people of Istanbul, acquiring a TOKI apartment is part of a middle class dream, one that also includes owning a car, and the latest gadgets. 
As Superpool and Istanbul Atelier d’Architecture Autogérée see it, that consumer-driven culture could soon become a society in debt. 
They propose a new kind of utopia, where the TOKI clusters get retrofitted with micro-farms, solar panels, and shared car services. 
Called R-Urban, the services would be open-source and connected through a series of apps. 
It builds a sharing economy layer on top of the TOKI clusters, which reinforces, rather than destroys, the sense of community that drew inhabitants there in the first place. 
After 14 months of gestation, each project is still highly hypothetical and probably only viable under a certain set of circumstances, like municipal cooperation, or the availability of funds for construction. 
They're all pie-in-the-sky utopian ideals. 
In that light, the exhibit is a mental exercise, one that considers how to build according to what people are already doing. 
Governments might want to eradicate favela housing, because they can't control it, but that improvisational style of living exists in part because of the skills and community values that already live in a city. 
That's an opportunity, not an obstacle. 
Great looking hardware. 
Snappy processor and plenty of RAM make the Z3 a speed demon. 
Shoots 4K video. 
Waterproof up to 5 feet.

Mystifying software choices, including pointless redesigns of great stock Android apps. 
Sony has an Android problem. 
For years now the consumer electronics giant has been making some truly head-turning hardware loaded with Google's mobile OS. 
When it comes to actually using the hardware, though, things almost always go south. 
It seems Sony just can't help itself from making the same mistakes over and over. 
The Xperia Z3 is its latest almost-great phone. 
On paper, the it looks like a gem. 
You 've got a 5.2-inch 1080p display 424 ppi, a 20.7-megapixel camera capable of shooting 4K video, Qualcomm's super-quick 2.5 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor, not two but three gigabytes of RAM, a 3100mAh battery, dual front-facing speakers, and sure, what the hell, let's make it waterproof to a depth of 5 feet for up to half an hour, too. 
There aren't many phones out there with a rap sheet as bad as that. 
With the screen off, it looks like a polished black slab -- both front and back. 
Around the sides is a solid, gently rounded aluminum chassis. 
Up top is a headphone jack yes, it's waterproof. 
On the right-hand side, you 'll find the door covering the micro SD card slot, the silver power button, the volume rocker, and lastly, the physical shutter button for the camera. 
All phones should have a physical shutter button. 
When it comes to speed, you won't have any complaints. 
Sony went through a long phase where it used great processors, but bad software slowed everything down. 
That seems to be one thing they 've solved because this thing absolutely screams. 
I don't see any hesitation while flipping between home screens, app and folders fly open, and everything seems to move as fast as your finger. 
As for sights and sounds, the screen is very bright and I almost never had any difficulty reading it outdoors. 
The colors are rich, too. 
The Z3 doesn't have those super inky blacks that we love on AMOLED displays, though, and at times it looks a bit gray and flat. 
I was excited about the dual front-facing speakers a la the HTC One M8, but while they're fairly loud and nice for gaming, they're not very clear. 
Music sounds distorted and unbalanced, and things can be grating at full volume. 
In contrast, both the HTC One M8 and the new Moto X which only has one true front-facing speaker are louder and better sounding. 
The camera is finicky too. 
Sometimes, when there's enough light, it produces rich, vivid, and sharp photos that absolutely make you salivate. 
Two seconds later, you can take almost the exact same shot, and it 'll be washed out with bland colors. 
The camera app isn't particularly user-friendly, either. 
Settings seem to be placed at random within the menu, and you can't access most of them until you change out of auto mode. 
Speaking of camera modes, there are over a dozen, although they take the form of camera apps. 
That's where you 'll find useful things like 4K video stashed among other generally useless apps like AR Fun, which overlays dinosaurs and elves onto whatever you're pointing your camera at. 
Battery life is generally solid, too. 
Sony claims that it has two day battery life. 
I definitely never saw it get anywhere close to that the most I ever got was 30 hours, but I'm a heavy user. 
I will say that most of the time made it well past bedtime without needing a charge, except for when it didn't. 
And here's where things started getting weird. 
It seems that there's got to be a runaway bit of code somewhere in the device, but I have no idea what triggers it. 
There are days where it seems this phone will never run out of batteries, and then there are days when I notice the phone is running hot and I find myself looking for a charger before 6pm. 
As far as I can tell, I'm using the phone roughly the same amount, so something must be wrong in there. 
Ultimately, even though the software doesn't cause many slowdowns, it's still what keeps this from being a great phone. 
When you compare the UI i.e. the skin Sony puts on top of Android to the minimal UI that Motorola is using, or to stock Android, it looks like a convoluted mess. 
For proof, just look at my notification panel. 
All of those are from pre-installed software that came with this phone. 
Do you see what's not there? 
My actual notifications, like for email and text messages. 
I had to scroll down to find them. 
Even when there are fewer things on there, it's still tough to find what you're looking for because it gets so cluttered. 
The apps Sony decides for some reason to redo on their own -- like the very good stock Android Calendar -- universally get worse as well. 
This is true for the dialer, where the UI has no sense of flow, and the app drawer, where they add a layers of complication to something as simple as adding an app to your desktop. 
It seems Sony has too much ego caught up in the game and just can't get out of its own way. 
There are stability issues, too. 
I got an error message after I hadn't been using my phone, pulled it out, and took five photos. 
I also get a lot of apps randomly crashing. 
Sometimes, everything you open instantly crashes, and you have to restart the phone. 
It's these layers of annoyance and complication that make it very hard to recommend the Z3 to John and Jane Q Public. 
So once again we're left with an all too familiar story. 
The Z3 is ostensibly a phone with a lot going for it. 
It's a phone I actually really want to love. 
But once again, the flaws are simply too sizable and numerous to recommend it in good conscience. 
Here's to hoping that story will finally change next time. 
Walking into the new Hunger Games movie, it's easy to feel a sense of anticipatory disappointment. 
Thanks to the many times we 've seen one book split into two films -- it was vaguely annoying for Twilight, it 'll be downright intolerable by the final Divergent movie -- we're conditioned to think of the Part 1 ″ of any series as the appetizer, the cinematic amuse-bouche you have to watch before waiting another year for the main course. 
It's very unsatisfying. 
Mockingjay -- Part 1 is no different, with one big exception: It leaves you craving more, instead of feeling unfulfilled. 
A lot of this is thanks to the fact that third installment in the franchise is set in an almost entirely different world than the two films before it. 
The Hunger Games and Catching Fire both put teenage hero Katniss Everdeen the perpetually movie-saving Jennifer Lawrence in an arena fighting other teens for survival. 
In Mockingjay she's been rescued from the frying pan and thrown into the fire, joining the civil war her acts in the Hunger Games inspired. 
It's like Che Guevara in reverse: She was the face of the movement before she joined the revolution. 
Setting up this new battle means there's a lot of explaining to do -- and while thanks to quick direction from Francis Lawrence it all gets done in a clean two hours, here's the even shorter version: After being extracted from the last Hunger Games at the end of Catching Fire, Katniss has been taken to the rebellion's underground bunker in District 13, a concrete and iron structure bathed in sci-fi grey. 
The former Head Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, to whom the film is dedicated has convinced President Alma Coin the chillingly believable Julianne Moore that Katniss should be the symbol of the revolution, the star of a televised propaganda campaign to unite the people against the totalitarian Capitol. 
After a few humorous missteps -- the rare levity in a very somber movie provides -- Katniss' plane-shooting, rally-crying face is jamming airwaves and causing revolts throughout her home country of Panem. 
And thank god that face is Lawrence's. 
Yes, she's one of our best working actresses and the No. 1 Realness Keeper of American cinema, but her skill lies in being able to take a fairly unlikeable, moody character and make her believable. 
There's probably no other actress under 25 who could spend nearly two-thirds of a film in a state of shocked open-mouth crying and still be fascinating. 
Katniss Everdeen may start revolutions, but Jennifer Lawrence could make peaceniks take up arms. 
Being surrounded by the likes of Hoffman, Moore, Woody Harrelson as the newly-sober Haymitch, Jeffrey Wright tech whiz Beetee, and Game of Thrones badass Natalie Dormer as Katniss' documentarian Cressida, doesn't hurt either. 
It also demonstrates how much more of a crap actors -- and Lionsgate, which hired them -- seem to give about this dystopian franchise than nearly any other one currently running. 
The other Lawrence's performance ain't so bad, either. 
Francis took over directing duties on the saga on Catching Fire and managed to give that movie much more weight and bravado than its predecessor no disrespect to Garry Marshall. 
He does even more of that here, broadening the story beyond Katniss, whose POV is all we get in the books, and giving Mockingjay more heft than we get out of a lot of its YA counterparts. 
Seriously, what other made-for-teens movie series touch on totalitarianism, social upheaval, and/or prisoner torture? 
And while it might be overstating to call these movies important in the Hurt Locker sense of the word, they can have an impact, especially for young women. 
Surprisingly, though, the increased scope doesn't mean the script from Peter Craig and Danny Strong the writer of HBO's Game Change who also played the annoying Danny Siegel on Mad Men has to stretch too much in order to pad out what was in Suzanne Collins' Mockingjay novel. 
Scenes that were only alluded to in the book -- Panem rebellions and the ensuing public executions -- get screen-time and there are more scenes with President Snow played by Donald Sutherland and his caterpillar eyebrows, but other than that it's almost note-for-note from Collins' story. 
There is one fantastic exception to this source-material loyalty: Effie Trinket. 
In the book, Katniss' glamour team from the Hunger Games was taken from the Capitol by the District 13 rebels to work on her Mockingjay looks. 
Here, it's just Effie, played to perfection by Elizabeth Banks. 
In a movie light on LoLs, she shows up looking like Madonna circa her pseudo-revolutionary phase and gets to say things like, you 'll be the best dressed rebel in history. 
Suck it, everyone in a Guy Fawkes mask. 
It's everything. 
And even while Effie is turned up, the story's love triangle is blessedly turned down. 
In District 13, Katniss is with Gale walking jawline and serviceable actor Liam Hemsworth while Peeta affable humanoid Josh Hutcherson is being held captive by the Capitol. 
Gale manages to show his requisite bits of jealousy, but for the most part Katniss' feelings towards either of them are limited to her worry about what horrors Peeta is enduring at the hands of his captors. 
That is, until the end. 
We won't spoil it here -- especially since the reveal of where the filmmakers broke up the novel is about the only surprise the book's fans are going to get -- but those worried the movie would simply stop, rather than have a proper ending, will be relieved. 
It isn't as gripping as what's likely to come in Part 2, but Mockingjay -- Part 1 does come with a proper coda/cliffhanger. 
It's not a cold adrenaline rush to the heart, but it also doesn't feel forced or flaccid. 
Mockingjay isn't perfect. 
But for a movie that could 've come out looking like the franchise family's awkward middle child, it's incredibly mature. 
And, perhaps more importantly, it doesn't feel like it was made just so a studio could raise venture-capital levels of money at the box office, even though they probably will. 
There's action, a smart script, and nearly two solid hours of Jennifer Lawrence. 
And no one walking into this movie expects much more than that. 
In 16th century Scotland, the alchemist John Damian, who was known to expense a suspicious amount of whiskey in his experiments to find the elusive philosopher's stone, decided he could fly. 
He fashioned a pair of wings from feathers and took off from the lofty battlements of Stirling Castle for a flight to Paris. 
He didn't make it to France, but he did plummet a few feet away from the castle and break a leg. 
The failure, he later claimed, was due to using feathers from chickens, which can't so much fly, when he should have used eagle feathers instead. 
Really, the problem had more to do with mammals like us not being cut out for flight. 
Well, except for bats. 
There are, though, critters like sugar gliders and flying squirrels, which can pull off some pretty solid glides. 
But compared to the adorable and little-known colugo, they got nothin'. 
This is the most accomplished mammalian glider of all -- on account of being essentially a giant flap of skin -- capable of soaring an incredible 200 feet from tree to tree. 
Its expansive membrane, known as a patagium, stretches from its face to the tips of its digits all the way back to its tail, so geometrically, it has the greatest surface area that you can have between those limbs without actually evolving an entire wing like bats did, said conservation biologist Jan Janecka of Duquesne University. 
With such a beautifully evolved body, the colugo, also known misleadingly as a flying lemur more on that later, spends its nights leisurely gliding through the forests of Southeast Asia. 
Their skeletons, while not nearly as frail as those of bats, are thinner and more elongated than that of a squirrel, reducing their weight while increasing their surface area. 
And their huge eyes, Janecka says, gives them not only good night vision, but excellent depth perception -- no insignificant advantage when you're coming in for a hard landing on the trunk of a tree. 
Colugos are such adept gliders that mothers have no problem bringing their babies along for the ride. 
And they 'll do so for quite some time, for their young are born highly underdeveloped. 
They're not as helpless as, say, marsupial young ` uns, which enjoy the comfort of their mother's pouch, but certainly not as developed as most mammals. 
Still, the newborns cling to mom as she sails around the rainforest in search of food, mostly sap and leaves and shoots. 
And as if the colugo's flappy skin weren't bizarre enough, its teeth are shaped like little combs. 
This could be helping them in some way to feed, says Janecka, or may play a part in grooming to snag parasites on their skin. 
That's right. 
Colugos may be brushing their hair with combs built right into their faces. 
Unfortunately, beyond watching mothers sail around with their babies, we don't know much at all about the colugo's social life. 
And efforts to keep them in captivity have largely been for naught. 
Remember that these are creatures used to gliding up to 200 feet, and good luck finding that kind of space in a zoo. 
Basically their enclosures weren't large enough to allow them to glide long distances, said Janecka. 
And because they couldn't glide, they couldn't keep their patagium well maintained and dry enough. 
They developed infections on their skin, perhaps from a fungus, and died. 
Ironically enough, it's too much space in the wild that's threatening some colugo populations. 
Deforestation can strand species in islands of trees, but even if loggers just thin out spots in the forest, it's big trouble for the colugo. 
They're the most accomplished mammalian glider on Earth, sure, but if there's too much space between trees, the colugo runs the risk of sinking right to the ground. 
And as you can see below in the video from National Geographic they strapped a camera to a colugo -- enough said, the creature's extra skin makes it all but worthless when anywhere but the canopy. 
It's an easy target in a habitat packed with predators. 
Because colugos tend to live in isolated habitats and because they insist on emerging only at night, much of what we know about them comes from anecdotal evidence. 
Case in point: colugo doo-doo. 
It ... moves. 
I 've seen some videos of fecal material that they 've dropped where there's so many worms it's actually moving, said Janecka. 
It's squirming around. 
The colugo digestive tract, it seems, has a really, really high parasite load. 
And that whole dynamic, whether it happened to be in a population that has a lot of parasites or it's something that's more normal for the colugos that they 've learned to deal with, that's one of those unknown questions at this point. 
What is abundantly clear is that the colugo has a very long digestive tract, which makes sense for a creature that eats trees. 
That stuff takes a whole lot of time to digest. 
But such long guts could also be acting as a sort of mansions for parasitic worms, which have lots of room to make themselves comfortable. 
Until someone starts studying colugo turds at length, though, we 'll have to leave this one a mystery. 
But thanks to Janecka and his colleagues, we're now confident of this: Colugos are primates' closest living relatives. 
So although flying lemur is a misnomer, both because colugos aren't flying but gliding and they're not a kind of lemur, the name isn't that far off. 
Because they have these adaptations for gliding, originally people sort of threw them in with bats, Janecka said. 
But when they looked at the actual morphology of the skull, there was evidence that they're closely related to primates. 
When Janecka and his colleagues did a genomic analysis of the colugo, this suspicion was confirmed. 
It turns out that around 90 million years ago, at the height of the dinosaurs' reign when mammals were just tiny furballs scurrying about trying not to get stepped on, the colugo's ancestors split off from our primate lineage. 
Some 25 million years later, the dinosaurs' time came to an end, leading to the explosion of mammalian diversity. 
In fairness, though, it's the arthropods and bacteria who really rule the world, not us mammals. 
But they can't do cool things like glide 200 feet or comb themselves with their teeth ... or drop poop that moves on its own.

While we had significant victories in the federal district courts in New York and Boston and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the reversal of the Second Circuit decision in June by the U.S. Supreme Court has proven difficult to overcome. 
The U.S. Supreme Court decision effectively changed the laws that had governed Aereo's technology, creating regulatory and legal uncertainty. 
And while our team has focused its energies on exploring every path forward available to us, without that clarity, the challenges have proven too difficult to overcome. 
It's sad that what promised to be a consumer-friendly and generally pretty terrific service has been driven into the ground by regulation, but then that's the way laws work. 
So long, Aereo: it was great while it lasted.

In order to strengthen your mind and build mental toughness, you need to work it the same way you would work your muscles in the gym. 
This mental workout helps you refocus and visualize success in tough times, and only takes 100 seconds of your day to complete. 
Jason Selk is a performance coach that has worked with Olympians and professional athletes in almost every sport there is. 
During his time with Major League Baseball's St. Louis Cardinals, Selk's job was to train the team mentally. 
Over at Inc., Selk explains the mental exercise he had them do helped them earn two World Series championships, and you can easily do it on your own: 
When you find yourself in tough times, use this exercise to conquer your mental state. 
With enough time and practice, you can train yourself to do this type of quick meditation automatically, increasing your mental toughness. 
You are capable of getting through the hard times, and you are capable of doing what needs to be done, but you have to believe it first. 
The U.S. Supreme Court decision effectively changed the laws that had governed Aereo's technology, creating regulatory and legal uncertainty, the company's founder and CEO Chet Kanojia said in a statement. 
And while our team has focused its energies on exploring every path forward available to us, without that clarity, the challenges have proven too difficult to overcome. 
We have traveled a long and challenging road, Kanojia said. 
We stayed true to our mission and we believe that we have played a significant part in pushing the conversation forward, helping force positive change in the industry for consumers.

Amazon has been gaining ground on Netflix in the streaming market in the U.S., and now it is planning a video service that could see it overtake its rival. 
According to a report in the New York Post, the e-commerce giant is planning a free video service that will be supported by advertising. 
This would sit alongside -- not replace -- the company's existing video offering that is bundled into its $ 99/year Prime membership. 
Does this sound familiar? 
It should. 
In March, the WSJ had a similar report of an ad-supported video service. 
But at the time the company flat-out denied that this was happening. 
The NYP report notes that the ad-based service is a definite go although it not specify a launch date. 
The WSJ wrote that the service would be turned on in the coming months. 
We have reached out to Amazon for a comment for this story or another denial. 
We will update when and if we hear more. 
But in the meantime there are a lot of reasons why it would make sense for Amazon to launch an ad-supported video service: 
The Amazon Media Group, as the company's effort is called, already sells advertising across a range of Amazon properties -- Amazon.com, Quidsy, Imdb.com planting seeds for film and video-related ads? 
, and photography site DPReview. 
It also runs mobile ads and ads specifically for Amazon's Kindle devices. 
Currently, the company only lists one video format in its list of ad units. 
That is for an in-stream video, which it only serves on non-Amazon sites, and only in the U.S. and Canada. 
While Google's YouTube has built its audience on ad-supported free video, it also has paid channels and is now launching a paid subscription for music videos, Music Key. 
While Yahoo has long been working on ways to have a to more comprehensive video play in the form of content, it's also been beefing up in video ads, recently acquiring BrightRoll. 
Amazon Instant Video is now the second largest paid streaming video service in North America, accounting for 2.6% of downstream traffic, Sandvine notes. 
It's also seeing the most growth, with traffic more than doubling in the last 18 months. 
One of the perks of becoming a grownup is you no longer have an imposed bed time. 
It still might not hurt to schedule one for yourself if you want to keep your sleep cycle steady, though. 
As business blog Inc. suggests, sleep is an appointment just like any other. 
You need to make time for it, and there are consequences if you don't. 
Because sleep won't fire us if we miss a meeting, we tend to think it's less important to put it in the calendar. 
However, we schedule what's important to us. 
And sleep is incredibly important: 
Sleep deprivation drastically impairs our judgment. 
You are more likely to achieve success and health with a regular and generous sleep schedule.Treat your bedtime like an appointment, with the same urgency and importance that you give your work-repeated appointments. 
Determine what time you need to get up and count the hours backwards to allow for the seven or eight hours of sleep your body needs. 
Like a flight or important meeting, your sleep should be thought of as the fixed point of your day -- everything else should be adjusted as needed. 
Not only will having sleep in your calendar remind you that you need to do it, it also forces you to move it out of the way if you need to schedule something else. 
Friends want you to go to a party at 10PM on a Tuesday? 
When you enter that into your calendar, you see exactly how much sleep you're going to have to pay for it. 
If President Obama acts in defiance of the people and imposes his will on the country, Congress will act, said Mitch McConnell, soon to be the majority leader in the Senate. 
We're considering a variety of options. 
But make no mistake. 
Make no mistake. 
When the newly elected representatives of the people take their seats, they will act. 
The variety of options McConnell mentioned was left unspecified. 
But through all the angry rhetoric the target was not so much the new policy -- or its practical effects -- as the manner by which the president made the change. 
Obama did it on his own. 
He did not wait for Congress as he said many times he had to do. 
More to the point he did not wait for the new Republican majorities elected this month to arrive in power. 
In truth, the unilateral action makes a much better villain than the hopes and aspirations of immigrant families. 
The substance of Obama's policy shift, the deferring of deportation and allowance of some work permits so as to keep families intact, polls remarkably well. 
So the mantra for opponents this week was consistent: The president's actions were illegal, unlawful, even unconstitutional. 
Some said the president was provoking a constitutional crisis. 
At the Republican Governors Association meeting in Florida, potential presidential contenders vied to be the most outraged. 
But here too, the focus was less on the policy than on the unilateral process. 
And the predominant remedy was to go to court. 
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, about to leave office, said he might sue or leave that to his successor, Republican Greg Abbott. 
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, just re-elected, also said he was looking to the courts to smack the president down. 
Turning to the judiciary does seem appealing. 
If the president is out of line, the courts should say so. 
This strategy also has the virtue of moving the onus away from the elected officials themselves and onto another branch of government entirely -- one the elected folks can not entirely control. 
That way, if the courts fail to do as desired, well, then that's on the courts. 
Speaker Boehner had previously warned Obama that executive action on this issue was playing with matches. 
He said it could be added to the list of offenses for which the House is already suing the president. 
But the House lawsuit, authorized months ago when Boehner needed a gesture to placate his rank and file, has yet to be formally filed. 
Two law firms that had been retained in the matter are no longer involved. 
The House has now turned to law professor and media commentator Jonathan Turley to handle its case, and perhaps the immigration action will add fresh impetus as well. 
It is easy to find people who think the courts will stand aside on this one, or even rule in favor of the White House. 
But in any event, the legal system does not dispose of big matters overnight, and the president's new policy will be changing the facts on the ground very soon. 
So many opponents would prefer something more immediate and visible to demonstrate the sincerity of their resistance. 
Influential organizations such as Heritage Action and Americans for Limited Government have called for immediate action to frustrate the president's plans, fastening on the spending bill Congress was poised to pass in December to fund the government through next September. 
This omnibus appropriation has been favored by McConnell and his counterpart, House Speaker John Boehner, who want to end the short-term spending bills and fiscal cliffs that have complicated everyone's life these past four years. 
They want to show that the new GOP majority can return the fiscal ship of state to an even keel. 
But even if McConnell and Boehner shake their heads no, that December spending deadline still looks like a lovely opportunity to some of the president's antagonists. 
Why give away the leverage that spending bills give you every time they expire? 
Many on the right are even willing to risk another government shutdown, like the one in October 2013, or earlier episodes in 1995 and 1996. 
The conventional wisdom has been that those battles ended badly for Republicans in Congress, who relented in the end to Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and saw their party's approval rating slump in the polls. 
But right now, in the glow of their Nov. 4 triumphs in Congress and most statehouses, many Republicans are wondering whether shutdowns were really so bad for their brand. 
Sure, there was a short-term downturn in the Gallup, but what does that matter if you win the next actual election? 
These hardliners also know the previous shutdown struggles have focused on the inconvenience they caused the citizenry, or on the petulant behavior of some congressional leaders see the coverage Speaker Newt Gingrich got during the 1995 shutdown. 
Would the outcome be more favorable to the GOP if the government shut down to prevent the overreaching of a president -- especially one who's down in the polls himself and just lost a midterm election?

As the year wraps up, it's time to start thinking about deadlines -- and there are a handful of financial deadlines to meet by the end of the year. 
Here are a few money moves you should make before the new year. 
As we explained in our 401 k primer, the amount you save in your account is tax-deferred. 
This means whatever savings you make into the account you can deduct from your taxable income. 
You have until December 31 to contribute to your 401 k or 403 b. 
So if you want to reduce your taxable income in April, you should make those contributions now. 
The 2014 401 k contribution limit is $ 17,500, or $ 23,000 if you're 50 or older. 
The Traditional IRA is also tax-deferred, but you have until April 15 to contribute to your IRA. 
The limit is $ 5,500 for 2014 $ 6,500 if you're age 50 or older. 
Donating to charity is just a nice thing to do. 
But if you want to reap the tax benefits, you 'll want to do it soon. 
Any charitable contributions you make before December 31st will be tax deductible for your 2014 taxes. 
So donate your old clothes. 
Support your local indie radio station. 
Give to a nonprofit. 
And if you want to use your donation to reduce your tax bill, make sure to get receipts and keep records. 
Flexible Spending Accounts FSAs let you save pre-tax dollars for qualifying medical expenses. 
During open enrollment, you decide how much of each paycheck you want to save in the account. 
Like a 401 k, you can deduct the savings from your taxable income. 
Unlike a 401 k, if you don't use that money by the end of the year, you lose it well, some of it. 
IRS rules allow employers to carry over $ 500 of your money into the next year. 
Or, they can give you a grace period. 
Either way, many people find themselves having to spend their FSA money before the end of the year. 
And it's not always as easy as it sounds, because you can only spend it on qualifying medical expenses. 
I wrote about FSA end-of-year spending a while back at Bargaineering. 
Here are some suggestions on how to spend that money: 
Of course, you can also use the money on doctor's visits and more obvious medical expenses. 
Check out the full post for more suggestions. 
1099s are the most common example. 
If you hired a contractor or a subcontractor and paid them more than $ 600, you're required to send out 1099s. 
And you have to fill and mail them out before Jan 31st, so you should order them soon. 
Getting a big tax refund sounds like a good thing. 
But really, it's not. 
It means you're giving the IRS too much during the year. 
That money could be better used to pay down high interest debt. 
Or, you could save it and earn a little interest. 
Either way: ideally, you want to pay just the right amount of taxes during the year. 
No more, no less. 
If you expect you 'll pay too much or too little in taxes come April, you can fill out a new W-4 with your employer before the end of the year. 
Saving to Invest suggests doing this especially if you have other variable income: 
If you're self-employed and you pay quarterly estimated taxes, you 'll make your final payment for 2014 in January. 
Calculate how much you 've already paid, and how much you're expected to owe, then pay accordingly. 
We 've talked about capital gains in our primer on investing and taxes. 
Basically, when you sell your assets and make a profit, you're taxed on that profit, which is called a capital gain. 
To offset the taxes on capital gains, some people use capital losses. 
They sell any assets that have plummeted, take the hit and report the loss on their taxes. 
This is called tax-loss harvesting. 
Investopedia offers an example: 
In some states, contributions made to a 529 college savings plan is also tax-deductible. 
Edward Jones explains that you have to file by December 31 to receive any state income tax deduction. 
There are a few exceptions. 
Georgia, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Oregon and South Carolina let you deduct contributions made up until their tax-filing deadline next year. 
You might qualify for tax breaks on certain payments. 
Make them early, and you can maximize your deductions in April. 
For example, if you qualify for the home mortgage interest deduction, you might consider making your January payment in December. 
Keep in mind, though, this only works with your January payment. 
Bankrate points out that your mortgage payments are made at the end of your occupancy period. 
They explain: 
They add that you also want to make sure you give that payment enough time to process. 
This way, the interest will show up on your annual statement in time. 
TurboTax points out that you can also do this with property tax payments and tuition. 
Check out their post for more detail on each of these. 
If you made any financial resolutions, now is obviously a good time to review them. 
But even if you didn't, you might consider reviewing your financial situation and making some goals for the new year. 
Take a look at your budget and your spending. 
We 've written about how you can reform your budget by organizing your focus on four areas: 
And our own Melanie Pinola has also written about the most common ways we waste money. 
Some of these money-wasters are easy to overlook. 
At the end of the year, review your annual spending and decide if there are any areas in which you'd like to cut back. 
Make or revisit any financial goals.

For years, software development has been driven mostly as a for-profit enterprise in which coders are hired to create applications for the organizations that employ them. 
That structure is usually a top-down exercise with a small number of people calling the shots and deciding what should get built and then assigning employees to build it. 
But now we 've reached a stage of history in which individuals have become more empowered to pursue projects on their own and with like-minded people. 
And as the cost of development has gone down, the amount of innovation has skyrocketed. 
Even so, there are still inefficiencies in this new model, most of which center around just how those like-minded people discover one another to begin with. 
Over the past year, Assembly has sought to solve those problems, by creating a platform upon which developers, designers, and engineers can come together to work on projects in an open, collaborative setting. 
As it seeks to grow, the company has raised $ 2.9 million in funding led by Union Square Ventures with participation from Thrive Capital, Box Group, Collaborative Fund, and a number of angels. 
Assembly has built a community for developers and designers in which they can collaboratively build and run various software projects together. 
Members share in the responsibilities and ownership of any given project they participate in, and stand to share in the benefits when a piece of software finds users and ends up being monetized. 
The platform works like this: First, a user submits an idea to Assembly and other community members can choose to rally around it and show support. 
Decisions about which features to add are done in a collaborative and transparent fashion, and bounties are set to determine how much value is assigned to any given task. 
When a task is done, the member who completed it receives a share of ownership in the project through the distribution of App Coins. 
Those App Coins are used by Assembly as a proprietary cryptocurrency to keep track of ownership for various projects. 
When a piece of software begins generating revenue, Assembly takes its cut and then passes on the rest, based on how much ownership each participating member has. 
All in all, it's a more egalitarian approach to making sure the folks who contribute the most to a project are those who are also paid when it comes to fruition. 
In the past year since launching the community, Assembly has seen five projects completed, which together have 4 million users between them. 
Two of those products are already profitable, and some community members are making more than $ 1,000 a month for their contributions to those projects. 
So far most of that work has been done during nights and weekends, or whenever participants have spare time. 
But the hope is that Assembly will enable those community members to eventually quit their day jobs and have the freedom and flexibility to work on Assembly projects full-time. 
Of course, to do that they will need to take on multiple tasks and projects. 
And on that note, there's a lot to choose from: There are now more than 50 projects in various stages of development, according to Assembly co-founder Matthew Deiters. 
And with new funding, Assembly will be able to support even more projects as it grows its team beyond the headcount of nine that it currently has.

I'm talking about disco -- what did you think I was talking about? 
-- but I'm also talking about the design that was created to sell this era of suddenly decadent lifestyles. 
The new book Disco: An Encyclopedic Guide to the Cover Art of Disco Records includes over 2000! 
album covers from the 70s and 80s, with at least 95 percent of them featuring scantily-clad and/or greased-up female body parts. 
There are interviews with musicians, designers and producers from the era, and the covers themselves include so many oh-so familiar names like Donna Summer, Chic, Gloria Gaynor, Grace Jones, Isaac Hayes, and Kool and the Gang, as well as hundreds of more obscure acts. 
With disco seeing somewhat of a resurgence -- have you heard Giorgio Moroder's new single? 
-- plus the Memphis-esque design of the era also having its own comeback, the art doesn't actually feel that visually dated anymore ; if anything, it will be inspiring to the current generation of designers. 
But if all this talk is making you nostalgic for the smell of moist Spandex and the glittery spray of a mirrorball, don't worry: There's a soundtrack to accompany the book as well.

So much so that it's only now, more than 31 years after Never Say Never Again hit theaters, that we finally have a wristwatch with a built-in laser powerful enough to do some damage. 
Created by Patrick Priebe who's well known for his creations that put coolness first and safety second, the carbon fiber-accented LaserWatch features an integrated 1,500-milliwatt blue laser that can be used for about five to ten minutes before the battery's dead. 
So it's best to save it until you find yourself in a real emergency. 
Priebe isn't releasing plans on how to build your own, but he is toying with the idea of producing a few and selling them to a handful of needy spies. 
At well north of $ 300 they 'll certainly be expensive for a device that does nothing but tell time and shoot lasers, but that's already twice as much as what a Rolex can do.

Whether you're an employer or just trying to wrangle people on a project, it's tempting to make things as simple as possible. 
As Netflix CEO Reed Hastings suggests, though, if you dummy-proof the process, you only get dummies to work there. 
Many folks prefer it when they have clear instructions to follow. 
That doesn't mean you have to hold their hands, though. 
By reducing work to a process that's so finely controlled that anyone can do it, you eliminate any creativity or alternative ideas that could make it better: 
People tend to think that they need a process for everything, and once in a while you hear ` We're going to dummy-proof it.' 
But if you dummy-proof the process, you only get dummies to work there,' Hastings says. 
That's why we're so opposed to that and focused on giving people great freedom. 
They 'll make mistakes, of course, but you 'll get a lot of great ideas. 
There's a different between being clear and concise, and simply holding people's hands. 
Remember, your coworkers or employees are people too. 
Allow them the freedom not only to change their processes, but to make mistakes. 
An interested worker is almost always better than a button pusher. 
There's no shortage of places to go online to search for local movie showtimes to get your cinema fix. 
But, arguably, when it comes to the way search results are displayed, the majority of sites and apps appear to take their UI inspiration from newspaper movie listings of yesteryear, employing a simple list view. 
Or so says U.K. startup MovieGlu. 
Founded by brothers Derek and Steve Morgan -- the former was previously a senior manager at Skype -- the web-based service lets you search for movie showtimes in the U.K. and U.S., based on location and time of day. 
However, its raison d’être is the way subsequent results are displayed, utilising a TV guide/EPG-style view that makes it easy to scan what movies are showing at cinemas near you and, crucially, at what time. 
Want to know which movie theatres near you are showing The Imitation Game as close to 9pm tonight? 
MovieGlu's timeline-based UI has you covered. 
Our competitors use a list-based format, inherited from the days of newspapers with film names and showtimes listed as text. 
MovieGlu is better because it displays search results in a TV-guide style format, which allows users to easily compare start and end times for every film, co-founder and CEO Derek Morgan tells me. 
Morgan counts those competitors as Fandango, IMDB, Flixster, Moviefone, and, of course Google. 
While there are already websites and apps that collate cinema listings, until now, no one has gone down the visual comparison route which makes it much easier to compare start and end times of films in one place,' he adds. 
Lacking for now, however, are native mobile apps, although we're told to expect an Android and iOS release in the coming months. 
That said, the MovieGlu site is fully responsive, so works well on both desktop and mobile web. 
In terms of business model, the startup currently earns affiliate revenue if you click through to a cinema's site and actually make a booking. 
Later we plan to create a white label service which can be licensed to related businesses such as film festivals, independent cinemas, and other business sectors which have similarly structured data, says Morgan. 
Remember the last time you went to the same coffee shop or bar because the staff tends to play music you like and you don't have to pick the next song? 
Prizm is a neat little pyramid add-on for your sound system to transform your living room into this coffee shop you like. 
The French startup is just beginning the last week of its Kickstarter campaign of its $ 129 smart music player for your home. 
If you want to use Prizm to play music, you just have to press the play button and that's it. 
Prizm will stream music directly from Spotify, Deezer and SoundCloud based on your favorite genres and tracks. 
You don't have to launch anything on your phone or computer. 
It's like a physical Pandora-like service for your home. 
The key advantage compared to existing solution is that Prizm is both instant and context-aware, co-founder Pierre Goch told me. 
Our device automates what every music service tries to do with their playlists -- ` Wake Up', ` Dinner Party', etc.. 
Behind the scene, Prizm detects who is in the room using the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals from your phone. 
If someone else is home as well, Prizm will adapt the track list to find songs that suit you both. 
You can like a track or skip it, making Prizm learn more about your tastes over time. 
And if you're sitting across the room, there will be an optional mobile app to control Prizm. 
Now, Prizm has some limitations as well. 
For example, you can't use Prizm to simply stream music to your stereo using AirPlay, Spotify Connect or Chromecast. 
For now, it's all about the hands-off listening experience. 
Goch told me that the team was considering adding AirPlay and Spotify Connect support. 
But there is one feature that I particularly like. 
Prizm will also listen to its environment to know if there are many people ready to party, or if it's a quiet dinner with a few friends. 
This way, it can play some music that will suit everyone's mood. 
Today in things Amazon might be working on: first, a travel site, and now, according to the New York Post, an ad-supported streaming video network. 
This has been previously rumored, but the Post is saying it's a done deal. 
The Post also says the service would operate separately from a $ 99 Prime subscription, be supported by ads and might undercut the cost of a Netflix subscription. 
While that estimation came from an analyst -- which means it is basically worthless -- it would make sense that a Netflix clone with ads would cost less than Netflix itself. 
As with many things Amazon does, this lower-level video subscription service would be used as bait to lure people to ultimately sign up for Prime. 
In other words, if you like Transparent, but you want to see it without blocks of ads interspersed, you'd have to pony up for Prime. 
Next step, profit. 
Considering Amazon has been throwing a lot of weight behind original programming as well as actively adding movies and TV shows you want to watch, this is something that sounds within the realm of possibility. 
The other part of the equation is what with HBO unbridling itself from cable subscriptions next year, Amazon might need a little more incentive to get people into its very own streaming service rather than looking elsewhere. 
We 'll see.

We often clutter our spaces with too much stuff: souvenirs, antiques from previous generations, and gifts are just the tip of the iceberg. 
If you're willing to put your feelings aside, here's how to objectively evaluate whether an item is worth keeping, or if you're keeping it for sentimental purposes. 
Just because an item is sentimental doesn't mean you have to throw it out, but it does mean you should be honest with yourself about why you're keeping it. 
There can be a few items that are worth their weight in happy memories or achievement. 
Trophies, keepsakes from family or late relatives, or just things that mean more to you than they're physically worth, for example. 
With that said, these questions help you take a more logical approach to your clutter. 
If an item has no value except sentimentality, it's up to you to decide whether it's worth keeping. 
If you're hanging on to a lot of items simply to preserve memories, try taking pictures instead. 
It's been a long week, and everyone is jonesing for that Thanksgiving break to put on their fattest pants and slip into football/food/movie comas. 
So we 'll keep it simple. 
Here's a GIF of Benedict Cumberbatch being flirty with you, and the week's most noteworthy television. 
I guess this would be the wrong time to ask you to marry me. 
But if not now, when? 
Jost/Jones has to be one of the best odd couples on TV. 
Not because they have especially good chemistry on camera, but because their anti-chemistry is so compelling. 
Leslie just walks all over him, but Colin is the perfect little milquetoast fall guy. 
There's a tiny hint of fear in his eyes each time they appear together at the Weekend Update desk, like he has no real idea how things will go down when Jones lets loose. 
But one thing is for sure: Upgrading her to full-fledged player is one of our favorite SNL casting decisions in a long time. 
Honestly, Jessica Chastain just seems like one of the sweetest, classiest people in Hollywood. 
And she's like best friends with her grandma, too. 
So here is Jessica Chastain being the loveliest person ever, if you're interested. 
Whether or not like you pop music, you must respect that Jessie J performs it very well. 
She's best known for her minor hits Domino and Price Tag from her debut album Who Are You, but that dropped all the way back in 2011, and it's only with her third studio release, Sweet Talker, that the British soul-pop firecracker has gotten substantial traction beyond people saying Oh, so that's not Katy Perry ?! 
No. 
It is not. 
Ms. J has been on the verge of breakout for years now, and we're hoping her phenomenal stage presence and killer voice are enough to make her a certified Top 40 sensation. 
She's earned a step out of the wings and into the spotlight. 
Here's a test: Just try and keep up with Russell Brand. 
We're on like our third watch and still missing jokes in the flurry of speech. 
Earlier this week we fantasized about being included in the Duplass family Thanksgiving, but Jamie Foxx's appearance on Kimmel made us reconsider our vote for Ultimate Turkey Day Gathering. 
Because really, it doesn't sound like he has enough houseguests already. 
We 've got ta give it up for One Direction. 
They 've managed to sustain a global obsession with their image despite having less charisma than the purple foam U in this video. 
Truly remarkable, gents. 
And is it just us, or does it seem like no one gave these guys a primer on what Sesame Street was before they shot this clip? 
` Cause they're acting a little like they're in front of some basement green screen and feeling pretty weirded out about the whole affair. 
Awwww, snap! 
You weren't supposed to see that, Oliver ... But more importantly, is that The Atom suit we just saw ?! 
Is this the most resource-intensive sketch ever to get cut for time ?! 
God? 
The fake Obamas? 
Real Edward Norton? 
A choreographed original song? 
Such an undertaking deserves a shout out. 
When Ayan Qureshi said goodbye to his dad and walked into a Birmingham, England conference center, he was just another five-year-old. 
But when we walked out, two hours later, he was something else: a five-year-old officially qualified to install and configure Microsoft's Windows operating system. 
Ayan Qureshi perhaps the youngest ever Microsoft Certified Professional. 
That means he knows how to do things like encrypt a removable drive using Microsoft's Bitlocker encryption software or troubleshoot Internet Explorer bugs. 
The 1990s-tinged certification test he took inside that conference center is still de rigeur for many corporate and government jobs. 
Microsoft calls these tests rigorous, industry-proven, and industry-recognized exams. 
But for Ayan -- who scored 700 out of 1,000 on the test, the minimum score required to pass -- it was a fun thing to do in between swimming and playing tag with his brother. 
Ayan, who turned six shortly after his September 24 exam, started getting into computers about three years ago. 
He used to sit next to me and watch me very carefully, says his dad, Asim Qureshi, who also works in IT. 
So Asim started explaining the basics to his son: how to turn a computer on, how to power down, how to access the control panel. 
Before he knew it, Asim had built his son a mini computer-lab in his home office, and Ayan was spending one-to-two hours per day playing around with the operating system. 
While other kids were playing video games and watching TV, Ayan was installing and configuring operating systems and tinkering with routers and switches. 
This is not every kid's idea of fun, but Ayan is different. 
I knew that if I introduced him to the games, he would not go for this, his dad says. 
We checked with Microsoft, and they couldn't tell us if anyone younger has ever been Microsoft-certified. 
Still, it's hard to imagine anyone younger than five reading through the dull Microsoft manuals and practicing the test multiple-choice questions you need in order to make the grade. 
It's not easy to pass the test, says Asim Qureshi. 
We couldn't get an interview with Ayan -- his dad says his son has been overwhelmed by the U.K. media's coverage of his accomplishment -- but the kid told The Independent that he wants to be an IT consultant or a mathematician when he grows up. 
In addition to the Microsoft Command Prompt, he likes remote controlled toys, digital cameras, and science. 
I like compasses and telescopes, but I really like prisms,: he told the paper. 
The rainbow colored light reflected through the prism is amazing. 
Although he's now a Certified Professional, it's still going to be awhile before Ayan puts his skills on the market. 
At the moment, he's just concentrating on his school, says Asim Qureshi. 
But he also will be improving his IT skills.

Alan Turing may be the star of The Imitation Game, but the truly central figure in the film is Christopher. 
Named after Turing's childhood friend and first love, the machine not only breaks the German Enigma code during World War II, but also becomes a forbear to nearly every computer out there including the one you're reading this on. 
The real Christopher was named the Bombe later Victory and although the filmmakers took some liberties in naming their device, they went to great lengths to make sure it looked as much like Turing's revolutionary computer as possible. 
The letter-covered rotors, the wires, the dozens of ports -- it's all there. 
However, production designer Maria Djurkovic Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy did make it open-able so the audience could see its impressive construction. 
She also ran more red wires into the machine, so as to give it the appearance that it has nerves -- and blood running through its veins. 
The actual design is absolutely based on the reality of it, Djurkovic says. 
You extrapolate -- you have to make something that's credible, you have to make something where those cogs turn at different speeds and it effectively has to be doing what the Bombe was doing. 
What's even more impressive is that she was able to build the machine for # 30,000 about $ 48,000. 
The film had a mere $ 15 million budget so it was a lean build -- and cheaper than the one in the film, which Turing Benedict Cumberbatch says will cost him about # 100,000 to make -- and what Djurkovic crafted holds up well to scrutiny. 
So well, in fact, her Christopher has been given a home at Bletchley Park, the UK compound where Turing and his fellow code-breakers created the original Bombe. 
It 'll be on exhibit at Bletchley for a year starting this month. 
Here's how she did it. 
Bletchley Park has a replica of Alan Turing's code-breaking machine, but the filmmakers couldn't exactly borrow it and let Benedict Cumberbatch play with it. 
So Djurkovic and director Morton Tyldum went to Bletchley, which is now a tourist attraction, to figure out how to recreate one. 
They also brought supervising art director Nick Dent, who took photos and measurements of the machine. 
The Christopher replica ended up being a foot or two taller than the original. 
After seeing Turing's machine, Djurkovic and company decided they wanted to make one that could be opened up so audiences could see just how intricate the design was. 
We sort of wandered around this thing 360 degrees and stood at the back of it saying ` This is actually much more interesting -- the nerve center of the machine,' she says. 
There and then we decided we would build it into two sections and split it. 
Designing Christopher required a bit of actual engineering. 
To do so, Dent drew his design in Illustrator using a CAD plug-in. 
It turns Illustrator into a technical drawing package but retains the artistic and visual qualities that the original package allows, Djurkovic says, citing Dent's explanation. 
Rather than AutoCAD or Vectorworks, which doesn't allow for texture or light to be included. 
Click through the slideshow above for Dent's illustrations of Christopher. 
After it was designed, the art department had just a few weeks to build Christopher before filming. 
Djurkovic estimates it took her team -- a collection of staffers and interns -- about five weeks working in three-person teams to finish the Bombe. 
We do everything insanely quickly. 
When I look back on a film after I finish I just think, ` How the bloody hell did we actually do that?' 
she says. 
It's not just Christopher, it's every single aspect of the film. 
Like most movies, The Imitation Game was shot out of order ; that meant that Christopher had to be able to look like it was in different stages of completion. 
It's this business of having to in-build the ability to pull it apart, Djurkovic says. 
You don't know how it's going to work in the schedule, if you're starting with it finished or starting with it in the middle stage. 
You have to adapt. 
Djurkovic's replica looks very close to the real McCoy, but it lacks one important feature: It can't actually crack any codes. 
Oh, no, no, no. 
Absolutely not! 
she laughs when asked if her Bombe can do any calculations. 
The sum total of its mechanism was that its wheels turned in a sequence similar to the real thing. 
The Imitation Game jumps back and forth in time from Turing's time code-breaking in World War II to his childhood to his life in Manchester right before his death. 
Those scenes from his later years show him tinkering with a Christopher-like device. 
The truth is a bit different. 
That machine wasn't in Turing's home, it was at the University of Manchester. 
And it didn't look as much like the Bombe as the one in the film. 
That one was much less closer to the reality, because Morton wanted it to echo Christopher, Djurkovic says. 
He wanted there to be a visual echo so we departed from reality. 
But, she adds, a lot of the other details in his home were accurate. 
Everything that you see on the walls of that Manchester house at the start of the film, that's not some whim of mine. 
That's based on absolutely the kind of things he was studying at that period of his life. 
When a lot of us think about storage, we still think about that archaic method of encoding data by etching patterns into a disk. 
That's so 20th century. 
In the era of flash storage, researchers are now doing amazing things with chemical bonds -- things like storing data on a single molecule. 
A pretty bonkers-sounding breakthrough in chemistry-based data storage hit the pages of Nature this week. 
An international team of researchers has managed to turn a single molecule into a flash storage device. 
The whole device is actually three molecules. 
Two of those hold the hold electrons that act as storage, and they live inside of the third, a nanometer-wide metal oxide molecular cage. 
For this particular experiment, the researchers used tungsten as the cage and selenium trioxide molecules holding extra electrons for the storage. 
There's no beating around the bush: this new approach to flash storage is not coming to the iPhone any time soon. 
In fact, this first experiment really serves as proof of concept and would need vast improvements before it ever became practical. 
They were able to store data in the device for 336 hours but didn't test any longer durations, so it's unclear how stable the model is in the long term. 
Otherwise setting the device and writing data took tenths of seconds and milliseconds. 
To compete with existing flash storage devices, this molecular monster would need to get much faster. 
Researchers say they can theoretically bring those speeds down to picoseconds or less. 
All that said! 
Storing data in molecules is a lot cooler than storing them on shiny plastic disks. 
In the past scientists have managed to store data on layers of graphene, but this new method is both smaller and simpler. 
Which is always a good direction to go in as far as computers and computing is concerned.

My youngest niece and I could not be more different. 
For one, I am 42 and Arianna is 17. 
But we have a few things in common. 
We're both the youngest of three, and we both have a small cluster of ailments that swim together in the Kalem gene pool: eczema, allergies. 
We both grew up in regions overwrought with conformism -- she in Boca Raton, Fla., me on Long Island, N.Y.. 
But in terms of our adolescent experience -- which she is very much in the midst of, and I, when I am honest with myself, feel like I never completely left behind -- we may as well have come of age on different planets. 
Arianna and her friends, like me and mine, were, once upon a time, fascinated with IRL popularity. 
That changed for them when they became the subject of social scrutiny, but not in the way I'd dreamed of -- with party invitations, cute surfer-stoners idling on the curb outside of my house, and a Veronica Sawyer-like grip on both the popular kids and the misfits. 
Instead, where I found pen pals in the back pages of Star Hits and called 1-900 party lines, Arianna and her friends are famous on the Internet. 
As of this writing, my 17-year-old niece has more than 45,000 followers on Instagram. 
At one point she had closer to 50,000. 
Her number of followers jumped significantly when she started dating her now ex-boyfriend, Dylan, who at the time had around 25,000. 
They earned an Instagram celeb nickname -- #darianna, a la Brangelina. 
Every photo she posts gets, by my unscientific calculations, an average of 2,000 to 4,000 likes. 
The ones of just her or her and a few of her girlfriends dressed up or down, as the case is on a beach day -- as opposed to the ones where she's with a mixed-gender group, goofing off in science lab or at McDonalds, or photos of my sister on Mother's Day, about to dig her gift out of a Tory Burch shopping bag -- get closer to 5,000. 
Her photos always get 10 or more comments, and usually closer to 50. 
She deletes the ones that are negative, toward her or toward other people. 
For some reason, a lot of her followers -- her fans -- are from Brazil, and other countries, too. 
They comment in other languages all the time, she tells me. 
I wonder if they think I can understand them? 
Or what the point is? 
But some of it isn't even in the English alphabet. 
Chances are they're saying something about how perfect she is, how gorgeous her hair or eyes are, or asking where she got that top. 
That's what a lot of the comments say. 
One favorite around my house is simply sex with you. 
Not I want to have ... but simply the idea, expressed: sex with you. 
It's not real-world desire ; my niece isn't necessarily real to them. 
The images she posts, the comments she allows to remain, it all paints a picture of a life to be admired and commented on. 
In short, it's what a whole lot of us do with social media. 
She's just really, really good at it. 
My niece and her friends have blogs devoted to them, written by younger girls in their area code and beyond. 
Their social media accounts are hacked and impersonated. 
They are recognized at concerts and at malls. 
But when you talk to them -- as I do, usually when I visit in the fall, descending upon their air-conditioned environs with my tattoos and fun belly and Korean-American husband like a plague of other blowing in from the west -- they are lovely and polite, spending no more time hunched over their girly-pink iPhone cases than, say, my aforementioned husband. 
Arianna, along with her friends, became obsessed with Tumblr in the eighth grade. 
They made videos of themselves dancing, and Savannah -- Arianna's best friend, then and now -- edited them with iMovie and posted them to Tumblr. 
And then Savannah got a boyfriend, Jared. 
And they made a video. 
The age group that Tumblr is for, according to Ari, are people who are trying to find themselves. 
It's all about you and your interests. 
And one of the things people are interested in at that age, and are looking for, is a boyfriend. 
They're so in love with the idea of love. 
And they really do seem like seem like they're in love in the videos, and I think a lot of people just fell in love with the fact that they were in love. 
That first video might melt your brain a little if you are, say, over the age of 30: an eighth-grade couple, looking older than they are, shooting pool and making out, singing along to Maroon 5's Heart's in Stereo in the back of a parent's car, getting photo-bombed by Savannah's little brother, and professing their love for each other. 
He's sometimes shirtless and she is often wearing teeny-tiny shorts. 
The tops of their heads are usually out of frame. 
It's awkward and discomfiting and painfully sweet -- in short, somehow a perfect encapsulation of tween romance. 
Every day, Arianna recalls, it just kept getting more and more notes, and we were all so excited because to have one of your pictures or videos get a lot of notes is pretty much a huge compliment. 
And so from that she got a lot of followers. 
So she posted another video of her relationship and that, too, got hundreds of thousands of notes. 
And before we knew it, she had hundreds of thousands of followers. 
The last time Arianna remembers checking it, the first video had at least three million views on YouTube. 
That original posting isn't available anymore, and it's impossible to figure out whether or not channels like this one are Savannah's or a fan site. 
Surprisingly, a lot of her stuff gets reported, says Arianna. 
People say that it's a fake account, just so they can pretend to be the real account. 
Most of her accounts get deleted. 
But Savannah's Tumblr is insanely popular. 
You can't see her follower count, but Arianna says Savannah got bigger than anyone ever has ever been on Tumblr without being a celebrity first. 
Savannah has a fraction of the followers that, say, Kylie Jenner has on Instagram and Twitter. 
But Kylie Jenner was famous before she got all of those followers. 
Wherever we go with Savannah, she gets recognized, says Arianna. 
At the Drake vs. Lil Wayne concert, wherever we go, you just see the expression on people's faces. 
Not just young people, either. 
There were 30-year-olds saying, ` Oh, that's that girl from Instagram,' or, ` It's that Tumblr girl.' 
From being associated with Savannah, Arianna ended up with thousands of followers of her own on Tumblr. 
Then, Instagram came out, and for some reason, that just made everything explode. 
Savannah ended up with more than 500,000 followers ; by association, Arianna got about 20,000 of her own. 
A couple months later is when ` Trill Fam' began, and for some reason, the followers loved that. 
Trill Fam was the combination of Arianna and Savannah's friends and Jared's friends. 
They named themselves after Trill Entertainment, a record label out of Baton Rouge, and the girls became BBOD bad bitches or die, the boys HHOD Hypnotiq hooligans or die. 
Arianna's Instagram handle, aritunechii, references Lil Wayne's nickname. 
Because we were in 8th grade, Arianna says, and we thought we were funny. 
We thought we were bad. 
When I was in middle school, my girlfriends and I had a club called ILBC the I love boys club ; our theme songs were Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse of the Heart and Quiet Riot's cover of Cum on Feel the Noize. 
Nobody cared but us. 
The group's popularity grew. 
All of us began frequently making it to the popular page of Instagram, where more people would discover us, Arianna explains. 
And then, early last year, when Arianna was 16, she started dating Dylan, a boy who had gone to their high school but had graduated the year before. 
Here's a video of him asking her to be his girlfriend, essentially, as filmed by Savannah and with a special guest appearance by my sister, Ari's mom. 
Dylan and Arianna -- #darianna -- went out for about a year and a half. 
That's a little longer than I went out with my one real high school boyfriend, which was a pretty big deal to me at the time, even without the Internet. 
I was badly bullied at my high school, so any romantic physical contact I'd had with classmates had been on the down-low. 
I met my boyfriend, Adam, at my summer job, and he lived a few towns over. 
He drove a late-50s vintage car, turned me on to the Velvet Underground, and was one of the coolest people I'd ever met while still being totally sweet. 
I broke up with him shortly before prom, because I felt badly that he liked me more than I him. 
As it turns out, that's pretty much how Arianna felt about her breakup with Dylan, in spite of the fact that her relationship had very public stakes. 
When I asked her whether she thought her relationship would have been different if she only had a handful of social media followers, she said she doesn't think so. 
I started dating him because he was -LSB- part of Trill Fam -RSB-, and so we were hanging out 24-7, that kind of thing. 
But Instagram as a part of it? 
Not so much. 
I just posted pictures. 
I liked getting likes on them. 
But I didn't post them to get likes on them. 
And when they broke up, she says, I never even announced to my followers or anything that we broke up. 
I just changed my bio so it didn't say ` love Dylan Baitz' anymore. 
I just erased it and he erased his, so they finally figured it out. 
As for me and my high school flame, well, we're friends on Facebook, and I always try to wish him a happy birthday there with a nostalgic music video link. 
I ended up going to prom with my best girlfriend. 
A lot of the women my age who see the large number of Arianna's followers assume that the majority of them are adult men. 
Arianna disagrees, insisting that most of them are teenage girls. 
I 've received hundreds, maybe even thousands of messages from girls who say that I'm their role model or that I inspire them in some way, she says. 
Most of my fans are in middle school, so I try to act as appropriate as I can so I don't set a bad example. 
She doesn't talk shit online, either. 
I think that I learned to be a nice person because I didn't want to be a mean person in front of fans or for friends to see. 
For the record, she is sometimes mean to her sisters, and they to her, so she's not, you know, abnormal or anything. 
She tries not to curse in her tweets, and doesn't post anything illegal -- so no drinking photos or pictures of her friends getting trashed. 
Of course, other people do post those pictures, and they tag her. 
So there are plenty of photos of her out there, surrounded by red Solo cups. 
There is only so much image curation she can do. 
There was one point I really started hating it, she says. 
And that's when I realized that all of the pictures I 've posted of me and that other people have posted can be easily found. 
But she keeps things positive in her own comments with the careful eye of someone who is building both a self-image and a brand. 
That image curation is a big piece of what my generation of teenagers was missing: if you couldn't perform cool or pretty with enough skill, you were outed as neither. 
There was no second life online. 
You played the hand you were dealt, which means that, no matter how rich my adolescent fantasy life, I was not glamorous or even witty to my high school peers. 
I was one of a small brand of freaks, and not the one the football players secretly wanted to date, or the one with the elaborate makeup who looked like she stepped out of a John Hughes movie. 
Perhaps I would have self-created on social media, if I'd had it. 
Or perhaps I'd have been just as sensitive and eager to please on the Internet, and it would have been my downfall, as it was in the halls of my high school. 
We 've been taught at so many assemblies not to bully that I think there aren't bullies anymore, says Arianna. 
Not like there used to be -- stealing your lunch money and picking on you in dodgeball. 
But there's cyber-bullying, which feels more dangerous to me. 
With cyber-bullying, there's only so many times you can tell yourself that it will get better, that somewhere out there are people who will understand you. 
Because there is much harder evidence on your iPhone that somewhere out there are people who want to hurt you. 
Arianna, for her part, can not recall ever being bullied. 
When other kids have gotten picked on in her comments, she has deleted the bullies. 
And the only strangers' messages she responds to are those from people who talk about getting bullied, or who have something in their life really getting them down. 
She has messaged these people privately, and made connections with some that way, connections that have lasted a year or two. 
Most of what she has seen has taken place in middle school -- among her own tween classmates which was wa-a-ay back in the Myspace days or, later, with her primarily younger demographic. 
But, she says, people definitely still have Twitter beef, the sub-tweeting and mean tweets. 
It's easy to make fake accounts, too, and that's a way of bullying: impersonating someone else, not to live in their skin as the fake accounts devoted to Arianna and Savannah do, but rather to lampoon them, put words in their mouths. 
This kind of impersonation, of course, is not new. 
It's just easier. 
When I was in eleventh grade, I started getting phone calls from a boy. 
He said he was someone my friends and I had met at a dance club ; I made up a fake boyfriend to keep him at arm's length, but kept taking his calls. 
I guess I was flattered. 
At some point he stopped calling, or maybe I stopped answering. 
But shortly after that, one of our group, Kristina, confided in me that the boy who'd been calling me had actually been the older boyfriend of another friend. 
And that most of the people we hung out with had, at one point or another, been in the room with him, laughing at my fake boyfriend, at my gullibility, my desperation. 
Sometime not too long after I headed off to college, I learned how to curate my image. 
I got myself what I thought was a pretty cool nickname, grew out my perm, and traded the long black coat and cheap pointy buckle boots for Chinese slippers and vintage dresses sloppily cut into minis. 
I took down fat sacs of weed and went dancing at smoky Southern rock clubs. 
And nearly no one who had gone to my high school followed, so my secret was safe. 
I still curate my image ; we all do. 
But as adults, we are a bit more careful with our brands than we would have been as teenagers. 
And while Arianna has been good at painting one kind of picture, she is now worried about how that picture will play in her immediate future. 
I was scared that colleges would Google my name, she says, and wonder, ` what did this girl do? 
,' and if it would affect admissions. 
But my teachers convinced me that, with this generation, people don't care that much. 
We all have stuff on the internet. 
And they don't have time to Google everyone that applies to college. 
But I want to be able to, when I go off to college, just be able to contact people I know from my hometown, see all their comments on my photos, not all these little girls and Brazilians. 
She contemplates just deleting her accounts after graduation next spring, starting fresh, just like me. 
Maybe starting an account so she can just keep in touch with the people she actually knows. 
But it's more complicated than that for her. 
Unless all of her friends jump ship, too, the fans will come calling, find her through an errant tag, and the whole thing starts over again. 
Unlike me, she doesn't have the luxury of time -- and the technological lag time between centuries -- to ditch her followers. 
But she has gone back to Tumblr more often lately, to look at photography, and to Twitter to read funny posts. 
She posts to Instagram less and less frequently. 
As a user, she is starting to look out at the world, rather than inviting it to look at her. 
Part of Arianna's brand-building has been not posting photos wherein she looks bad. 
And as hopefully as I showed her the Pretty Girls Making Ugly Faces Tumblr -- praying she'd get the hint that life is not all about what's on the outside -- I know that, when I was a teenager, I desperately wanted to be pretty. 
I wanted to be perceived as funny, too, and smart. 
But I really, really wanted to be pretty. 
One of the first things that struck me about Arianna's social media celebrity -- on Instagram, in particular -- is how many comments declare her perfection. 
I assumed it would give a person a big head, or put pressure on them to perform ; Arianna denies both. 
I definitely think that other things affect me more, like coming across a picture of Tumblr of a bunch of pretty girls. 
Or seeing a really perfect body on Tumblr, a really skinny girl. 
That makes me more pressured than them calling me perfect. 
So, like so many women, Ari falls into trap of thinking she's not good enough, with most positive compliments not really sinking in. 
She understands that it's all relative, and in our conversation tried to imagine posting an ugly photo one day. 
I hope they wouldn't call me ugly. 
I hope that they would be like, eh, she's still pretty. 
Would I ever? 
Yeah, I don't care that much. 
That perceived perfection is up in the air, on servers, in our phones and tablets, but not in our physical space. 
The elementary school fangirls and grammatically challenged fanboys are, for the most part, no realer to my niece than she is to them. 
Sometimes I wonder: if I had had social media, constructed an identity online, gotten outfit critiques from glamorous strangers and mixtapes from boys in the U.K., would I have ever bothered to connect with real people at university? 
I 've written many essays about this, says my niece, always backed up by studies about how it makes us antisocial, and we can't communicate the same way. 
I was taught to think that. 
And now I think, who would have thought you could get famous by posting pictures on Instagram? 
It's a different way of communicating. 
The internet as a whole may be taking a toll on the way we communicate face-to-face. 
But I think it is also opening up a variety of ways we can communicate. 
But, I protested, her becoming famous is one-way. 
She's posting images, beaming one-way, and people are commenting and saying she's so cool, she's so perfect. 
If I walked up to her in the mall and complimented her, she would have to respond to me. 
But if I write that on her photo, she doesn't have to do anything. 
You're right, Arianna says. 
But also, if someone from another country commented and I wanted to write back, I could. 
And that would be a person that I would have never come across if it wasn't for social media. 
If I decided to make a business and I wanted to advertise my business, it's a huge advertisement opportunity. 
Or if I wanted everyone to sign a petition for world hunger, I could do that. 
Both of those things are kinds of selling, and selling is, no doubt, what so many of us are doing online. 
Social media teaches my niece about the world ; she teaches the world about Boca. 
And soon she 'll head out, and leave as much of it behind as she's willing or able to. 
Maybe she 'll delete all of her accounts ; maybe just one or two. 
Maybe she 'll even get a nickname.

Some South African sheep got a nasty little surprise earlier this week when a Google-branded internet balloon came tumbling down from the heavens to say hello. 
The sheep are in good company, though. 
Because this happens -- a lot. 
And fortunately for the conspiracy theorists among us, this means all the UFO fodder their chemtrail-addled brains can handle. 
Ever since Google's Project Loon project, which will carry internet access to rural and developing nations, first got its start back in 2011, the mysterious balloons have flown off course, or malfunctioned and come crashing down. 
The Google X project is, naturally, shrouded in secrecy, and Google is constantly tweaking the shape, size, and design of the balloons. 
To most people these rogue balloons are, quite literally, unidentified flying objects. 
We 've put together a brief collection of the many, many UFO sightings these noble balloons have fostered. 
Because while the truth may be out there, it's a hell of a lot more fun to scream aliens instead. 
Was it actually a Project Loon balloon? 
Yes. 
Was it actually a Project Loon balloon? 
Yes. 
Was it actually a Project Loon balloon? 
Yes. 
Was it actually a Project Loon balloon? 
Yes. 
Was it actually a Project Loon balloon? 
Yes. 
Alternate acceptable answers: Nazis and Yes, but Nazis. 
Was it actually a Project Loon balloon? 
Yes. 
Was it actually a Project Loon balloon? 
Yes. 
For months, federal officials in Washington, D.C., have been on the ground in Missouri, offering training and tips to ease community tensions and try to prevent violence. 
That work has picked up steam in recent days as elected officials and protest groups in Ferguson steel for an announcement about the grand jury that's been hearing evidence since August. 
Images of armored vehicles, police clad in riot gear, and weapons pointed at unarmed demonstrators protesting the Aug. 9 death of Michael Brown startled the nation and provoked an ongoing conversation about militarization of local law enforcement. 
The American Civil Liberties Union responded by repeatedly suing local authorities in Missouri for allegedly violating the First Amendment rights of peaceful protesters. 
Holder says in the video that durable relationships between police and their communities do not develop overnight. 
And he praises the vast majority of law enforcement agents for behaving well amid the intense national glare. 
History has ... shown us that the most successful and enduring movements for change are those that adhere to nonaggression and nonviolence. 
And so I ask all those who seek to lend their voice to important causes and discussions, and who seek to elevate these vital conversations, to do so in a way that respects the gravity of their subject matter, Holder says. 
You can save on remodeling by preparing a space as much as possible before the contractors arrive. 
With the proper tools, removing a non-load bearing wall is a simple task, and loads of fun. 
Then assemble your tools, which will include: a reciprocating saw, a flat/pry bar, a box cutter, and a hammer. 
You should also wear work gloves and eye protection unlike Josh in the above video from eHow. 
Start by removing any trim or moulding using your flat bar and hammer. 
Then use your knife and cut through the drywall tape and mud that is at the seams along the ceiling and corners. 
Then the fun begins! 
Using your hammer, break through the drywall and pull it off to reveal the studs. 
Remove the vertical studs using your recip saw and pry up the floor studs with your flat bar. 
Check out the video above to see the process in action. 
Another day, another password leak. 
This time it's PlayStation Network, 2K Game Studios, and Windows Live -- three years after the last PSN compromise. 
CNET and Geek.com report that hacker group DerpTrolling claim to have 7 million logins and 500,000 credit card data -- including Comcast, Twitter, Facebook, and other sites. 
You know the drill by now. 
To be safe, it's time to change your passwords and make sure they're all unique and strong -- and enable two-factor authentication wherever possible. 
You can also use LastPass or your favorite password manager to audit your passwords.

Hot or Not founder James Hong has come a long way since building a site that helped people rank the attractiveness of others, ultimately paving the path for speed dating apps like Tinder. 
Today a father of three, Hong now has a different set of priorities. 
One of those was keeping his kids safe from the unsuitable, adult-oriented content that fills YouTube. 
To fix the problem for himself and his kids, Hong has launched Cakey, a YouTube app for children. 
YouTube has a lot of great content for kids, from cartoons and sing-alongs to kids' TV clips and toy unboxing videos, Minecraft and Legos videos, and much more. 
But the problem with allowing kids to access Google's YouTube application is that it's not locked down. 
Kids can too easily stumble on inappropriate content, like Elmo cursing. 
Funny for adults, maybe, but cringe-worthy if you catch your kids watching that. 
While most parents just yank the phone or tablet out of kids' hands in horror, Hong had a better solution. 
Being a technologist himself, he simply built and app to solve this problem. 
Called Cakey, this free app isn't really a company yet. 
It's more of a personal project Hong is releasing into the wild to help other parents like him. 
I haven't coded in 15 years, so it required me coming up to speed on stuff and having to learn how to program iPhone apps, says Hong. 
Somehow between helping out at home, angel investing, and my wife delivering a third baby, I managed to squeeze enough hours of coding in to get Cakey built. 
I literally built most of the Cakeyvillage website overnight in the hospital while waiting for our new baby to arrive. 
There are no in-app purchases or ads in Cakey, which makes it attractive to thrifty parents. 
Instead, Cakey offers a basic interface to YouTube where users can browse through pre-screened video collections presented in a film reel-like interface. 
These collections include only kid-safe videos across a variety of popular topics and categories. 
Meanwhile, parents can slide their finger at the bottom of the screen to launch into the Parent Mode section, protected by a PIN, which allows them to add or remove video collections. 
While the app comes pre-stocked with videos to keep your child entertained, parents are also able to build their own collections in Parent Mode. 
Here, they can search across YouTube and preview videos and video playlists before adding them to their own collection. 
There's even a handy trick that lets you screen videos more quickly -- by tapping and holding on the video playing, the app will play it back at 5x speed, allowing you to get an idea of the content without suffering through the whole video. 
Another technically creative feature is the way the app syncs up with content found on Cakey's website. 
After signing up, parents receive an email with a link that allows parents to connect their phone with computer where the link is clicked. 
Afterwards, parents can then search for new collections or create their own via the web, instead of having to go into the app itself. 
These collections can also be shared with other community members, allowing parents to help each other. 
Explains Hong, I built it outside the app because parents are busy and don't often get around to going into their kid's apps. 
He says that Cakey will email parents usage reports, which tells them what collections their kids are choosing to watch. 
That way, when it comes time to update the content, parents know what videos to add and which ones to remove. 
By building it on the web, parents can do it from work or wherever, and they 'll be triggered by those usage reports I email. 
So basically, Cakey comes to you, says Hong. 
At launch, the app comes with 3,000 videos in 109 collections, and is aimed at children 2 to 6. 
It even has a funny feature clearly built for personal use that pauses videos every minute, then plays a recording of Hong reminding your child to eat. 
Hilariously practical, I might add. 
From the sounds of things, Hong could scale Cakey up quickly if he wanted to. 
He says he could spend a day to increase its video content by 10 times, and has categories for 40 languages set up, but not filled in yet. 
I used to run a site that helped people make babies, Hong jokes. 
Now I'm helping them raise ` em. 
Results of the study, led by Dr. Marty Makary, a professor of surgery, and conducted independently from ProPublica, were published last week by the Journal of Patient Safety. 
The study found: 
Another study last year in the Journal of Patient Safety estimated that at least 210,000 U.S. hospital patients a year die from medical mistakes. 
Yet while the problem is widespread, Makary and his research team wrote, there is little research into how patients feel about experiencing medical harm. 
Clinicians may see the need to be more open with patients but lack the moral courage to do it, researchers said. 
Patient advocates and providers should work together on how to best inform patients, and medical schools and training programs can introduce the needed skills, they said. 
The questionnaire helps ProPublica's reporters find stories and trends. 
Only respondents who first consented to participate were included in Makary's research. 
How You Can Help Us Investigate Patient Safety: Patients who have been harmed, or their loved ones, are invited to complete ProPublica's questionnaire. 
Researchers interested in the data can email reporter Marshall Allen at marshall.allen@propublica.org. 
ProPublica is a nonprofit investigative reporting newsroom based in New York. 
Each year Lego puts out an exclusive modular building and they are always pretty special. 
In January of 2015, Detective's Office 10246 hits the shelves. 
Pricing is set at $ 159.99 for this 2,262 piece kit that measures over 10 high and is packed full of awesome play and gorgeous design. 
This area features some really special stuff like an awesome ceiling fan that can be rotated out of the way so you have better access to the brick built pool table. 
There is a 2x2 round tile with a printed dart board as well ; this is a brand new element. 
I believe that the window elements for the front also have The Highlander printed on them as there is no mention of stickers for this set. 
This is a very small but functional barber shop with one really cool secret. 
There is a secret door behind the cabinet leading to the rear of the building for smuggling contraband through, then another secret passageway under the stairs leading to the pool hall to deliver the smuggled goods to the party on that side. 
We also get some scissors as a new minifigure accessory and an actual element with a reflective surface for the mirror in the shop, not a sticker as we originally thought. 
On the left side of the second floor is the office of Ace Brickman, Private Detective. 
The first thing to notice here is that the walls on all sides are created with profile bricks or brick bricks as many in the AFOL community call them. 
There is a lot of printed tile in here as well: a wanted poster, map, ship painting, newspaper and a few different letters, one of which is hidden in the wall. 
Also on the second floor, across the hall from the detective's office, is a bathroom with a pull chain toilet, a Lego first. 
I'm glad they 've started including restrooms into more sets. 
Everybody poops. 
On the third floor, right side, we have a kitchen complete with some cabinets, a stove and a gigantic rolling pin. 
This is apparently where the illegal cookies are made before they are smuggled down to the pool players. 
As always, this set will snap together with previous modular buildings via some Technic pins at the base. 
It looks right at home next to the Parisian Restaurant 10243 and Palace Cinema 10232. 
I'm really looking forward to adding it to my city street and helping Ace Brickman solve some crime in my little Legopolis. 
When you're an adult who drives on a regular basis, you fantasize about fast cars and other high-performance vehicles. 
But when you're a kid, who doesn't get to drive at all, even mundane vehicles like garbage trucks and buses are exciting. 
So while the thought of a tiny RC tractor might be hard for you to get excited over, you can bet your kid would love one. 
Thankfully, Tamiya hasn't limited the performance of this Kumamon-themed a cartoon mascot for Japan's Kumamoto Prefecture district tractor. 
Kids can still use it for miniature hayrides or plowing a tiny plot of land in the backyard, but it can also easily keep up with the fastest RC toys in a race. 
And for $ 250 it might just teach your kids some useful farming skills, as long as they understand that harvesting crops at 80mph just isn't a good idea.

Up there with coin tosses and dice rolls, the classic game of rock paper scissors has settled many an argument. 
In theory, rock paper scissors is totally random, but it actually isn't e.g., this guy. 
Based on psychology and a ton of data, we can predict the chances of what someone will throw based on what they threw last. 
For the record, that screenshot is totally a humblebrag. 
I quickly went down seven games to three. 
While the normal setting of this game only uses the data it collects on you, the veteran setting of this game gathers data from all the other people it has played. 
Think you have what it takes? 
Check it out at the link below. 
The 3 month programme will be just the incubation programme on the bus without the work experience. 
The 6 month programme includes 3 months working in a local startup gaining experience and skills followed by 3 months building a startup on the bus. 
At the same time, IncuBus runs like a mobile co-working space. 
It costs just # 1.45 per day, to spend a day on IncuBus London, or # 5 for the week. 
This is insanely cheap. 
They're trying to hit me with some bill, can you believe it? 
he said on the show, referring to the Internal Revenue Service. 
Well, saying it's outrageous doesn't respond to whether you're going to pay the bill or not, she said. 
Outrageous or not, will you pay this tax bill? 
Johnson's response: I'm -- no, is the answer. 
I think, it's absolutely outrageous. 
Why should I? 
I think, you know, I'm not a -- I, you know, I haven't lived in the United States for, you know, well, since I was 5 years old. 
Page then proceeded to ask Johnson why he continued to carry a U.S. passport. 
The London mayor replied that it's very difficult to give up. 
Johnson is widely considered a contender to succeed British Prime Minister David Cameron as head of the ruling Conservatives should the party lose power at the next elections. 
That means that, at least in theory, he could become prime minister, a point at which he might have to renounce his U.S. citizenship. 
The Guardian notes that Johnson, in his capacity as mayor of London, has criticized the U.S. Embassy for not paying the city's congestion charge. 
The U.K. government says U.S. Embassy owes the city about $ 12 million, but the Embassy says the charge is a tax from which its diplomats are immune. 
The newspaper adds: 
Johnson would also be liable to pay US income tax as he earns well above the foreign-earned income exclusion -- the level up to which no tax is paid on income earned by US citizens overseas -- which was set at $ 97,600 # 62,000 last year. 
As mayor, he earns a salary of # 144,000 and on top of that he is paid # 250,000 a year for his column in the Telegraph. 
Johnson did not disclose whether he paid US taxes on his income during the interview. 
The mayor's spokesman said he would not be commenting further on his US tax affairs. 
Working with two other researchers at Harvard University, Rubenstein recently created what they call AERobot, a bot that can help teach programming and artificial intelligence to middle school kids and high schoolers. 
That may seem like a rather expensive luxury for most schools, but it's not. 
It costs just $ 10.70. 
The hope is that it can help push more kids into STEM, studies involving science, technology, engineering, and math. 
The tool is part of a widespread effort to teach programming and other computer skills to more children, at earlier stages. 
It's called the code literacy movement, and it includes everything from new and simpler programming languages to children's books that teach coding concepts. 
Rubenstein's project grew out of the 2014 AFRON Challenge, held back in January, which called for researchers to design low-cost robotic systems for education in the developing world. 
Part of Harvard's Self-Organizing Systems Research Group, Rubstein has long studied swarm robotics, which aims to create herds of tiny robots that can behave as whole, and he ended up adapting one of his swarm systems in order to build AERobot. 
It's a single machine -- not a swarm bot -- but it's built from many of the same inexpensive materials. 
He and his colleagues assembled most of the electronics with a pick-and-place machine -- a machine that automatically builds printed circuit boards -- and in order to further cut costs, they used vibration motors for locomotion and left out a chassis. 
The device doesn't include its own programming interface or charger. 
It gets both from a desktop or laptop computer, plugging into the USB port. 
There are no extra frills, Rubenstein says. 
On the software side, Rubenstein modified a programming language called minibloqs, a highly graphical means of programming machines. 
You don't really need to type code. 
You drag pictures, he explains. 
Say I wanted an LED on the robot to turn green. 
I would just drag over an image of an LED, and pick the green color. 
The language, he says, is a bit like Scratch, the programming language for kids developed at MIT. 
The bot can move forwards and backwards on flat surfaces, turn in place, detect light, follow lines and edges, and identify distances using reflected infrared light. 
And the idea is that kids will learn but programming the bot to do such things. 
Rubenstein and his team provide a fifteen-lesson curriculum that walks students through the sensors and the actuators, the programming flow and logic, and how to create specific robot behavior. 
At the 2014 AFRON Challenge, AERobot won the top honor in the software category, and it took second place in the hardware and curriculum categories. 
The team has since tested it with about 100 sixth - to eighth - graders at a STEM-focused summer camp called i2Camp, and they plan to do further tests this coming summer. 
Rubenstein says that for the bot's next iteration, the group is focusing on improving the curriculum and the software, eliminating steps in the installation process and ensuring AERobot is so simple that kids can learn how to use the thing on their own -- without a teacher. 
Do you remember the first computer game you played? 
What about the first program you downloaded? 
Unless you 've just emerged Brendan-Fraser-in-Encino Man-style from the earth, wholly unaware of computers in which case, I have several questions for you, your early digital distractions are probably years, if not decades old by now. 
That doesn't mean they're lost. 
There's a good chance somebody out there is working to make sure that version of Pizza Tycoon you were obsessed with in 1994 still exists. 
And they're probably breaking the law to do it. 
Abandonware is a melancholy nickname reserved for software that's been abandoned by its makers. 
Instead of preserving old games, or making them publicly available, many effectively ancient and often defunct rights holders don't do anything, often because they went defunct before they had the chance. 
Maybe they still have the copyright, maybe it got sold off in some bankruptcy proceeding. 
But the game isn't actively supported or sold, but someone somewhere technically owns it, even if they don't remember or care. 
Not every dusty program is considered abandonware. 
Some old-school software is formally given away by its original owners, making it freeware. 
And pirated older programs are just pirated older programs if their makers still offer support or even sell digital copies of their game. 
Classic gaming website GOG.com offers a wide array of vintage games like Rollercoaster Tycoon or Duke Nukem 3 for a reasonable price. 
It re-commercializes vintage hits, and in doing so, clasps them back from the dead zone. 
But plenty of other good games and programs linger, ignored and unsupported. 
Archiving and sharing this kind of software is technically piracy, but the community devoted to the survival of programs forsaken by their owners is motivated by love, not cheapness or greed. 
After all, in these cases piracy is the only option. 
Ford's fascination with reviving forgotten software is not odd. 
Reviving Web 1.0 aesthetics is something of a trend these days, but this especially devoted faction of revivalists specializes in actually swapping and preserving discontinued programs. 
These are the abandonians, the champions of abandonware. 
I talked to Rafael Lopes Vivian, the site runner for an abandonware webring, about his long-standing interest in retro-software. 
He doesn't condone pirating things that can be bought conventionally. 
If he can buy it instead, he will, though he's quick to point out that not everyone in the community shares that view. 
When GOG appeared, abandonware was starting to finally get what it wanted: To have normal commercially supported access to classic games. 
Imagine the faces on us old-timers seeing games like Fallout, Baldur's Gate, Leisure suit Larry and more on sale for $ 9.99. 
Most of the best abandonware sites had what they asked for, he told me. 
Pretty much every game from 2000 and on is still playable somehow. 
If anyone calls Wasteland 1988 abandonware now, he's trying to justify his will to not pay for a readily available product, Vivian said. 
He's invested in abandonware because so many programs have been left to dissipate in digital purgatory. 
There are still games out there that need to be played and people still can't access them, he said. 
This determination to make sure these games are still out there is driving force behind the movement, the reason people on Reddit call themselves abandonians and swap discarded games. 
Baptiste Placé, who runs MyAbandonware.com, has a similar archival drive. 
Keeping old games as a museum of computer games is a great goal, he told me. 
He focuses on the 80s and 90s -- Oregon Trail and Mario Teaches Typing are two of the most popular options on his website. 
To these archivists of orphaned code, obsolescence is never inevitable. 
They create, play, store, and share emulations, or programs that duplicate an older computer system or video game console, or other gadget on a newer one, to run an old program in a way that seems authentic. 
A non-profit called the Internet Archive stores millions of outdated programs, and runs the The Old School Emulation Center TOSEC an expansive retrocomputing initiative dedicated to cataloging software from a variety of very old platforms, from Apple's doomed Lisa to the Commodore computer series. 
There's even Sega Pico and the Mattel Aquarius yep, Mattel sold a minicomputer, complete with little printer and 16K RAM. 
They're thorough. 
It is the most comprehensive online gallery of abandonware, a true library. 
It started in 1996, and it's no fringe organization ; Internet Archive collaborates with the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian to archive and allow access to these games. 
The digital extinction abandonware supporters fight against is not hypothetical. 
The beloved old-school games of our past are disappearing. 
Atari literally trashed the source code of some of its games, as it in buried them in a garbage heap, and only in 2014 unearthed it from the dump. 
The games could 've easily lingered among actual rubbish until everyone who grew up playing Atari had died. 
Instead, the dug-up games racked in $ 37,000 on eBay for the city of Alamogordo, New Mexico. 
A copy of E.T.. 
The Extra-Terrestrial sold for $ 1,537 alone. 
Since Atari buried the games in Alamogordo's landfill, the city took over ownership. 
While most of the program neglect isn't quite as dramatic, for people who care about the history of computing and software, or simply don't want to give up their favorite games just because they're too old, salvaging abandonware is a gesture of devotion. 
It's birthed a strange paradox: summoning Photoshop 1.0 on a MacBook Pro is both a technical copyright violation and an act of preservation. 
Since abandonware sharing still exists in legal limbo -- not actively prosecuted in most cases but still legally a copyright violation -- there is still plenty of work to be done to legitimize the hobby. 
The IA has made progress, but its collection of abandonware could get shut down if game makers went after it. 
But the archive is interested in preservation, not piracy. 
Its mission statement is earnest: 
Many early movies were recycled to recover the silver in the film. 
The Library of Alexandria - an ancient center of learning containing a copy of every book in the world - was eventually burned to the ground. 
Even now, at the turn of the 21st century, no comprehensive archives of television or radio programs exist.But without cultural artifacts, civilization has no memory and no mechanism to learn from its successes and failures. 
And paradoxically, with the explosion of the Internet, we live in what Danny Hillis has referred to as our digital dark age. 
The Internet Archive is working to prevent the Internet - a new medium with major historical significance - and other born-digital materials from disappearing into the past. 
Meanwhile, the Electronic Frontier Foundation is lobbying to make it legal to save classic computer programs that have been neglected. 
The group recently petitioned the Library of Congress for DMCA exemption for certain gaming abandonware. 
As games deactivate and servers shut down, the ability to modify authentication controls and start new servers is vital to preserving player communities, the petition reads. 
Communities can disperse quickly once gameplay becomes impossible. 
This means that keeping them playable after support stops will be enormously difficult. 
The abandonware most likely to be lost forever isn't abandoned yet. 
Games around now often don't require players to buy a hard copy, meaning when the online support goes, there's not going to be much to fall back on. 
Advocacy groups and volunteers are offering up legal expertise just as Placé and Vivian offer up their time and energy to host sites. 
That's the kind of enthusiasm saving these games generates. 
They may be abandonware, but they are far from abandoned. 
While any single incident can be dismissed as a one-off problem, collectively, the incidents send a message to IT managers and the general public: The cloud can not be secured and therefore can not be trusted. 
The bad guys just move too fast and always stay one step ahead. 
As a result, the public and IT managers alike now increasingly hold organizations accountable for the security of data in the cloud. 
And in light of NSA surveillance, corporate IT buyers, especially in Europe, are taking a dimmer view of any cloud-computing assets located on American soil or owned by American providers. 
Soon, cloud customers could decide they 've had enough. 
Better to lock things down as tight as possible inside one's own data center than to trust your business, personal data or reputation to a nebulous cloud, the porosity of which varies from provider to provider and from week to week. 
But the numbers tell a different story: According to IDC, public cloud service alone will hit $ 107 billion in 2017. 
That's because, despite all the concerns, the cloud makes sense from the perspective of economics, technology and culture. 
From a technology standpoint, the cloud is easy to use, fast to scale and flexible as an on-demand solution. 
As for security, the blame often falls on everything from sloppy implementation to poor password hygiene -- problems not unique to cloud computing. 
Economically, the cloud gives organizations a way to replace the high capital cost of establishing and maintaining a data center with a subscription model. 
That's too compelling to pass up, at least for now. 
Culturally, technology has always had an adoption curve that puts it ahead of public acceptance. 
For example, when browser cookies first became widely known in the mid-90s, reports filled the press about their invasion of our privacy. 
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission held hearings about them. 
People wrote to their elected officials. 
Today, cookies are as much a part of the web experience as the browser itself. 
We have accepted the incremental loss of privacy as part of having access to the World Wide Web essentially at no dollar cost. 
If you're less than 30 years old, you can't remember a time without the Internet. 
Not too long ago, it was only technology professionals that were interacting with computers. 
Now it's everyone. 
And even the best technology can't account for the weakest point of failure in any technological system: the end user. 
If the underlying technology is not keeping up with today's demands, how would anyone know that, especially someone for whom online has always been the norm? 
The same cultural shift is happening with cloud computing. 
Not so long ago, businesses could not conceive of running IT resources anywhere but in a physical data center that they owned or rented from a provider. 
Today, tens of thousands of businesses are forgoing the purchase of their own computing, storage and application resources and just getting these from the cloud or placing them in the cloud. 
From CIOs to security chiefs and compliance officers to IT staff to business line workers, the where and how no longer matter. 
Only what and what it costs matter. 
As part of that cost, providers and consumers need to accept that their data may not be 100 percent secure as we know, nothing is and/or private but it may be secure/private enough to make economic sense. 
Another broader cultural shift affects the adoption of cloud computing: the move to the pay as you go economy. 
In greater numbers, people especially the sub-30-year-old set are renting houses instead of buying, sharing cars instead of owning, streaming music subscriptions rather than buying CDs and downloads. 
The use what you need mentality in the mainstream population will translate into a cloud computing model for startups and more established businesses alike. 
That's why the cloud isn't going anywhere and in fact will continue to grow as a critical IT infrastructure tool. 
We may have reached the end of Cloud 1.0, because, as we know too well, nothing in technology ever remains the same. 
But cloud breaches such as the iCloud photo situation or widely publicized storage hacks will only cause technology providers and end-users to develop better systems and increase their vigilance. 
Behavior will adapt to current technology realities, just as it has since the invention of fire. 
The free market can sort all this out. 
If people feel that Apple's iCloud is not secure enough, they 'll put their photos somewhere else. 
Or just keep them on their phones and computers. 
For enterprises, that same calculus exists, albeit on a much larger scale. 
If a startup is going to bet its future and its investors' capital on Amazon Web Services, then AWS better have terms of service that ensure reliability, security, privacy and compliance. 
If not, Google, Microsoft, IBM or Oracle will happily step in with their own cloud offerings. 
And step in they will. 
Because no matter who is delivering the cloud, it is here to stay. 
It's really too good a concept to go away. 
When it comes to the cloud, I'd say we're entering inning No. 2 of a nine-inning ball game. 
Time after time, the president has chosen to ignore the will of the American people and re-write federal law on his own without a vote of Congress, House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, said in announcing the lawsuit. 
That's not the way our system of government was designed to work. 
If this president can get away with making his own laws, future presidents will have the ability to as well. 
The House has an obligation to stand up for the Constitution, and that is exactly why we are pursuing this course of action. 
If you remember, the House voted last July to authorize a lawsuit. 
At the time, House Republicans complained that Obama had overstepped his authority when he unilaterally delayed the employer mandate for insurance coverage under Obamacare. 
Democrats have cast a legal challenge as strange. 
Republicans, they say, are attacking Mr. Obama for delaying enforcement of a law that they vehemently oppose. 
The health care law was passed in 2010 without any Republican votes, and House Republicans have voted dozens of times to repeal all or part of it. 
... House Republicans struggled to find a law firm willing to take their case. 
Two withdrew, but on Tuesday, Mr. Boehner hired Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University. 
Over 70 percent of Sephora's in-store customers are also iPhone owners, according to internal company research. 
But Sephora had to hold off on being part of the first major retail outlets announced when Apple Pay first launched because it didn't have the NFC enabled pin pass at the time. 
It has since doubled down on technology that would allow it to use Apple Pay. 
Sephora says this required an entire software overhaul to get the mobile payment technology ready in time for the holiday shopping season. 
Sephora to Go integrated Apple Pay into its payment options over two weeks ago. 
Now Sephora will be able to process mobile payments within physical locations as well. 
Other retailers such as Walgreens have said mobile wallet payments have doubled with Apple Pay. 
Whole Foods reported over 150,000 Apple Pay transactions since launching. 
Who's Dreaming Now? 
Obama Opponents Do A Weapons Check On Immigration 
The creators of coupon-code finder Honey, which helps online shoppers save at checkout, have now launched a new app called Milk mmm ... milk and honey ... that lets you save at the grocery store. 
The app is now one of many aimed at helping consumers save on consumer packaged good purchases, even if they don't have time for clipping coupons from a newspaper. 
Honey co-founder George Ruan explains why there's been such a rapid increase in grocery rewards app in recent months, saying: Each year, 315 billion coupons worth well over $ 400 billion dollars are distributed. 
But only a tiny fraction is redeemed -- 0.8% -- and usage is dropping. 
For millennials, the time spent on social media each day is a staggering 5.4 hours, Ruan notes. 
The time commitment to keep track of, acquire, manage, and use grocery coupons is a hassle that is no longer worth it for most consumers. 
I consider myself an extreme couponer, so I understand the complaint. 
I save half or more on my grocery bill using coupons, but don't stockpile mass quantities of deals, like on that crazy TV show. 
However, it does take a lot of time to clip, match-up, stack and organize your deals. 
Most people would be happy with just saving a little bit more at the register. 
And for people like me who go all in, these apps are just icing on the cake. 
In general, most of the grocery rewards apps work similarly. 
After shopping, you typically confirm your purchases matching offers in the app by scanning the product's barcode, then uploading a photograph of your receipt. 
In the case of stores that offer store loyalty cards, some apps, like SavingStar, will apply the discounts automatically at checkout. 
The new Milk app fits into this latter group as it, too, only handles digital coupons that are clipped to store loyalty cards. 
Other apps that credit you after you scan your receipt are really offering rebates that are presented like digital coupons, and Milk avoids these. 
That arguably makes it less useful to a wider audience, since many grocery stores have done away with loyalty cards in favor of systems that work via phone numbers plugged in right at point-of-sale. 
However, for those who do shop at one of the over dozen chains that still use loyalty cards, like Kroger, Safeway, Vons, Fry's, Tom Thumb and others, Milk is easy to use. 
You simply add your card to the app, then shop its deals. 
The app organizes its digital coupons into various sections, like baby, beverages, bakery, etc., allowing you to easily find relevant offers. 
You can add the deals to a shopping list in Milk, too, to help you remember what to buy when in the store. 
While apps like ibotta use a pay for performance model to earn commissions on sales, Milk creators plan to charge a monthly fee for its service, which I think is a mistake. 
Couponers, whether digital or otherwise, are interested in cutting costs, not increasing them. 
Ruan says that beta testers saved on average $ 27/month using the app, which means regular users could still save more than they paid to subscribe, but this misunderstands the mentality of those who clip-and-save. 
And with a half-dozen plus competitors on the market, including web couponing giants like Coupons.com, SmartSource.com and others, many consumers may choose to skip the app that charges them directly. 
Ruan notes that Milk doesn't represent a pivot for Honey, whose browser extension has now been installed over a million times, has 300,000 + weekly shoppers, and has processed through $ 750 million of transactions. 
Honey's users have saved over $ 20 million to date, he says. 
The only challenge was that the consumption behavior of grocery is different from what Honey users are used to and it was sure to cause confusion, says Ruan. 
For that reason, we decided to give the grocery app a different name. 
It's an expansion of what we do at Honey -- to save people money in fun and serendipitous ways. 
It's an issue that has spawned a new class of startups tackling a variety of recruiting obstacles. 
With over $ 400 million raised in 120 venture rounds this year, investors are finally directing their attention and cash toward one of the largest pain points for any company -- hiring. 
I think what's happening right now is the realization that bringing top talent is critical to the success of every company, and the competition for talent is fiercer than ever. 
So there's a lot of focus on how to gain a competitive advantage, says Ben Ling of Khosla Ventures, backer of recruiting tech companies like HackerRank and Lever. 
Pymetrics co-founders Frida Polli and Julie Yoo met in a post-doc program at MIT, and built the company around 12 brain imaging games that they applied to differentiating job seekers. 
Launched in September, Pymetrics counts over 30k active users and has an active presence on over 60 college campuses. 
Students can play the 12 games to receive free access to insights about what careers they are best suited to, and Pymetrics connects suitable matches to the companies using their service. 
These are big, long-term trends, says Daniel Chait, founder of recruiting optimization platform Greenhouse Software. 
People have way more jobs than they ever used to. 
When our grandparents got their first job it was most likely their last job, but these days people have 7, 8, 9 jobs throughout their lives and it's very much about finding something great, learning from it and moving on. 
Greenhouse secured early adopters like Airbnb, Uber and Pinterest, all fast-growing tech companies looking for a competitive edge in talent acquisition. 
With over $ 11 million in venture dollars raised, Greenhouse is quickly becoming the platform of choice for a wide span of companies, integrating with other HR tech startups like HackerRank, HireVue, and Entelo to provide managers with the latest innovation in hiring tech. 
But this is changing. 
HR software has been kind of like the step-child of the family -- it doesn't get a lot of the budget or support, says Venky Ganesan of Menlo Ventures, but the realization has come that human capital is the most important capital you have. 
The old HR software is forms and workflow -- it isn't smart. 
All of the applicant tracking systems in the market today are out of date the moment that an applicant takes an interview, Ganesan notes. 
Launching the first intelligent hiring platform next month, Gild has already seen phenomenal adoption, which according to Ganesan is because there's been so much frustration in the market with the existing toolsets. 
It's a sad day for Aereo and all those who believed in it. 
The startup, which allowed people to stream live broadcast television to their computers and mobile devices, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, just months after shutting down operations. 
The news, which Aereo founder and CEO Chet Kanojia announced on the company blog on Friday, marks the end of an era for the embattled startup, which faced opposition from major broadcasters ever since Aereo launched in 2012. 
Like Uber and Airbnb, Aereo has been one of those companies that bucked regulation from the outset. 
Inside the infrastructure that drove its online service, it assigned every Aereo user a mini broadcast TV antenna, and it used this to argue that its service was no different than sticking a pair of bunny ears on your television. 
That way, Aereo could avoid paying retransmission fees for broadcasters' content. 
But broadcasters never bought this argument, and when it came down to it, neither did the Supreme Court. 
In June, Aereo shut down operations indefinitely. 
Now, Kanojia says the company is filing for bankruptcy to avoid the extensive cost and distraction of defending drawn out litigation in several courts. 
We have traveled a long and challenging road, he wrote. 
We stayed true to our mission and we believe that we have played a significant part in pushing the conversation forward, helping force positive change in the industry for consumers. 
Indeed, Aereo has been a force for change in this industry. 
Just last month, one of Aereo's biggest adversaries, CBS, announced the launch of CBS All Access, a subscription service that allows people to stream CBS content online for just $ 5.99 a month. 
A few days before that, HBO announced its own standalone streaming service, which won't require a cable subscription. 
Internet television will live on, though only on the terms of existing content companies -- at least for the moment. 
This may come at the cost of consumers. 
Though many cord cutters have argued that cable packages are a ripoff and feel they should only have to pay for the content they actually watch, they're also coming to realize that paying small sums of money to lots of different content providers is going to add up. 
But even if Aereo's time is over, there may be space for a similar service in the future, as the FCC looks to redefine its regulations about who can and can not retransmit broadcast television. 
Last month, FCC chairman Tom Wheeler proposed a new rule that would allow internet TV providers to license content just like cable and satellite companies do. 
Wheeler acknowledged that Aereo has played a key role in changing the Commission's thinking. 
In a blog post announcing the proposal, Wheeler wrote: Twenty-first century consumers shouldn't be shackled to rules that only recognize 20th century technology. 
I recently ditched my contract with Verizon and switched to Cricket Wireless, an AT&T - owned carrier that was not only cheaper, but let me bring any phone I wanted -- all with great LTE coverage. 
After a few months, I'm shocked that more people haven't done this. 
You don't get something for nothing in this world, and that's still true with off-contract carriers. 
When you pay less, you get less -- but in a lot of cases, it may not matter. 
Here are some of the possible differences you 'll see with an off-contract carrier: 
See a pattern here? 
All of these are possible differences, but every carrier is different, and a lot of these downsides are avoidable if you do your research. 
Pick the features that are most important to you, and find a carrier that caters to those -- and you 'll never notice the downsides you don't care about. 
Check out our guide to choosing a prepaid plan for some suggestions, as well as your five favorite carriers. 
You can even use a site like Prepaid Finder to compare plans from different carriers, which is a great start. 
Keep in mind that some of the bigger companies offer prepaid plans too, so don't discount them just yet -- T-Mobile's are particularly awesome. 
Of course, while I think these carriers are often overlooked, there are some people who will just be better off with a more expensive, traditional contract. 
Here are some things to consider: 
Off-contract plans may not be for everyone, but I'm continually shocked at how many people overlook them despite being the perfect candidate heck, I'm shocked it took me so long. 
So let's set the record straight: off-contract plans aren't just cheap plans with crappy phones and bad service. 
If you do your research and find the right one, it can be an incredible way to save money -- without making a lot of sacrifices. 
Is Google creeping onto Evernote's lawn? 
Probably not, but Google Keep is slowly adding one or two very handy features to encourage you to make it your simple note-taking app of choice. 
This week Mountain View engineers added the option to share notes with other people, and here's how it works. 
The new feature appears as a share button when you view a note on the Web or in the Android app -- it's a plus sign next to a user icon. 
Click or tap on this and you 'll be invited to add someone via their name if they appear in your Google Contacts or their email address. 
Click or tap Save to confirm your choice. 
The sharing is very seamless. 
The note will appear in your friend's Google Keep instantly. 
If they have the Android app installed, they 'll see a notification to that effect ; they 'll also get an email informing them that someone's shared a note. 
There's no confirmation stage so presumably you can spam your friend's Google Keep pages, should you really want to. 
On a shared note, everyone has editing privileges and everyone can add new members. 
You can easily remove yourself from notes that have been shared with you. 
Just tap the three vertical dots on any note to bring up the relevant menu. 
The same menu lets you make a copy of the note. 
If you created the note you also have the option to kick people off -- tap the user icon button then the cross next to the relevant name. 
Google has also added better sorting options for Keep in the latest update. 
Tap the search icon on the Android app or click inside the search box on the Web and you 'll see the share icon again. 
Select it to show only those notes that are shared with other people. 
If you have a pile of colored notes to pick through then this feature is going to become more and more useful you can also filter by note color or type. 
Houseboats are inarguably the awesomest kind of house. 
But whereas most conventional houseboats are little more than bungalows mounted atop barges, the new Flash Cat 67SC offers a posh alternative. 
Built by the Spanish shipwrights at Flash Cartamaran, the 67SC measures 65 feet in length with a 27 foot beam. 
Yes, technically, it is a catamaran but not one like you 've ever seen before. 
It's far closer to a self-powered houseboat than a luxury yacht as the entire cabin has been raised from below deck to create, essentially, a floating two story condo. 
The ship's interior can be split into as many as six separate cabins -- including a 65 square foot master bed and bath -- and includes both a full kitchen and dining space for up to 12 guests. 
The 67SC will be powered by a pair of 500 HP diesel motors embedded in each catamaran sled. 
There's no word what toll this ship could take on your wallet but seeing as how they're built to order and pricing is only available on request, you probably can't afford it. 
Still, it can't possibly be pricier than the Fennel Residence.

We're still learning a ton about smartwatches, from using them as fitness wearables to baby monitor alert devices. 
So we want to know: what do you use your smartwatch for? 
We 've discussed smartwatch capabilities before, but they're still new and in rapid development. 
Do you own one? 
What do you really love about it? 
Do you just use yours for day-to-day tasks like reminders and text messaging, or have you gotten creative and started to integrate it with your smart home hardware? 
We want to know what you love about your smartwatch. 
Actually, the company has been expanding beyond comments for a while. 
It launched its StreamHub product, which included more social media widgets, back in 2012. 
And it acquired social media curation startup Storify last year. 
But the company is taking another big step in this direction with the relaunch of its core platform, which it's now calling Livefyre Studio. 
The idea, basically, is to allow online publishers whether they're news organizations or brand marketers to gather user generated content from anywhere online, and then to republish it anywhere in turn. 
In some ways, it's similar to what Storify already does, but it sounds like the aim here is to provide that kind of social media curation on a bigger scale, with more automation, and often for more marketing-centric uses. 
This could also turn Livefyre into more of a competitor for startups like Chute and Percolate. 
In a quick demo, founder and CEO Jordan Kretchmer showed me how a customer could search for different types of content on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and across the web ; hand-select the content or set up rules for automated gathering and filtering ; then publish it to a customized media wall on their own site, their mobile apps, or in an ad. 
The search part, by the way, is powered by Storify -- Kretchmer said it's the first integration of Storify into the main Livefyre platform. 
The company has actually been testing the platform for months, Kretchmer said, and it went live for all customers last week. 
For example, it was used to create Sony's Greatness Awaits page highlighting content from the PlayStation 4 community, as well as Unilever's sustainability initiative Project Sunlight. 
But judging from our conversation, as well as Kretchmer's blog post announcing Livefyre Studio which does mention comments, if only very briefly, the emphasis seems to be pretty clearly on the marketing side. 
In fact, Kretchmer told me that in the past year brands have grown from to 0 to 30 percent of Livefyre's revenue. 
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice quoted by The Guardian said: Public protection is our first priority. 
Only prisoners who pass a strict risk assessment can be released on HDC. 
Offenders on HDC are subject to strict licence conditions and can be recalled to prison if they breach them. 
The revelations forced Coulson to resign as Prime Minister David Cameron's communications director. 
At the subsequent trial, Coulson was found guilty while his former boss, Rebekah Brooks, was cleared. 
The turducken -- a whole chicken stuffed inside a whole duck stuffed inside a whole turkey, all boneless -- is a relatively recent culinary phenomenon. 
Though popularized in the last 20 years with the help of Louisiana's Chef Paul Prudhomme and John Madden, who brought one to a football game broadcast in 1997, the turducken actually builds on a long tradition of creative bird-into-bird stuffing. 
Alexandre Balthazar Laurent Grimod de la Reynière, the world's first restaurant critic, in 1803 launched the Almanach des Gourmands, what the Paris-based dining historian Carolin Young calls the world's first serial food journal. 
He would edit and publish this best-selling guide to seasonal cooking and restaurants until 1812. 
Like any good publisher, Grimod de la Reynière knew he needed to slide in some extra flair from time to time. 
And in 1807, he put out a recipe for rôti sans pareil, the roast without equal. 
The daredevil-ish recipe calls for a tiny warbler stuffed in a bunting, inserted in a lark, squeezed in a thrush, thrown in a quail, inserted in a lapwing, introduced to a plover, piled into a partridge, wormed into a woodcock, shoehorned into a teal, kicked into a guinea fowl, rammed inside a duck, shoved into a chicken, jammed up in a pheasant, wedged deep inside a goose, logged into a turkey. 
And just when you think a 16-bird roast is probably enough, it's not. 
This meat sphere is finally crammed up into a Great Bustard, an Old World turkey-turned-wrapping paper, for this most epic of poultry meals. 
While there's no record of anyone actually making the rôti sans pareil, Grimod de la Reynière seemingly achieved what is every publisher's goal: capturing generations of eyeballs. 
If you want a visual of the concoction, check out the illustrations that Wired and Vice came up with. 
And it's clear that culinary stunts with meat started long before chefs were grilling steaks with molten lava. 
Take the cockentrice, a half-pig, half-turkey combo that rode the line between mythical beast and gastronomic masterpiece during the reign of Henry VIII in the 16th century. 
It's been recreated by Richard Fitch, the project coordinator for the Historic Kitchens at Hampton Palace, who told Vice that while these dishes certainly weren't the norm, Henry VIII once served a cockentrice and a dolphin to the French King, Francis I. As we 've previously reported, royals of that era went to great lengths for a culinary thrill. 
For those who heart turducken, the demand is high enough that big box stores like Sam's Club and Costco now stock them. 
There's even a vegetarian version, if the stuffing concept floats your boat. 
This morning, Aereo filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11, marking the end of the road for the cloud-based TV startup. 
The company launched in 2012 using micro-antennas and cloud DVR technology to provide near-live TV access to 30 channels to subscribers for as low as $ 8/month. 
We hopped on the phone with CEO and founder Chet Kanojia to discuss the news. 
Check out the full transcript below: 
TechCrunch: It's been about five months since the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the broadcast networks and deemed Aereo illegal. 
What's been going on with Aereo during that time? 
Chet Kanojia: As the law changed, it took us a while to figure out the possible ways that we could look at the future of the company. 
Our team was patient for long enough to figure out which avenue made the most sense, and that took a while to sort. 
There was a lot of interest in figuring out the value of the technology, the partnerships, and the components of the company. 
As we explored more, knowing the toll litigation took and the additional costs, we determined that the right thing to do was to go through Chapter 11 restructuring. 
CK: With the restructuring, we can either recapitalize the technology with a new business plan or sell the assets. 
We 've brought someone on, Lawton Bloom from Argus, to make sure it's a clean and fair and balanced process. 
CK: Everybody is deeply disappointed -- the team, investors, and a lot of consumers. 
Our board obviously helped us come to this decision, after exhausting all possibilities and scenarios and going down every branch of the decision tree to plan the probability of success for each. 
Based on all that, we decided that the restructuring was the best was to make sure our assets are maximized for our shareholders. 
But we're deeply disappointed. 
The court made an incredibly wrong decision, but be that as it may, we can't appeal that decision anymore so it's time to take next steps. 
CK: I think we played an integral role in bringing to the forefront the imbalances of the industry -- the Archaean business models, the lack of focus on consumer interest. 
I think we brought that dialogue even more attention. 
Once a day there's a story in the news about cord cutting. 
There is evidence that around 10 million households are internet only in the United States. 
We didn't create the phenomenon, but we rose to fill that opportunity. 
It's inevitable that we 'll get there. 
Even now you can see CBS and HBO making moves in this direction, but those are just band aids. 
Aereo was positioned in the same place that we 'll find the TV industry in the next five to seven years. 
CK: Hindsight is always 20/20. 
I'd go back and look at all the decisions we made, and very honestly, I think we executed flawlessly. 
There isn't much we could have done to avoid this other than not starting Aereo, and starting this company is something I'd never regret. 
I learned to create something that touched a chord in people, so there are few regrets on that front. 
Would we tweak one or two percent of the decisions? 
Sure, but in entirety our decision-making was pitch perfect. 
We were a startup taking on a $ 130 billion + industry, and I think we executed flawlessly. 
I go back and ask the investors and the board and everyone's consensus, the resounding verdict, has been that our decisions were made carefully and cautiously. 
We were taking on a big idea and a big risk and everyone understood that. 
We were willing to take those risks to chase the dream. 
It's inevitable that cord cutting is going to happen. 
There are immediate opportunities and there are even bigger opportunities in the future to serve consumer need, and that won't come from incumbents. 
Their business model won't permit it. 
People have to make their own assessments, but there is a lot of innovation in the space, which is exciting. 
I look at Aereo as a huge success on a lot of different fronts. 
The financial outcome might not have been a success, but that is just one piece. 
We raised the dialogue around the problems in the industry, creating a great product that connected consumers to incredible technology. 
And we did it with a great team. 
If you measure us by any of those standards, we're a success. 
The financial outcome is just one aspect. 
CK: Right now I have to see Aereo to its last conclusion, so that's the focus right now. 
But people like me have a hard time setting things down. 
Let me get one thing clear: I am fascinated by Uber, as a business, as a service, as a model for the modern economy, and even as a force for racial justice more on that some other time. 
But it's increasingly clear that the fast-growing ride-hailing service is what economists would call a natural monopoly, with commensurate profitability. 
Should the windfall really all go to Travis Kalanick and the investors who are now putting a $ 30bn valuation on the company? 
It's inevitable that one ride-sharing service will dominate in each major metropolitan area. 
Neither passengers nor drivers want to maintain accounts with multiple services. 
The latest numbers on Travis Kalanick's company, obtained by Business Insider, show a business likely to bring in nearly $ 1bn a month by this time next year, far ahead of any competitor. 
Uber sometimes looks like Microsoft at its most aggressive under Bill Gates, not simply content to out-compete, but determined to crush the opposition. 
Uber has not only sabotaged competitors on the roads ; it is starving funding for companies like Lyft, barring investors who place multiple bets in the ride-sharing sector. 
In short, Uber not only has the economic characteristics of a monopoly, but the arrogance that goes with such market dominance. 
And that arrogance has created the political conditions for anti-trust action. 
I don't believe you can enforce competition in the ride-sharing market, at least not without sacrificing some of the efficiency brought by a single dominant exchange. 
But cities such as New York could choose which ride-sharing service to license: in other words, it could select the winner of this natural monopoly, capture some of the efficiency gains and share with the losers in this technological transition. 
So here's a modest suggestion: treat the city's roads like a traditional public utility, or a public resource like cell spectrum. 
Invite Uber, Lyft and other ride-sharing companies to tender for a license as the city's preferred ride-sharing service. 
Let them compete to show how they 'll treat drivers and riders fairly, in their terms and conditions ; and let them bid for the right to this future profit stream. 
The proceeds, which would be substantial, could go to support the market in taxi medallions, compensating some of those most resistant to technological change. 
Public transportation, for those who can't afford Uber rides, would also be a beneficiary. 
I have no problem with Travis Kalanick getting rich. 
His execution has been admirably ruthless. 
But he and his investors won't be able to keep all the monopoly profits without a political backlash: litigation ; strikes ; and more horrific press coverage. 
A calmer distribution of the efficiency gains, with bids set in a competitive city-wide tender, is preferable. 
You can always expect that Amazon will push out new Kindles and Fires year by year, but the Everything Store has so much more in the works. 
From travel sites to retail stores, there's a whole bunch of rumored stuff Bezos & Co. might be getting ready to roll out. 
Here's a breakdown. 
Ad-supported and dirt cheap has always been a cornerstone of Amazon's Kindle hardware strategy, and rumor has it that same tactic is coming to its Instant Video service. 
The rumored Amazon streaming offering would operate completely independently of the $ 100-per-yer Amazon Prime, and come in at a price around $ 8 a month to undercut competitors like Netflix and Hulu. 
The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon was considering the possibility in March, and now the New York Post cites sources that confirm it's a done deal. 
It also makes perfect sense, given that Amazon's already applied this model to ebooks with Kindle Unlimited. 
A report from travel site Skift says that Amazon is working with a number of hotels to launch its own travel site for hotel bookings as early as January of next year. 
The plan is apparently to start simple: Hotels in the New York, Los Angeles and Seattle areas would list rooms, availability, pricing, and photos on Amazon's new site, and then kick Amazon 15 percent of every transaction. 
Rumors that Amazon would eventually open up some sort of physical store somewhere have been floating around for years, but they 've really heated up lately. 
The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon would open a retail store in NYC during the 2014 holiday season. 
The rumored store would function half as a warehouse -- acting as a staging area for same-day deliveries in New York City -- and half as a traditional sort of retail store, accepting in-person returns, and peddling Amazon's growing family of e-readers, tablets, set-top boxes, talking speaker, and phone. 
Since the initial reports, Amazon has ponied up to lease a 470,000 square foot space in Midtown Manhattan for 17 years. 
Amazon has so far deflected any suggestions that this might be the makings of a physical store, claiming this is just office space, and the retail space on the ground floor will be leased out. 
But sources are still telling the WSJ that the warehouse-storefront combo plan is still a go. 
Amazon's plan to use drones to deliver packages is anything but a secret. 
It's also mostly marketing and damned unfeasible for the moment. 
But in the meantime, Amazon is rumored to be exploring other equally-weird but more realistic solutions for faster shipping. 
One of these includes using taxi services to ferry deliveries to customers in San Francisco and Los Angeles. 
And that's on top of persistent rumors that Amazon is also laying the groundwork for a more traditional delivery service that would compete with UPS and FedEx. 
Even though there aren't any specific rumors yet, there's also a whole bunch of other things that Amazon almost certainly has in the works. 
Of course Amazon is working on a new line of Kindle e-readers. 
The Kindle Fire HDX line is about due for a meaningful update. 
Amazon surely hasn't given up on the Fire Phone. 
Amazon's Fire TV and Fire Stick are still pretty new, but there's a good chance they have successors already in planning, not to mention that Amazon still owns a game studio that it could still put to a lot more use. 
And Amazon is clearly ramping up its cloud game if it's offering unlimited photo storage to all its Prime members. 
And let's not forget Amazon Echo. 
Amazon's Prime offerings have been getting better and better and better, but it looks like that's only part -- if a big part -- of the once-bookseller's plans to take over every part of your world. 
Only time will tell how many of these whisperings come true, but there's pretty much no question that Amazon has a whole flock of crazy ideas in the works. 
It's just a matter of which one shows up first. 
The only contact she could stand -- one of the few ways I could share my love with her -- was for me to rub her feet. 
As I stood at the foot of her hospital bed doing just that, a scrub-clad figure we had never seen before poked her head in the door, curled her lip and demanded: What is your relationship? 
The question was clearly directed at me, but my girlfriend reached through her drug-induced, hypoxic haze to respond with her New Yorker tough-girl attitude: Really? 
Whose feet do you rub like this? 
What the hell are you, the relationship police? 
Although a curled lip seems to be the universal sign for You disgust me, we weren't at all sure that the question was motivated by homophobia. 
Scrub-clad figures poking their heads into hospital rooms and asking random questions without so much as a word of introduction isn't a problem just for people in the LGBT community. 
If you 've been hospitalized, you 've probably had a similar experience. 
But LGBT people have been so systematically discriminated against, misunderstood, and at best ignored within the health system that when we walk into a practitioner's office or a hospital room we don't assume that we're starting at neutral in the interaction, because we know better. 
Consider the stories just within my social circle: 
But even though the federal government just recently admitted oops, yeah, we should have been keeping data on you people, we do know that significant health disparities exist: lesbian and bisexual women are less able to get health care due to cost ; gay men, especially gay men of color, are still disproportionately at risk of HIV/AIDS. 
Bisexual women have lower rates of appropriate breast cancer screening and cervical cancer screening than straight women or lesbians. 
In a recent study from Massachusetts, one in five transgender/gender non-conforming respondents reported postponing or not using health care in the previous year because of prior experiences of mistreatment in health care settings. 
It would take the systematic dismantling of entrenched societal, institutional and familial homophobia, biphobia and transphobia in order to completely address the health disparities that the LGBT community faces, which I suppose is a bit of a tall order for a Friday afternoon. 
So the American Association of Medical College's report earlier this month urging integration of culturally competent LGBT health care across the med school curriculum is a great start. 
While this is an important safety concern, especially for people of trans experience, many people experience discomfort using their legal name. 
My grandma cringed at hearing her given name Viola while in the hospital, rather than the name she was known as at home. 
Though after she had a beloved grandchild named after her she didn't mind so much. 
And even beyond being inclusive, isn't Who do you have to support you? 
a much more relevant question in health care than asking what kind of romantic partnership a patient is involved in? 
When the uninformed wonder why LGBT people need special health care with lines such as Is there such a thing as a lesbian knee? 
, they 've misunderstood not so much the LGBT community but the nature of health care.

Google is going hard after Christmas bargain shoppers. 
The company is offering 1 TB of free storage space for two years for people who buy new Chromebooks between now and the end of the year. 
The free storage lasts two years. 
Normally, Google charges $ 10 a month for 1 TB, which means you 'll get $ 240 worth of storage, and some of the eligible computers only cost $ 199. 
Not a bad deal. 
It's a sad day for Aereo and all those who believed in it. 
The startup, which allowed people to stream live broadcast television to their computers and mobile devices, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, just months after shutting down operations. 
The news, which Aereo founder and CEO Chet Kanojia announced on the company blog on Friday, marks the end of an era for the embattled startup, which faced opposition from major broadcasters ever since Aereo launched in 2012. 
Like Uber and Airbnb, Aereo has been one of those companies that bucked regulation from the outset. 
Inside the infrastructure that drove its online service, it assigned every Aereo user a mini broadcast TV antenna, and it used this to argue that its service was no different than sticking a pair of bunny ears on your television. 
That way, Aereo could avoid paying retransmission fees for broadcasters' content. 
But broadcasters never bought this argument, and when it came down to it, neither did the Supreme Court. 
In June, Aereo shut down operations indefinitely. 
Now, Kanojia says the company is filing for bankruptcy to avoid the extensive cost and distraction of defending drawn out litigation in several courts. 
We have traveled a long and challenging road, he wrote. 
We stayed true to our mission and we believe that we have played a significant part in pushing the conversation forward, helping force positive change in the industry for consumers. 
Indeed, Aereo has been a force for change in this industry. 
Just last month, one of Aereo's biggest adversaries, CBS, announced the launch of CBS All Access, a subscription service that allows people to stream CBS content online for just $ 5.99 a month. 
A few days before that, HBO announced its own standalone streaming service, which won't require a cable subscription. 
Internet television will live on, though only on the terms of existing content companies -- at least for the moment. 
This may come at the cost of consumers. 
Though many cord cutters have argued that cable packages are a ripoff and feel they should only have to pay for the content they actually watch, they're also coming to realize that paying small sums of money to lots of different content providers is going to add up. 
But even if Aereo's time is over, there may be space for a similar service in the future, as the FCC looks to redefine its regulations about who can and can not retransmit broadcast television. 
Last month, FCC chairman Tom Wheeler proposed a new rule that would allow internet TV providers to license content just like cable and satellite companies do. 
Wheeler acknowledged that Aereo has played a key role in changing the Commission's thinking. 
In a blog post announcing the proposal, Wheeler wrote: Twenty-first century consumers shouldn't be shackled to rules that only recognize 20th century technology. 
Working with two other researchers at Harvard University, Rubenstein recently created what they call AERobot, a bot that can help teach programming and artificial intelligence to middle school kids and high schoolers. 
That may seem like a rather expensive luxury for most schools, but it's not. 
It costs just $ 10.70. 
The hope is that it can help push more kids into STEM, studies involving science, technology, engineering, and math. 
The tool is part of a widespread effort to teach programming and other computer skills to more children, at earlier stages. 
It's called the code literacy movement, and it includes everything from new and simpler programming languages to children's books that teach coding concepts. 
Rubenstein's project grew out of the 2014 AFRON Challenge, held back in January, which called for researchers to design low-cost robotic systems for education in the developing world. 
Part of Harvard's Self-Organizing Systems Research Group, Rubstein has long studied swarm robotics, which aims to create herds of tiny robots that can behave as whole, and he ended up adapting one of his swarm systems in order to build AERobot. 
It's a single machine -- not a swarm bot -- but it's built from many of the same inexpensive materials. 
He and his colleagues assembled most of the electronics with a pick-and-place machine -- a machine that automatically builds printed circuit boards -- and in order to further cut costs, they used vibration motors for locomotion and left out a chassis. 
The device doesn't include its own programming interface or charger. 
It gets both from a desktop or laptop computer, plugging into the USB port. 
There are no extra frills, Rubenstein says. 
On the software side, Rubenstein modified a programming language called minibloqs, a highly graphical means of programming machines. 
You don't really need to type code. 
You drag pictures, he explains. 
Say I wanted an LED on the robot to turn green. 
I would just drag over an image of an LED, and pick the green color. 
The language, he says, is a bit like Scratch, the programming language for kids developed at MIT. 
The bot can move forwards and backwards on flat surfaces, turn in place, detect light, follow lines and edges, and identify distances using reflected infrared light. 
And the idea is that kids will learn but programming the bot to do such things. 
Rubenstein and his team provide a fifteen-lesson curriculum that walks students through the sensors and the actuators, the programming flow and logic, and how to create specific robot behavior. 
At the 2014 AFRON Challenge, AERobot won the top honor in the software category, and it took second place in the hardware and curriculum categories. 
The team has since tested it with about 100 sixth - to eighth - graders at a STEM-focused summer camp called i2Camp, and they plan to do further tests this coming summer. 
Rubenstein says that for the bot's next iteration, the group is focusing on improving the curriculum and the software, eliminating steps in the installation process and ensuring AERobot is so simple that kids can learn how to use the thing on their own -- without a teacher. 
It's been a long week, and everyone is jonesing for that Thanksgiving break to put on their fattest pants and slip into football/food/movie comas. 
So we 'll keep it simple. 
Here's a GIF of Benedict Cumberbatch being flirty with you, and the week's most noteworthy television. 
I guess this would be the wrong time to ask you to marry me. 
But if not now, when? 
Jost/Jones has to be one of the best odd couples on TV. 
Not because they have especially good chemistry on camera, but because their anti-chemistry is so compelling. 
Leslie just walks all over him, but Colin is the perfect little milquetoast fall guy. 
There's a tiny hint of fear in his eyes each time they appear together at the Weekend Update desk, like he has no real idea how things will go down when Jones lets loose. 
But one thing is for sure: Upgrading her to full-fledged player is one of our favorite SNL casting decisions in a long time. 
Honestly, Jessica Chastain just seems like one of the sweetest, classiest people in Hollywood. 
And she's like best friends with her grandma, too. 
So here is Jessica Chastain being the loveliest person ever, if you're interested. 
Whether or not like you pop music, you must respect that Jessie J performs it very well. 
She's best known for her minor hits Domino and Price Tag from her debut album Who Are You, but that dropped all the way back in 2011, and it's only with her third studio release, Sweet Talker, that the British soul-pop firecracker has gotten substantial traction beyond people saying Oh, so that's not Katy Perry ?! 
No. 
It is not. 
Ms. J has been on the verge of breakout for years now, and we're hoping her phenomenal stage presence and killer voice are enough to make her a certified Top 40 sensation. 
She's earned a step out of the wings and into the spotlight. 
Here's a test: Just try and keep up with Russell Brand. 
We're on like our third watch and still missing jokes in the flurry of speech.

When Ayan Qureshi said goodbye to his dad and walked into a Birmingham, England conference center, he was just another five-year-old. 
But when we walked out, two hours later, he was something else: a five-year-old officially qualified to install and configure Microsoft's Windows operating system. 
Ayan Qureshi perhaps the youngest ever Microsoft Certified Professional. 
That means he knows how to do things like encrypt a removable drive using Microsoft's Bitlocker encryption software or troubleshoot Internet Explorer bugs. 
The 1990s-tinged certification test he took inside that conference center is still de rigeur for many corporate and government jobs. 
Microsoft calls these tests rigorous, industry-proven, and industry-recognized exams. 
But for Ayan -- who scored 700 out of 1,000 on the test, the minimum score required to pass -- it was a fun thing to do in between swimming and playing tag with his brother. 
Ayan, who turned six shortly after his September 24 exam, started getting into computers about three years ago. 
He used to sit next to me and watch me very carefully, says his dad, Asim Qureshi, who also works in IT. 
So Asim started explaining the basics to his son: how to turn a computer on, how to power down, how to access the control panel. 
Before he knew it, Asim had built his son a mini computer-lab in his home office, and Ayan was spending one-to-two hours per day playing around with the operating system. 
While other kids were playing video games and watching TV, Ayan was installing and configuring operating systems and tinkering with routers and switches. 
This is not every kid's idea of fun, but Ayan is different. 
I knew that if I introduced him to the games, he would not go for this, his dad says. 
We checked with Microsoft, and they couldn't tell us if anyone younger has ever been Microsoft-certified. 
Still, it's hard to imagine anyone younger than five reading through the dull Microsoft manuals and practicing the test multiple-choice questions you need in order to make the grade. 
It's not easy to pass the test, says Asim Qureshi. 
We couldn't get an interview with Ayan -- his dad says his son has been overwhelmed by the U.K. media's coverage of his accomplishment -- but the kid told The Independent that he wants to be an IT consultant or a mathematician when he grows up. 
In addition to the Microsoft Command Prompt, he likes remote controlled toys, digital cameras, and science. 
I like compasses and telescopes, but I really like prisms,: he told the paper. 
The rainbow colored light reflected through the prism is amazing. 
Although he's now a Certified Professional, it's still going to be awhile before Ayan puts his skills on the market. 
At the moment, he's just concentrating on his school, says Asim Qureshi. 
But he also will be improving his IT skills.

Alan Turing may be the star of The Imitation Game, but the truly central figure in the film is Christopher. 
Named after Turing's childhood friend and first love, the machine not only breaks the German Enigma code during World War II, but also becomes a forbear to nearly every computer out there including the one you're reading this on. 
The real Christopher was named the Bombe later Victory and although the filmmakers took some liberties in naming their device, they went to great lengths to make sure it looked as much like Turing's revolutionary computer as possible. 
The letter-covered rotors, the wires, the dozens of ports -- it's all there. 
However, production designer Maria Djurkovic Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy did make it open-able so the audience could see its impressive construction. 
She also ran more red wires into the machine, so as to give it the appearance that it has nerves -- and blood running through its veins. 
The actual design is absolutely based on the reality of it, Djurkovic says. 
You extrapolate -- you have to make something that's credible, you have to make something where those cogs turn at different speeds and it effectively has to be doing what the Bombe was doing. 
What's even more impressive is that she was able to build the machine for # 30,000 about $ 48,000. 
The film had a mere $ 15 million budget so it was a lean build -- and cheaper than the one in the film, which Turing Benedict Cumberbatch says will cost him about # 100,000 to make -- and what Djurkovic crafted holds up well to scrutiny. 
So well, in fact, her Christopher has been given a home at Bletchley Park, the UK compound where Turing and his fellow code-breakers created the original Bombe. 
It 'll be on exhibit at Bletchley for a year starting this month. 
Here's how she did it. 
Bletchley Park has a replica of Alan Turing's code-breaking machine, but the filmmakers couldn't exactly borrow it and let Benedict Cumberbatch play with it. 
So Djurkovic and director Morton Tyldum went to Bletchley, which is now a tourist attraction, to figure out how to recreate one. 
They also brought supervising art director Nick Dent, who took photos and measurements of the machine. 
The Christopher replica ended up being a foot or two taller than the original. 
After seeing Turing's machine, Djurkovic and company decided they wanted to make one that could be opened up so audiences could see just how intricate the design was. 
We sort of wandered around this thing 360 degrees and stood at the back of it saying ` This is actually much more interesting -- the nerve center of the machine,' she says. 
There and then we decided we would build it into two sections and split it. 
Designing Christopher required a bit of actual engineering. 
To do so, Dent drew his design in Illustrator using a CAD plug-in. 
It turns Illustrator into a technical drawing package but retains the artistic and visual qualities that the original package allows, Djurkovic says, citing Dent's explanation. 
Rather than AutoCAD or Vectorworks, which doesn't allow for texture or light to be included. 
Click through the slideshow above for Dent's illustrations of Christopher. 
After it was designed, the art department had just a few weeks to build Christopher before filming. 
Djurkovic estimates it took her team -- a collection of staffers and interns -- about five weeks working in three-person teams to finish the Bombe. 
We do everything insanely quickly. 
When I look back on a film after I finish I just think, ` How the bloody hell did we actually do that?' 
she says. 
It's not just Christopher, it's every single aspect of the film. 
Like most movies, The Imitation Game was shot out of order ; that meant that Christopher had to be able to look like it was in different stages of completion. 
It's this business of having to in-build the ability to pull it apart, Djurkovic says. 
You don't know how it's going to work in the schedule, if you're starting with it finished or starting with it in the middle stage. 
You have to adapt. 
Djurkovic's replica looks very close to the real McCoy, but it lacks one important feature: It can't actually crack any codes. 
Oh, no, no, no. 
Absolutely not! 
she laughs when asked if her Bombe can do any calculations. 
The sum total of its mechanism was that its wheels turned in a sequence similar to the real thing. 
The Imitation Game jumps back and forth in time from Turing's time code-breaking in World War II to his childhood to his life in Manchester right before his death. 
Those scenes from his later years show him tinkering with a Christopher-like device. 
The truth is a bit different. 
That machine wasn't in Turing's home, it was at the University of Manchester. 
And it didn't look as much like the Bombe as the one in the film. 
That one was much less closer to the reality, because Morton wanted it to echo Christopher, Djurkovic says. 
He wanted there to be a visual echo so we departed from reality. 
But, she adds, a lot of the other details in his home were accurate. 
Everything that you see on the walls of that Manchester house at the start of the film, that's not some whim of mine. 
That's based on absolutely the kind of things he was studying at that period of his life. 
Big engines like the 707-horsepower monster Dodge put in the Challenger Hellcat or Volvo's little four-cylinder that makes 425 ponies get all the attention these days. 
But there are millions of tiny engines doing tiny things think garden trimmers, leaf blowers, that sort of thing that we never give much thought to. 
But just as there are engineers pondering how to make big engines more powerful, so too are there engineers pondering how to make tiny engines more powerful. 
Some of those engineers work at the engine development firm LiquidPiston, which has created a 70cc pistonless rotary engine that it expects to produce five horsepower at an astounding 15,000 RPM -- in a package 30 percent smaller than a similar piston engines. 
Now, five horsepower doesn't sound like a lot, but it's more than adequate for the applications such an engine might be used in. 
And further refinement of the prototype could, of course, bring more power. 
LiquidPiston calls the new engine the X Mini. 
It can run on diesel fuel or spark-fired gasoline like the engine in your car. 
Because so many potential applications are in the lawn care and landscaping biz, the current design runs on a mix of gasoline and oil for lubrication. 
The engine is similar to the Wankel engine Mazda used for years in the RX-series sports car. 
It has just two moving parts: a rotor and a shaft to transfer power from the engine. 
Minimal moving parts means the engine is smaller, lighter, more reliable and quieter than a conventional piston-fired engine. 
It's also smoother, which, if you 've ever used a weed whacker or leaf blower, you 'll consider a big plus. 
So what's a pistonless rotary engine, you ask? 
In a conventional four-stroke reciprocating piston engine, the piston moves within a cylinder. 
Air and fuel are drawn in with a downstroke and compressed in an upstroke. 
The mixture is detonated as the piston reaches the top of the cylinder ; the explosion forces the piston down, creating power. 
Exhaust gasses are expelled on the following upstroke, and the process begins anew. 
A Wankel pistonless rotary engine has a rotor that looks like a rounded triangle, a shape called an epitrochoid. 
It rotates in an eccentric orbit within an oval chamber ; each rotation results in three power strokes. 
The big advantage of a pistonless rotary engine is its high power to weight ratio, reduced weight, and simplicity. 
LiquidPiston riffed on the Wankel design and uses an oval rotor that spins within an epitrochoid chamber. 
The company claims its design -- one of 60 it says it has patented -- improves upon the Wankel to create a more durable engine. 
The engine, which is 95 percent aluminum, uses a pair of counterbalancers to minimize vibration. 
LiquidPiston claims it is two orders of magnitude smoother than a conventional engine. 
Such an engine could see use in everything from scooters to drones, but LiquidPiston is focusing on the lawn and garden market -- even if it has no plans to actually build engines. 
We're not looking to manufacture engines, says company president Alexander Shkolnik. 
Instead, the company plans to continue developing the engine and work with a manufacturing partner to tailor it to a particular application, perhaps a chain saw or leaf blower. 
Shkolnik presented a paper on the new engine this week at the SAE/JSAE 2014 Small Engine Technology Conference & Exhibition in Italy. 
Next year, the company plans a contest to solicit ideas for how the engine might best be used. 
A lot of the major risks have been addressed, Shkolnik says.

The statistics are staggering: Researchers predict that by 2025, the world will have 37 megacities, defined as urban areas with more than 10 million people. 
New York City and Newark are expected to have more than 23 million inhabitants ; Tokyo, more than 38 million people. 
All told, well over half of the world's population will be living in these super settlements. 
One number that isn't referenced often is that two-thirds of that population will be poor, says Pedro Gadanho, who curated Uneven Growth: Tactical Urbanisms for Growing Megacities at MoMA. 
That poverty translates into informal cities, like the favelas of Rio de Janeiro or illegally subdivided high-rises of Hong Kong. 
What Gadanho, and MoMA, want to explore is: How can urban planners work with these urban residents, not against them, to make cities more livable for everyone? 
There are myriad factors to consider: When rising tides encroach on millions of residences, will those families lose their homes? 
If many of the 8 billion people in the world don't have access to proper healthcare, how can architects promote healthy living environments? 
Gadanho invited six teams of architects, urban planners, and researchers to propose tactical urbanisms, or urban planning solutions that draw on existing and not always legal infrastructure and patterns in human settlement. 
Each team spent 14 months on scenarios for one of six cities: New York, Rio de Janeiro, Mumbai, Lagos, Hong Kong, and Istanbul. 
Each city is growing rapidly, and each has tremendous inequality. 
The teams were selected based on their work and methodology. 
I cherry picked practices that were already on the terrain, doing their own take on the idea of tactical urbanism. 
So they were already working with committees, researching how people were appropriating space, and proposing models for a different kind of city, Gadanho says. 
Many of these proposals are based on the idea that top-down planning has been failing people in many aspects. 
In scale and ambition, the results run the gamut. 
For instance, 85 percent of Hong Kong is surrounded by water, yet the city's population is expected swell by 50 percent. 
MAP Office, Hong Kong Network Architecture Lab, and New York's Columbia University reasoned that with so little land, the city has three options: develop sanctioned natural parks, extended the shoreline further into the water, or building artificial islands near the coastline. 
They ultimately proposed building eight new islands, each dedicated to an economic or social activity unique to Hong Kong, like fishing. 
Naturally, building these would create jobs. 
In Istanbul, housing development in the 1970s led to a city where the middle class mostly inhabits TOKI buildings, or clusters of towers in gated communities. 
For the people of Istanbul, acquiring a TOKI apartment is part of a middle class dream, one that also includes owning a car, and the latest gadgets. 
As Superpool and Istanbul Atelier d’Architecture Autogérée see it, that consumer-driven culture could soon become a society in debt. 
They propose a new kind of utopia, where the TOKI clusters get retrofitted with micro-farms, solar panels, and shared car services. 
Called R-Urban, the services would be open-source and connected through a series of apps. 
It builds a sharing economy layer on top of the TOKI clusters, which reinforces, rather than destroys, the sense of community that drew inhabitants there in the first place. 
After 14 months of gestation, each project is still highly hypothetical and probably only viable under a certain set of circumstances, like municipal cooperation, or the availability of funds for construction. 
They're all pie-in-the-sky utopian ideals. 
In that light, the exhibit is a mental exercise, one that considers how to build according to what people are already doing. 
Governments might want to eradicate favela housing, because they can't control it, but that improvisational style of living exists in part because of the skills and community values that already live in a city. 
That's an opportunity, not an obstacle. 
Great looking hardware. 
Snappy processor and plenty of RAM make the Z3 a speed demon. 
Shoots 4K video. 
Waterproof up to 5 feet. 
Glass back makes it a fingerprint magnet -- and a slippery one at that. 
I dropped and shattered mine. 
Finicky camera produces inconsistent photos. 
Stability issues aplenty. 
Mystifying software choices, including pointless redesigns of great stock Android apps. 
Sony has an Android problem. 
For years now the consumer electronics giant has been making some truly head-turning hardware loaded with Google's mobile OS. 
When it comes to actually using the hardware, though, things almost always go south. 
It seems Sony just can't help itself from making the same mistakes over and over. 
The Xperia Z3 is its latest almost-great phone. 
On paper, the it looks like a gem. 
You 've got a 5.2-inch 1080p display 424 ppi, a 20.7-megapixel camera capable of shooting 4K video, Qualcomm's super-quick 2.5 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor, not two but three gigabytes of RAM, a 3100mAh battery, dual front-facing speakers, and sure, what the hell, let's make it waterproof to a depth of 5 feet for up to half an hour, too. 
There aren't many phones out there with a rap sheet as bad as that. 
With the screen off, it looks like a polished black slab -- both front and back. 
Around the sides is a solid, gently rounded aluminum chassis. 
Up top is a headphone jack yes, it's waterproof. 
On the right-hand side, you 'll find the door covering the micro SD card slot, the silver power button, the volume rocker, and lastly, the physical shutter button for the camera. 
All phones should have a physical shutter button. 
When it comes to speed, you won't have any complaints. 
Sony went through a long phase where it used great processors, but bad software slowed everything down. 
That seems to be one thing they 've solved because this thing absolutely screams. 
I don't see any hesitation while flipping between home screens, app and folders fly open, and everything seems to move as fast as your finger. 
As for sights and sounds, the screen is very bright and I almost never had any difficulty reading it outdoors. 
The colors are rich, too. 
The Z3 doesn't have those super inky blacks that we love on AMOLED displays, though, and at times it looks a bit gray and flat. 
I was excited about the dual front-facing speakers a la the HTC One M8, but while they're fairly loud and nice for gaming, they're not very clear. 
Music sounds distorted and unbalanced, and things can be grating at full volume. 
In contrast, both the HTC One M8 and the new Moto X which only has one true front-facing speaker are louder and better sounding. 
The camera is finicky too. 
Sometimes, when there's enough light, it produces rich, vivid, and sharp photos that absolutely make you salivate. 
Two seconds later, you can take almost the exact same shot, and it 'll be washed out with bland colors. 
The camera app isn't particularly user-friendly, either. 
Settings seem to be placed at random within the menu, and you can't access most of them until you change out of auto mode. 
Speaking of camera modes, there are over a dozen, although they take the form of camera apps. 
That's where you 'll find useful things like 4K video stashed among other generally useless apps like AR Fun, which overlays dinosaurs and elves onto whatever you're pointing your camera at. 
Battery life is generally solid, too. 
Sony claims that it has two day battery life. 
I definitely never saw it get anywhere close to that the most I ever got was 30 hours, but I'm a heavy user. 
I will say that most of the time made it well past bedtime without needing a charge, except for when it didn't. 
And here's where things started getting weird. 
It seems that there's got to be a runaway bit of code somewhere in the device, but I have no idea what triggers it. 
There are days where it seems this phone will never run out of batteries, and then there are days when I notice the phone is running hot and I find myself looking for a charger before 6pm. 
As far as I can tell, I'm using the phone roughly the same amount, so something must be wrong in there. 
Ultimately, even though the software doesn't cause many slowdowns, it's still what keeps this from being a great phone. 
When you compare the UI i.e. the skin Sony puts on top of Android to the minimal UI that Motorola is using, or to stock Android, it looks like a convoluted mess. 
For proof, just look at my notification panel. 
All of those are from pre-installed software that came with this phone. 
Do you see what's not there? 
My actual notifications, like for email and text messages. 
I had to scroll down to find them. 
Even when there are fewer things on there, it's still tough to find what you're looking for because it gets so cluttered. 
The apps Sony decides for some reason to redo on their own -- like the very good stock Android Calendar -- universally get worse as well. 
This is true for the dialer, where the UI has no sense of flow, and the app drawer, where they add a layers of complication to something as simple as adding an app to your desktop. 
It seems Sony has too much ego caught up in the game and just can't get out of its own way. 
There are stability issues, too. 
I got an error message after I hadn't been using my phone, pulled it out, and took five photos. 
I also get a lot of apps randomly crashing. 
Sometimes, everything you open instantly crashes, and you have to restart the phone. 
It's these layers of annoyance and complication that make it very hard to recommend the Z3 to John and Jane Q Public. 
So once again we're left with an all too familiar story. 
The Z3 is ostensibly a phone with a lot going for it. 
It's a phone I actually really want to love. 
But once again, the flaws are simply too sizable and numerous to recommend it in good conscience. 
Here's to hoping that story will finally change next time. 
In 16th century Scotland, the alchemist John Damian, who was known to expense a suspicious amount of whiskey in his experiments to find the elusive philosopher's stone, decided he could fly. 
He fashioned a pair of wings from feathers and took off from the lofty battlements of Stirling Castle for a flight to Paris. 
He didn't make it to France, but he did plummet a few feet away from the castle and break a leg. 
The failure, he later claimed, was due to using feathers from chickens, which can't so much fly, when he should have used eagle feathers instead. 
Really, the problem had more to do with mammals like us not being cut out for flight. 
Well, except for bats. 
There are, though, critters like sugar gliders and flying squirrels, which can pull off some pretty solid glides. 
But compared to the adorable and little-known colugo, they got nothin'. 
This is the most accomplished mammalian glider of all -- on account of being essentially a giant flap of skin -- capable of soaring an incredible 200 feet from tree to tree. 
Its expansive membrane, known as a patagium, stretches from its face to the tips of its digits all the way back to its tail, so geometrically, it has the greatest surface area that you can have between those limbs without actually evolving an entire wing like bats did, said conservation biologist Jan Janecka of Duquesne University. 
With such a beautifully evolved body, the colugo, also known misleadingly as a flying lemur more on that later, spends its nights leisurely gliding through the forests of Southeast Asia. 
Their skeletons, while not nearly as frail as those of bats, are thinner and more elongated than that of a squirrel, reducing their weight while increasing their surface area. 
And their huge eyes, Janecka says, gives them not only good night vision, but excellent depth perception -- no insignificant advantage when you're coming in for a hard landing on the trunk of a tree. 
Colugos are such adept gliders that mothers have no problem bringing their babies along for the ride. 
And they 'll do so for quite some time, for their young are born highly underdeveloped. 
They're not as helpless as, say, marsupial young ` uns, which enjoy the comfort of their mother's pouch, but certainly not as developed as most mammals. 
Still, the newborns cling to mom as she sails around the rainforest in search of food, mostly sap and leaves and shoots. 
And as if the colugo's flappy skin weren't bizarre enough, its teeth are shaped like little combs. 
This could be helping them in some way to feed, says Janecka, or may play a part in grooming to snag parasites on their skin. 
That's right. 
Colugos may be brushing their hair with combs built right into their faces. 
Unfortunately, beyond watching mothers sail around with their babies, we don't know much at all about the colugo's social life. 
And efforts to keep them in captivity have largely been for naught. 
Remember that these are creatures used to gliding up to 200 feet, and good luck finding that kind of space in a zoo. 
Basically their enclosures weren't large enough to allow them to glide long distances, said Janecka. 
And because they couldn't glide, they couldn't keep their patagium well maintained and dry enough. 
They developed infections on their skin, perhaps from a fungus, and died. 
Ironically enough, it's too much space in the wild that's threatening some colugo populations. 
Deforestation can strand species in islands of trees, but even if loggers just thin out spots in the forest, it's big trouble for the colugo. 
They're the most accomplished mammalian glider on Earth, sure, but if there's too much space between trees, the colugo runs the risk of sinking right to the ground. 
And as you can see below in the video from National Geographic they strapped a camera to a colugo -- enough said, the creature's extra skin makes it all but worthless when anywhere but the canopy. 
It's an easy target in a habitat packed with predators. 
Because colugos tend to live in isolated habitats and because they insist on emerging only at night, much of what we know about them comes from anecdotal evidence. 
Case in point: colugo doo-doo. 
It ... moves. 
I 've seen some videos of fecal material that they 've dropped where there's so many worms it's actually moving, said Janecka. 
It's squirming around. 
The colugo digestive tract, it seems, has a really, really high parasite load. 
And that whole dynamic, whether it happened to be in a population that has a lot of parasites or it's something that's more normal for the colugos that they 've learned to deal with, that's one of those unknown questions at this point. 
What is abundantly clear is that the colugo has a very long digestive tract, which makes sense for a creature that eats trees. 
That stuff takes a whole lot of time to digest. 
But such long guts could also be acting as a sort of mansions for parasitic worms, which have lots of room to make themselves comfortable. 
Until someone starts studying colugo turds at length, though, we 'll have to leave this one a mystery. 
But thanks to Janecka and his colleagues, we're now confident of this: Colugos are primates' closest living relatives. 
So although flying lemur is a misnomer, both because colugos aren't flying but gliding and they're not a kind of lemur, the name isn't that far off. 
Because they have these adaptations for gliding, originally people sort of threw them in with bats, Janecka said. 
But when they looked at the actual morphology of the skull, there was evidence that they're closely related to primates. 
When Janecka and his colleagues did a genomic analysis of the colugo, this suspicion was confirmed. 
It turns out that around 90 million years ago, at the height of the dinosaurs' reign when mammals were just tiny furballs scurrying about trying not to get stepped on, the colugo's ancestors split off from our primate lineage. 
Some 25 million years later, the dinosaurs' time came to an end, leading to the explosion of mammalian diversity. 
In fairness, though, it's the arthropods and bacteria who really rule the world, not us mammals. 
But they can't do cool things like glide 200 feet or comb themselves with their teeth ... or drop poop that moves on its own.

Know of an animal you want me to write about? 
Are you a scientist studying a bizarre creature? 
Email matthew_simon@wired.com or ping me on Twitter at @mrMattSimon. 
It starts with the larva of the ghost moth -- a caterpillar that lives underground. 
A fungus invades the larva, kills it and consumes the body. 
Just the outer skeleton remains. 
Eventually, a small brown stalk erupts from the dead caterpillar's head. 
In the spring, the pinkie-sized stalk pokes an inch or two from the earth. 
That's when people across the Tibetan Plateau head to the high-alpine meadows to harvest the crazy-looking creature. 
It's not just for the fun of it. 
For centuries, people have believed that the fungus known as yartsa gunbu, literally summer grass, winter worm, is an aphrodisiac. 
According to ancient Tibetan texts, men who eat it are promised the delights of thousands of beautiful women. 
That's why top quality yartsa sells for around $ 2,000 an ounce -- more than the price of gold. 
In China, yartsa is a status symbol. 
And in Tibet, people fight over it. 
They sometimes even kill each other. 
In 2014, a dispute between the local community and a park management committee about the right to collect fees for access to yartsa gunbu led to two deaths. 
Plus there's a risk that the demand will deplete the grasslands and alpine regions of the Tibetan Plateau. 
Any resource of such immense value and key relevance to rural livelihoods as the main cash source runs the risk of being overexploited, says Daniel Winkler, an expert on Himalayan caterpillar fungus. 
In Nubri, village leaders set a date for the start of the harvest. 
In the weeks prior, residents must check in at the community meeting house four times daily. 
The roll call is designed to thwart attempts by any individual to begin collecting earlier than others, the authors say. 
Since the trek to the nearest gathering ground is several hours away, it's nearly impossible to sneak off and dig for yartsa gunbu. 
There's also a heavy fine for those who don't check in. 
While all residents in Nubri have a right to collect yartsa gunbu, each household is required to register any collectors and pay a corresponding tax -- $ 1 for the first member and $ 53 for each additional members. 
That's not just pocket change in a part of the world where the yearly income can range from $ 24 to $ 3,500. 
The tax money funds repairs and services, from fixing the hydroelectric system to hiring a lama to perform an empowerment ritual. 
Local rituals and certain Buddhist beliefs have helped keep the harvest under control. 
Religious decrees prohibit harvesting on certain sacred mountain slopes. 
This creates a natural sanctuary, ensuring that part of the landscape will remain undisturbed and allowing fungal spores to spread for the next season. 
The village of Tsum prohibits outsiders from gathering yartsa gunbu. 
Locals are using the profits from yartsa gunbu sales to build lodges that cater to foreign tourists and also to purchase gold as a way to hold onto their yartsa wealth. 
The money has been invaluable. 
In some cases, it makes up 80 percent of a household's income. 
Tibetans are using the cash to improve their standard of living, and in some cases are reducing dependency on agro-pastoral activities by becoming entrepreneurs, Childs and Choedup write. 
Profits pay for everything from school supplies and DVDs to solar panels and gold jewelry. 
But then there's all that tension to deal with. 
One man from the Nubri Valley told Childs and Choedup that Earlier, we only had village meetings once or twice a year. 
Nowadays there are frequent meetings with more arguments between people, more squabbles. 
People are becoming selfish.

Photo-sharing application Memoir, a Timehop competitor that allows you to rediscover old photo memories, has raised an additional $ 5.5 million in a round led by Redpoint Ventures' Ryan Sarver. 
Others participating included prior investors Founder Collective, Box Group, Lerer Ventures and Thrive Capital. 
Memoir, for background, first launched on iOS in fall 2013, offering users a variety of ways to uncover their old photos, including a time capsule-like function that's a lot like Timehop's. 
But Memoir tacks on several other features, too, including the ability to ask friends for photos you and they both snapped while at the same place at the same time. 
This September, the company rolled out an improved feature it calls predictive photo sharing, which co-founder Lee Hoffman explained involves using data to figure out when you 've arrived and left a location, and which friends were there. 
The app visually prompts you with suggestions of friends you can share with, making the process easier than having to go around asking everyone to text you their photos. 
That being said, what Memoir is doing is a worthwhile challenge for a startup to take on. 
Users are snapping more and more smartphone photos these days, but most get abandoned to the ether after they're taken. 
The photos are only sometimes shared on public social networks, like Facebook, and eventually, users clear out their photo galleries on their smartphones to make room for new photos -- sometimes without even backing up first. 
Hoffman says users today only share 20% of their photos publicly on social networks today, down 10% from three years earlier. 
Meanwhile, the app's users are taking around 5 photos per day, up 75% year-over-year. 
While the company won't talk about specific download numbers or active users, Hoffman would say that one of the factors in the raise was the app's incredible stickiness and its engagement numbers. 
The company is now rolling out a number of new products, including web signup and a full OS X experience, now live here on Memoir's homepage. 
For now, Memoir remains free, but eventually the plan is to introduction a premium subscription option to help the company generate revenue. 
Since the Iron Man arc reactor is a fictitious device, and it has no official scientific explanation in the Iron Man canon that I'm aware of, we might as well something up. 
Now, I'm mixing real science and fake science here. 
So physics nerds and comic-book nerds: Deal with it. 
This type of fusion reactor exists today at research pilot scale. 
The reactor pictured, ITER, is under construction and is planned to be the first fusion reactor large enough to produce a net gain of energy. 
Basically it mashes two isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium, together at such high energies that they combine into one atom. 
When they fuse, the reaction produces helium and a free neutron. 
Critically, helium + neutron has less mass than deuterium + tritium, and the missing mass is converted to energy. 
That energy can be captured as heat to run a traditional steam-driven turbine like any other power plant. 
So what does the arc reactor's torus donut shape tell us? 
It means there are charged particles moving in a circle, contained by a magnetic field. 
High-energy particles usually have high energy because they're moving very fast, and magnetic fields can curve the motion of charged particles. 
Curving the particles' motion into a circle keeps them in one place long enough to get them to collide. 
You may notice that current fusion reactor designs have a lot of magnet coils on the outside of the torus, whereas the Stark Industries arc reactor has a viewing window. 
Plasma containment is the single biggest challenge for hot fusion, but the arc reactor makes it look effortless. 
From this we can conclude that a key technology in the full-scale arc reactor is a way to contain the reaction in a self-sustaining ring. 
This line of reasoning is definitely backed up by the toroidal field lines drawn in the Stark Industries arc reactor blueprints: 
There is also a remarkable lack of cooling loops, turbines, or anything that a traditional thermal reactor would require. 
Which means the arc reactor produces electricity directly, rather than by first generating heat.This observation jives with the fact that the megawatt-scale reactor in Tony's chest does not roast him alive. 
So it can not be a hot-fusion reactor, or a traditional thermal-fission reactor. 
Back to the drawing board! 
Palladium has been proposed as a substrate for cold fusion that does not require hot plasmas and containment toroids, but this concept is pretty widely discredited in the real world. 
Palladium does, however, have some interesting capture and decay properties. 
Wikipedia: Isotopes of palladium 
Palladium isotope Pd-103 produces Rh-103 rhodium via electron capture. 
This means an inner electron is absorbed by the nucleus, merging with a proton to produce a neutron and an energetic photon -- a gamma ray. 
Another isotope, Pd-107, produces Ag-107 silver via beta decay, releasing an electron when a neutron turns into a proton. 
This is kind of the opposite reaction as the above. 
Now, in real-world physics, the electrons balance the resulting atomic nuclei -- silver and rhodium have different numbers of protons from palladium, and the produced/consumed electrons just balance out the proton count so there is no net flow of electricity. 
The palladium core of the device would most likely be Pd-107, which emits high-energy electrons as it decays into silver. 
This is a pretty stable isotope that we would expect to be present in the normal non-separated palladium that Tony might salvage from a conventional weapon. 
Since we know the device uses charged particles travelling within a ring of electromagnets, I surmise that a tiny amount of Pd-103 is ionized by an electric arc thus the reactor's name, and start-up power requirement, which then allows Pd-103 + to be circulated at high velocity within the outer ring of the device. 
The ionization acts to delay the electron capture step until the atom encounters a free electron, and the high kinetic energy due to velocity increases the chances of electron capture occurring once an electron is encountered. 
In effect, the radioactive decay of Pd-103 can be started, stopped, and throttled by the device simply by controlling the ionization and circulation of the Pd-103. 
The device's geometry and electromagnetic fields route the high-energy electrons from the Pd-107 core towards the outer ring. 
There the electrons are captured by high-energy Pd-103 ions. 
This electron capture process emits gamma rays, which are deflected inward to catalyze the beta decay of the Pd-107 core. 
We have some good evidence for this gamma ray emission, because the suit's chestpiece unibeam weapon is clearly an emission of a large number of high-energy photons directly from the arc reactor. 
Normally, the gamma rays are directed inward to catalyze the device's operation, but they can be directed outward in a concentrated energy beam weapon: 
So to summarize: Electrons project outward from the inner core, and gamma rays project inward from the outer ring. 
Because this electron/photon counterflow creates a deficit of electrons relative to protons in the core, a massive electrostatic potential is developed and the palladium core attracts lower-energy electrons from the suit's wiring. 
The ejection of electrons from the core towards the rim of the device produces an electrical cell capable of generating enormous voltage and current. 
Several other lines of evidence also support this type of nuclear decay / electron flux reaction being the mechanism for the arc reactor. 
First, the reactor's glow: 
It could be caused by the ionization arc, but I think Cherenkov radiation is a much better explanation. 
This is a special type of light emission that occurs when an energetic particle such as electron enters a medium like water or air at a speed faster than the speed of light in that medium. 
The high-energy electron flux within the arc reactor would be a natural fit to generate this effect. 
This is a picture of an actual nuclear reactor producing Cherenkov radiation: 
Notice the similarities? 
Unlike electrical arcs, the light from Cherenkov radiation is quiet, cool-blue, and fricken' awesome. 
This is a no-brainer -- the arc reactor's glow is definitely being produced by high-energy electron flux. 
Another aspect of the original model palladium arc reactor was poisoning due to palladium toxicity. 
It's very possible that palladium is simply being ejected from the device into Tony's blood by all the high-energy collisions going on, but this doesn't explain the freaky circuit-looking lines on his chest, and it doesn't explain why doctors can't help him. 
I have a theory that fits the symptoms better. 
Remember, the proposed palladium decay reactions produce rhodium and silver. 
Excess internal silver is known to stain skin blue: 
Rhodium compounds also stain skin, and are highly toxic. 
Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects In fact, because most people have essentially zero exposure to rhodium, the toxicity of rhodium is very poorly-understood. 
This perfectly explains why Tony didn't seek help from the medical establishment for his accumulated heavy metal toxicity -- because he knew the doctors wouldn't know how to deal with rhodium poisoning. 
Tony Stark didn't have simple palladium poisoning, he had palladium decay-product poisoning! 
So you see, everything fits together perfectly. 
The evidence all points towards the arc reactor relying on a Pd-103 / Pd-107 radio-isotopic decay cell to produce electrical current. 
I will start working on my own arc reactor prototype and will post updates when I produce a working replica.

I recently ditched my contract with Verizon and switched to Cricket Wireless, an AT&T - owned carrier that was not only cheaper, but let me bring any phone I wanted -- all with great LTE coverage. 
After a few months, I'm shocked that more people haven't done this. 
You don't get something for nothing in this world, and that's still true with off-contract carriers. 
When you pay less, you get less -- but in a lot of cases, it may not matter. 
Here are some of the possible differences you 'll see with an off-contract carrier: 
See a pattern here? 
All of these are possible differences, but every carrier is different, and a lot of these downsides are avoidable if you do your research. 
Pick the features that are most important to you, and find a carrier that caters to those -- and you 'll never notice the downsides you don't care about. 
Check out our guide to choosing a prepaid plan for some suggestions, as well as your five favorite carriers. 
You can even use a site like Prepaid Finder to compare plans from different carriers, which is a great start. 
Keep in mind that some of the bigger companies offer prepaid plans too, so don't discount them just yet -- T-Mobile's are particularly awesome. 
Of course, while I think these carriers are often overlooked, there are some people who will just be better off with a more expensive, traditional contract. 
Here are some things to consider: 
Off-contract plans may not be for everyone, but I'm continually shocked at how many people overlook them despite being the perfect candidate heck, I'm shocked it took me so long. 
So let's set the record straight: off-contract plans aren't just cheap plans with crappy phones and bad service. 
If you do your research and find the right one, it can be an incredible way to save money -- without making a lot of sacrifices. 
Martial law is necessary and we can not lift it because the government and junta need it as the army's tool, Justice Minister Gen. Paiboon Koomchaya told the news agency. 
We are not saying that martial law will stay in place for 50 years, no this is not it, we just ask that it remain in place for now, indefinitely. 
The justice minister's comments come just ahead of tourist season, which accounts for nearly 10 percent of Thailand's gross domestic product. 
Tourism took a hit following the May 22 putsch that brought Prayuth to power. 
But as NPR reported last month, the head of the Tourism Authority of Thailand said martial law is good for tourism because it ensures the safety of foreign tourists.

Walk into a wine shop and chances are you 'll encounter displays touting the ratings of the wines in front of you. 
Is a bottle rated 88 really not as good as something rated 90? 
It's actually a nuanced issue colored by personal opinions, and you might want to consider what might be the right wine, rather than the best. 
Not only will signs proclaim whether the wine is rated an 88 or a 92, but whole brands are even based around the rating system, guaranteeing the wine inside is rated at least a 90 + even if you have no clue who the winemaker is or what vineyard the grapes came from. 
Make no mistake, the 100-point scale, introduced by Robert Parker in the 1970s as an evolution of the 20-point British system -- which is based on how French students are graded in high school and college -- and now used by outlets and critics such as Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast, Wine & Spirits, James Sucking, Jonathan Newman and many more, sells wine, and it sells it very well. 
And while the people who actually make and sell this wine, as well as many who write about it, increasingly claim they are turning against a system they say is corrupt and bad for wine, in many ways that system is still stronger than ever. 
With so many people seemingly trying to move away from ratings, we decided to investigate what causes the ratings system to continue to have so much power, and what you need to know in order to be a more informed consumer. 
Ratings are as divisive an issue as they 've ever been, and it's clear even in 2014 that they have a stranglehold over the industry. 
That was immediately apparent in the fact that most people we spoke to for this article wanted to be quoted anonymously or off the record. 
While there is disdain for the system, no one wants to truly bite the hand that feeds. 
Even a large majority of other wine sites that tout different ways of discovering wine that they claim are better than the ratings system don't outright say ratings are bad, and many look to find as much of the good in them as they can, because that's just how ingrained they are in our current wine purchasing system. 
The rating scale works because it's relatively simple: wines receive a grade on a 100-point scale -- though no wine has ever been rated below 50. 
The higher the grade, the better the wine. 
Everyone who has gone through grade school knows the value difference between a 92 and a 93 ; hell, you probably tried to explain that difference to your parents one night after a school test when you tried to claim a 94 was just as good as a 96, and your parents just weren't buying it. 
The same is true with wine. 
And that's why, no matter the type of wine, or the outlet giving the rating, the highest score seems to always win. 
One prominent New York area wine shop is well known for often saying that the rating they choose to put on the shelf next to the bottle is always the highest one that bottle received, no matter the outlet. 
The industry relies on ratings because those ratings get one wine into the shop over another, and usually help that wine sell, says Will Schragis, a former Zachy's wine employee. 
It's the idea that the higher point always wins that has caused us to see ratings inflation, much like academic grade inflation, over the last decade. 
There's massive grade inflation with wine, Schragis told me, for many publications, seeing a wine in the upper 90s used to be rare, now it seems to be a regular occurrence. 
The amount of wines that are actually rated is a small pool, and many of these wines receive attention from multiple outlets. 
It's not unimaginable to believe a race to the top is occurring, especially when the outlets themselves also realize that only one of their names is making it next to the bottle with the score, and if their score is the highest, that name will be theirs -- after all, they have to market their product too. 
In a recent Wine Searcher article, the outlet analyzed the most famous ratings giver, Robert Parker, and noticed a disturbing trend: a massive upswing in the amount of wines receiving the perfect score of 100. 
As written on the site: So far this year, 69 wines have been elevated to perfect status, following on from 102 last year and the end of the year tends to see a bumper crop. 
Yet only five years ago, the number of wines awarded 100 points was 38 and even that more than doubled the number from 2004, which was just 17. 
Whether we're seeing more wines that are being created specifically for a critic's taste buds, or score inflation, neither is good for wine. 
One of the easiest knocks on ratings is that they are usually based on one person's opinion. 
That person is usually someone who is said to specialize in a certain region or style, and therefore is better equipped to analyze the wines than someone else. 
What most people don't seem to realize is that ratings usually reflect one person's taste related to a specific region, one Napa winemaker told me recently, and often wineries make wine to appeal to that specific person, especially if that person's rating will help move wine. 
This is a tough business after all. 
Yet it's tough to educate consumers about this fact. 
When you see a rating in a wine shop, it almost never has the critic's name associated with it, but the outlet instead. 
We had a hard time educating customers on when and when not to use ratings, says Schragis, a good rating doesn't mean a wine is better or worse than another, because it's one person's opinion. 
Choosing wine isn't about the best wine, it's about the right wine. 
Understanding that is hard. 
As a winery marketing director told me, ratings are only beneficial for consumers who can see through the sea of critics out there and actually realize how each one is different. 
That takes effort and most people don't have that time. 
But the fact that only a handful of people are responsible for the ratings given out, and that it is hard to distinguish how each is different, is not the main issue most wine industry people have with the system ; the real issue is that these ratings have become so influential that they 've shut small producers out, becoming something many winemakers feel is a pay-to-play system. 
As one winemaker told me when we spoke, look at the ads, and then look at the scores, there is a correlation. 
I have no problem with a magazine selling ads and those ads trying to convince me of what to purchase, but when those ads seem to influence how a wine is rated, that's a problem. 
Interestingly, Parker, who's credited with starting the whole rating movement used to never take ads, instead relying on a subscription model to support his Wine Advocate, but his new magazine, 100 Points, does. 
As another winemaker put it, there are tons of asks of wineries -LSB- asks include things like product donations, free participation in events, requests to open old vintages, appearances, etc. -RSB- by many of the more influential people doling out ratings, and there is sort of an unspoken understanding that if you don't fulfill the requests, the consequence is you may fall off the radar and if you fall off the radar your wines don't get rated and you don't sell as much of your wine. 
Ratings are inherently political, the same winery marketing director told me, we used to get great ratings in the 90s and then our winemaker had a personal falling out with one of the more well-known publications and we haven't made it out of the 80s since. 
Ads that potentially influence a score are bad, but as a wine shop employee who wanted to remain anonymous told me, it can go much further than that: I 've seen publications that even have financial stakes in the wineries they're rating, and that seems even less kosher. 
What everyone understands is that ratings are powerful, they help you sell your wine, said another winemaker who also wished to be unnamed, as people continue to seek out the best, a good rating can take you from a small producer to a much larger one very quickly, selling out all your stock. 
It's not surprising some places play the game, it can be cheaper than building a brand or marketing yourself. 
Yet that game seems more and more to be speaking to an older, established wine audience while the trend of ratings being incredibly important may be changing among the younger generation, at least if their peers, the younger winemakers and wine store owners, have anything to do with it. 
There's some very practical things about a number rating, says Alan Greene, the owner of Brooklyn wine shop Tipsy, but it doesn't tell the whole story. 
More and more, wine shops and winemakers around the country seem to feel this way. 
A traditional focus on ratings by regions such as Bordeaux and Napa could be why these wines have fallen out of favor with younger wine consumers ; a good rating, after all, significantly drives up the price. 
Winemakers are taking matters into their own hands as well, showing how foolish the number system can be. 
Last year, winery owner Robert Hodgson proved how random the scoring was by releasing the results of an experiment he conducted, unbeknownst to the critics, where tasters were told that the wines they were being served were different, but in many cases, they were served the exact same wine three or more times during their tasting experience. 
The results were pretty striking: critics would one time give that wine an 86, another time a 90 and then a 94. 
It was clear from the scoring all being in a range that they liked the wine, but the randomness of the scores proved why a numbers system like the one currently dominating the industry is flawed. 
Especially when people live and die by the digit -- bear in mind in the ratings world 86 means acceptable while 94 is excellent. 
The younger generation isn't turning away from recommendations entirely, they're just rejecting the 100-point system. 
The fact is, there is a ton of wine out there, and it can be tough to know everything. 
Critics and other publications drink a ton of wine, so hearing what they think about a bottle can be useful, in the right context. 
I myself have a few writers I really trust, like Eric Asimov and Jon Bonne, says Schragis but they place wine in context. 
They let you know this $ 20 wine is great against the other $ 20 wines they tasted in the circumstances they said it was good in. 
They don't just slap a rating on it. 
While the numerical ratings system may seem ingrained in the fabric of the wine industry, it's important to remember it's only been around for a little over 40 years. 
Things can change, especially as consumers become more proactive, and outlets begin guiding consumers, helping them explore in order to discover what they like, instead of using a ratings system to tell them what to drink. 
I hope beer and liquor learn from wine's mistakes, says Schragis.

They get to choose whether or not your get to listen to music at all, and if so, they get to choose the volume. 
Do not abuse your radio privileges or you will lose them! 
I don't ever really think you need to take an Uber over the many alternatives, considering the company's atrocious business practices. 
But if you do use the embattled car service app, I submit that being able to control the music you're listening to is a pretty neat feature, especially if you're the type of irritating passenger that's always hectoring drivers about their jams.

Rosetta's journey to intercept a comet took 4 billion miles and 10 years. 
When it left Earth, there was no iPhone, no YouTube, no GoPro. 
The camera now beaming back exclusive comet photos? 
It has 1/1000 of the storage capacity of a modern USB stick. 
The German Aerospace Center DLR, which is charge of Rosetta's science activities, today released a new set of photos taken by the Philae probe as it descended toward the comet. 
But acquiring photos becomes a tad more complicated when you have a very limited amount of memory. 
Remember, taking into account the time to plan and design a 10-year journey, we're talking 90s-era technology here. 
When the camera was developed 20 years ago, memory cards did not exist, the DLR's Stefano Mottola said. 
ROLIS therefore has a limited amount of memory -- just 16 megabytes, which is one thousandth of the amount of data that can be stored on today's USB sticks. 
We did, after all, land on the moon using a computer not much more powerful than a graphing calculator. 
But Rosetta -- and every long-term space mission, really -- has to rely technology that will by obsolete by launch time, much less after years of space travel. 
Engineers still had to design every component, pack it up for a 10 year journey through space, and hope that it worked. 
And for the most part, it did, which is the most impressive part.

For decades, the people who live below the sign have been battling the constant wave of sightseers who flock to see the nine giant letters as part of an Essential Los Angeles Pilgrimage. 
Signs some illegal have been erected on streets, warning that there is No access to the Hollywood Sign. 
But in the last few years, technology has amplified this battle into an all-out war. 
Since they can't physically block the streets to stop cars from arriving, residents have spent years working on the next best solution: Make the sign invisible online -- so no one can find it. 
The sign hangs off the side of Mt. Lee, a peak in the Santa Monica mountain range that runs east to west through Griffith Park, the largest urban park in the U.S.. 
While you're not allowed to scramble right up to the letters and take a seat on the W, you can summit the mountain itself, rewarding yourself with a stunning view of the city, the famous reversed-out letters at your feet it's where I shot the photo below. 
The best access is from nearby Beachwood Canyon, home of the original Hollywoodland neighborhood that the sign was erected to advertise in 1923, at the end of a steep but well-maintained trail. 
When I first moved to LA 13 years ago, I lived at the base of Bronson Canyon, one canyon over. 
From our street we had a fairly clear shot of the sign and on the weekends there were often tourists taking what would later be known as selfies with H-O-L-L-Y-W-O-O-D behind them. 
Whenever I hiked through the neighborhood and up into the park, I'd have at least one carful of visitors stop me to ask for driving directions to the sign. 
For starters, the sign is in a park, so you can't really drive there, I'd say watching their faces deflate. 
Then I'd deliver the second piece of bad news: To actually to the sign, you have to hike, and even then, you end up above it. 
When I'd try to explain that where they were at the moment was probably the easiest place to get the best view, they'd often wave me off, determined they could get much closer by feeling it out themselves. 
So close, yet so far away.

But the sign is both tempting and elusive. 
That's why you 'll find so many tourists taking photos on dead-end streets at the base of the Hollywood Hills. 
For many years, the urban design of the neighborhood actually served as the sign's best protection: Due to the confusingly named, corkscrewing streets, it's actually not that easy to tell someone how to get to the Hollywood Sign. 
That all changed about five years ago, thanks to our suddenly sentient devices. 
Phones and GPS were now able to aid the tourists immensely in their quests to access the sign, sending them confidently through the neighborhoods, all the way up to the access gate, where they'd park and wander along the narrow residential streets. 
This, the neighbors complained, created gridlock, but even worse, it represented a fire hazard in the dry hills -- fire trucks would not be able to squeeze by the parked cars in case of an emergency. 
The neighbors pleaded with the city to help. 
Then the local councilmember, Tom LaBonge, who is known for leading regular hikes through the park and up to the sign itself, proposed something that seemed crazy, if not impossible: He would look into changing the sign's official GPS coordinates, effectively hiding it from tourists forever. 
A few years athe anti-tourist rhetoric reached a fever pitch, with homeowners mounting a vicious campaign threatening visitors, who, unsurprisingly, just kept coming. 
Some neighbors painted their curbs red illegally to discourage parking and tacked up more signs illegally warning against trespassing. 
In a vacant lot, someone took the time to build a full-on piece of land art that seemed to echo the large white letters in the distance: TOURISTS GO AWAY. 
In response to the vitriol, and because I myself had witnessed the crowds firsthand, I wrote what I thought was a very helpful bit of service journalism on my blog, The best way to see the Hollywood sign. 
In my piece, I argue that driving through the twisty-turny streets of Beachwood Canyon is actually the best way to snuggle up to the sign. 
I very clearly direct would-be visitors to the address of a small public park with an excellent view of the famous icon, from which you can hike up to the sign. 
Why? 
Because if you try to find out how to actually get to the Hollywood Sign by asking Google Maps, you won't get anywhere near it. 
Even though Google Maps clearly marks the actual location of the sign, something funny happens when you request driving directions from any place in the city. 
The directions lead you to Griffith Observatory, a beautiful 1920s building located one mountain east from the sign, then -- in something I 've never seen before, anywhere on Google Maps -- a dashed gray line arcs from Griffith Observatory, over Mt. Lee, to the sign's site. 
Walking directions show the same thing. 
When I tried to get walking directions to the sign from the small park I suggest parking at in my article, Google Maps does an even crazier thing. 
It tells you to walk an hour and a half out of the way, all the way to Griffith Observatory, and look at the sign from there. 
No matter how you try to get directions -- Google Maps, Apple Maps, Bing -- they all tell you the same thing. 
Go to Griffith Observatory. 
Gaze in the direction of the dashed gray line. 
Do not proceed to the sign. 
Don't get me wrong, the view of the sign from Griffith Observatory is quite nice. 
And that sure does make it easier to explain to tourists. 
But how could the private interests of a handful of Angelenos have persuaded mapping services to make it the primary route? 
She admits that there was once a goal to hide the sign online completely, but it was deemed impossible. 
At one point we were successful in getting Google to take the address down, but it appears so many other places like the city council offices and the city of LA that they put it back up. 
In the end, it was Councilmember LaBonge who found a different solution. 
Working closely with Google and the GPS company Garmin, he was able to convince them to change the to the sign. 
Carly Hysell from Garmin confirmed to me that the change was made in the spring 2012 map release. 
The point of interest right at the sign was removed and ` sign view' points of interest on the ground were added, but they aren't at the sign itself. 
Now there are actually places that drivers might be directed: Griffith Observatory, and puzzlingly, the viewing platform at the Hollywood & Highland Center, which is about four miles away on busy Hollywood Boulevard.

Now imagine for a second that you 've flown all the way here from Istanbul to see the Hollywood Sign. 
And you end up at a mall. 
Although the Hollywood Sign Trust has posted these viewing places on their website, Isroelit says the nonprofit's official position is to remain vague. 
So the website insists there is no address, devotes an entire page to explaining why you shouldn't hike to the sign. 
We're very explicit about not parking in the neighborhood, she says. 
But we don't own the land and we don't control the city streets. 
This email was accompanied by photos of a small fire and a burst fire hydrant, both of which my writing had caused. 
Also, the email mentions that a dog was run over by a car in the area, which was apparently also my fault. 
It gets worse than simply firing off a few emails. 
Earlier this year, these Beachwood Canyon residents successfully petitioned the city to close a public trail to the sign to keep tourists at bay, erecting a giant fence and hiring security guards. 
The trail has been closed since late March. 
Now no one, even residents, can use one of the most popular trails to access one of the country's largest urban parks, in the middle of our public space-deprived city. 
When I spoke to Councilmember LaBonge he emphasized that his job was to protect potential environmental and safety concerns. 
There are impacts to the canyon that we are trying to resolve, he said. 
But on the other hand, he said, nothing has actually been restricted in the area as far as parking or roadblocks. 
It's very important to have access at all time to that mountain. 
The trail that's been closed -- ostensibly for repairs -- is being reopened soon, he told me. 
The solution going forward likely won't involve more mapping tweaks. 
LaBonge's next project will be a shuttle that would take people from a location in Hollywood to a place where they could easily access the park and the trail to the sign -- without bringing their cars. 
But he also agreed that the online battle had been tough for the city to win. 
The internet is like a wild river, he said. 
It allows anything and everything and you hate to see anybody drown. 
When that wild river is tamed, it's usually in our best interest. 
Mapping companies might blur satellite imagery in the name of public safety, like certain international borders and government buildings. 
But the fact that cartographers are publishing false information about public lands in the middle of Los Angeles is quite worrying. 
Over at Garmin, Hysell noted that their cartographers do, in fact, take input outside of their own experiences driving the routes. 
They do receive data on a regular basis from city officials, county officials, DOT websites, and so on, and of course, make updates and adjustments to the mapping accordingly, she says. 
They also take reports from users, too, and apply changes as deemed worthy and verifiable. 
So what's happening in Hollywood is a disturbing peek into the future of digital cartography. 
A few dozen homeowners in one of the city's wealthiest zip codes -- who bought their homes knowing I assume about the letters hanging just outside their bedroom windows -- have found a way to keep people out of their neighborhood by manipulating technology. 
It doesn't seem like it could happen just anywhere ; Hysell agrees that the Hollywood Sign was a special exception. 
But where do the exceptions end? 
A group of homeowners petitions Zillow to hide specific property information and prevent certain populations from buying homes? 
A group of well-to-do Yelpers deliberately scramble the addresses of their favorite restaurants, so undesirables can't discover them? 
Because our mapping services are now subject to the whims of angry, powerful residents, we have to rely on other sources to give us accurate directions. 
In a way, the post on my blog is almost like passing out hand-drawn paper cartography from person to person, a map to buried treasure that hangs in plain sight. 
Until the online maps are updated properly, I'm here to help anyone -- tourist or resident -- who wants to experience all LA has to offer. 
Just let me know if you need directions. 
What does it say that my favorite games this year have all been radar blips I discovered weeks before their arrival? 
Games like Shovel Knight, Valiant Hearts, Entwined, Hohokum, Velocity 2X, and This War of Mine? 
Or should that be counterculture? 
The Alaskan Iñupiat, a hunter-gatherer people whose way of life the game thoughtfully channels, exemplify a society that may sound otherworldly to United Statesians. 
This, though the Iñupiat live in our 49th state and enjoy full U.S. citizenship. 
Iñupiat principles include coexistence between humans and wildlife, respect for nature, one another, and one's elders basically forging social systems that don't harm the world, sharing food, songs, dance, and stories on a communal level, and cultivating a spiritual connection with the land. 
In short, community-informed selflessness. 
Somehow Never Alone, by Alaska-based newcomer Upper One Games, manages to pull that off with a kind of narrative dignity and gameplay introspection all too rare in this medium. 
And rather than functioning as esoteric window dressing, the story's precepts actually inform the game design. 
Take cooperation, a principle Never Alone foregrounds from the start. 
You play as Nuna, a young Iñupiat girl caught in a never-ending blizzard, fleeing a cruel interloper and trying to save her village by discovering the source of the storm. 
She encounters a magical animal early on, a mysterious arctic fox who can conjure ethereal beings. 
The fox, here portrayed per northern Native American stories as the noble messenger not our archetypal trickster, is both Nuna's symbolic and functional gameplay connection to the spirit world. 
You alternate between controlling Nuna and the fox by tapping a button, or if you want to play co-op, pulling in a second player. 
Where Nuna moves slowly and can only jump limited distances, the fox is lithe and limber. 
Nuna can shift and climb on heavy objects, and wields a bola that can shatter stanchions of ice blocking your way forward, while the fox can scale or leap between sheer barriers. 
The fox can also reify spiritual entities by lingering near them, each of these serving as platforms Nuna winds up traversing on or dangling from. 
Never Alone uses these contrasts to craft artful platforming-puzzle stumpers that often involve multidirectional motion through maze-like settings inspired by Iñupiat myths. 
And that mythology really gets into your headspace, evolving from predictable Alaskan snowscapes, knockabout blizzards, and seas of boreal ice to more surreal moments. 
In some you 'll consult with owl-faced men ; in others, strange phantasmic creatures glide past you in elliptical arcs, casting eldritch light on glistening surfaces as they threaten to seize and carry you skyward. 
If Campbell was right when he argued part of mythology's function is to encourage introspection by casting us out of the here and now, let Never Alone stand as an exemplar of the principle for future game designers. 
Over the course of the game I learned about Sila the Iñupiat name for the environment, from the earth to the moon, that in Alaska they call igloos apuyyaq, and that time in extreme climates is less circadian than it is ecological. 
At one point I listened to the harrowing story of a child who almost died when swept out to sea on a piece of broken-away ice. 
These moments both ground the design principles and reinforce the game's value as a cultural teaching tool. 
Ironically, Never Alone occasionally falters when you play it by yourself. 
Whichever character you're not controlling will sometimes mistime a leap and end up dying through no fault of yours. 
But it's a rare occurrence, and the designers wisely reset you to just before each puzzle. 
So you move quickly through a relatively short game that's only mildly difficult anyway. 
Think of Never Alone as the opposite of a platformer like Shovel Knight, whose silly story what's it about again? 
you slid past to revel in the sublime controls. 
Here, the story and surroundings predominate, while most of the challenges are slower and contemplative. 
Never Alone is less a game you race than ruminate through. 
I believe players are hungry for this kind of thing, the game's writer Ishmael Hope told Gamasutra earlier this year. 
I hope he's right, because we need more experiences like this, ones that can serve both as cultural ambassadors and invite us to contemplate persuasive worldviews other than our own. 
Like the best big-fish stories, tales of your latest shootaround can be ripe with embellishment. 
There was that time you hit 14 three-pointers in a row, but no one was around to bear witness. 
The time you hit 95 out of 100 free throws, matching Jeff Hornacek's NBA-best percentage in the 1999-2000 season and coming within a rim-out of beating Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf's 1993-94 mark. 
That time you totally dunked a volleyball. 
The new ShotTracker system can help verify or debunk those claims with its sensors. 
It's a three-piece system that consists of a net-mountable sensor, a diminutive wrist sensor, and a mobile app that connects to the sensors via Bluetooth to track your makes and misses. 
The complete kit, which goes for $ 150 and ships in early December, includes a wristband with a slot for the 1-by-2-inch sensor. 
Also included is a compression sleeve if you'd rather wear the wrist sensor that way. 
There's no built-in memory on either sensor module, so you 'll need to keep your iOS or Android device near the court for your stats to be registered. 
The mobile device receives input from the wrist and net sensors via Bluetooth, caches that data if there are any connection problems, and pushes your stats to the cloud for crunching and sharing with friends and/or coaches. 
In addition to tracking your improvement in terms of buckets and bricks, the app also has a menu of workout options and lets you compete against other ShotTracker users and view their stats. 
The app features customization options for coaches, allowing them to create and share their own workout plans and simulate results using different player lineups. 
While the next-generation version of the ShotTracker will register your position on the court -- a prototype has been built that uses TDOA to pinpoint shots automatically -- this first model will map your location based on the workouts provided by the app. 
According to ShotTracker co-founder and COO Davyeon Ross, the newer auto-tracking version will be available in mid-2015 and will be able to map your location on the court to within 4 inches. 
Ross says you 'll need to recharge the lilliputian, water-resistant wrist sensor after eight hours of usage, but the net sensor gets up to three months of battery life per charge. 
The net-mounted unit is weatherproofed, and it's designed to be used on both indoor and outdoor courts. 
But can you fool the system by chucking the ball directly through the net and hitting the hoop sensor? 
Ross says it's possible, but the wrist sensor's six-axis motion tracker is programmed to make sure the shooting motion matches up. 
The system also has algorithms to ignore pump fakes, dribbles, and other non-shooting actions. 
So if you really want to fake it out, you 'll need to mimic a shooting motion while a co-conspirator shoots layups. 
Or you could hire Ray Allen to wear your wrist sensor in order to boost your beyond-the-arc stats.

The artists involved in Bright Matter, a newly opened exhibition at Muriel Guépin Gallery in NYC, aren't known for their subtleties. 
They're good at things like projection mapping onto massive architectural masterpieces, warping senses with lasers, light and sound, building large-scale installations out of tape and nets. 
So to see them subdued in a gallery setting is a little unexpected. 
In Bright Matter, they still get to do what they do best -- bend our perceptions with visual illusions -- just on a smaller, less technologically in-your-face scale. 
Curated by artist Joanie Lemercier and produced by Juliette Bibasse, the exhibition is an exploration of how we can use light, space and materials to change the way we view the world around us. 
This idea isn't new. 
For as long as art has existed, its creators have loved screwing with the way we see things. 
The cavemen at Lascaux may have used flickering firelight to make their drawings appear to move ; the Op-Art movement of the 1960s showed just how powerful simple shapes and lines could be in producing visual trickery. 
Today, artists have increasingly embraced a digital toolkit to achieve similar effects. 
In recent years, it's becoming more and more accessible and easy to manipulate light, says Lemercier, adding that technologies like projection mapping, LEDs, high resolution immersive displays have played a major role. 
By manipulating light, you can then by extension manipulate reality. 
But the work in Bright Matter shows that just because you can use code and software doesn't mean you should. 
Details can get lost in the technical flashiness -- the nuances of ideas and concepts are drowned by the sheer wow-factor of it all. 
I tend to have reached a brick wall when it comes to be ` inspired' or creative' in front of a computer screen, says Lemercier. 
The mouse and keyboard are such rigid and basic input devices, I don't feel like hitting square bits of plastic is helping me in my creative process. 
Take for example the work of Nonotak, the Parisian duo of Noemi Schipfer and Takami Nakamoto best known for their geometric projection-mapped installations. 
In Bright Matter they 've translated their same optical idea into simple, analog pieces made from vinyl tape arranged on a transparent piece of plexiglass. 
As you walk by the pieces, they produce a subtle moiré effect using the wall behind them. 
Similarly, François Wunschel of 1024 Architecture has moved from large-scale architectural installations to creating a triptych of black and white wireframe cubes. 
The lenticular prints have a depth that creates motion as you change your vantage point. 
Numen For/Use, the design studio responsible for massive tape and netted installations are showing Trapezium, a grid of fluorescent tubes that are housed in spy glass to create what feels like a miniature version of an infinity room. 
And Lemercier himself has scaled back from his epic projection-mapped installations, instead backlighting laser-cut paper to bring his algorithmically-created landscapes to life. 
For a generation of ADD culture consumers, this departure can be challenging -- Where are the flashing lights !? 
Where's the booming music ?! 
But like so many things in life, expending a little bit of effort often produces the most interesting results. 
As Lemercier succinctly sums it up: Working without any of the obvious tricks makes me work harder. 
With a lift-up top, your coffee table can serve as an impromptu desk or dining table. 
This DIY version is made out of pallets and features a pedal-controlled wheel system so you can smoothly move the table. 
Instructables user dialmformostyn posted the nine steps to building this creative coffee table. 
Besides three or four pallets and bed slats, you 'll need gas struts for the lift-up mechanism and decent woodworking skills. 
You could also buy the lift-up hardware separately and continue the rest of the steps for building the table.

We 've talked about preparing for Black Friday, when to start paying attention now, and reassured you that you're not going to miss out by shopping from home. 
Now let's talk about the deals themselves. 
A few months after rebooting Kotaku Deals back in 2013, it was time to cover the Steam Summer Sale. 
The hype was palpable, but did the deals live up to it? 
Not so much. 
If you want to hold out on buying all your PC games for a few select times a year, and then blindly click the purchase button, you could certainly do worse than the Steam Sale, but prices were far from unprecedented, and competitors like Amazon and GreenManGaming were undercutting left and right. 
I was very relieved when Black Friday and Cyber Monday did not repeat the same overhype and under delivery scenario. 
Last year's holiday shopping window was filled with never before seen price lows and great deals, all available online. 
Perhaps most importantly, many of those price lows and promotions have not repeated themselves since, almost 365 days later. 
This practice is in no way relegated to Black Friday, and yes, of course it happens. 
You have retailers who are successful because they aggressively offer the lowest prices, and retailers who are successful because their shoppers don't know any better. 
We 'll vet the deals for you, and if you're not sure, just ask. 
If you're standing in a department store thinking about buying a blender with no reviews, no price history, and no coverage in front of you, put it down and back away slowly. 
We also tend to tell our readers to just ignore whatever regular price a retailer is throwing up. 
It's not in any retailer's best interest to adjust those promptly. 
Retail does of course have seasonal price trends, but the expectation on the part of many publications that readers will somehow internalize these averages is ridiculous. 
Lifehacker does a fantastic job of packaging the data, but so much reliance on patterns obscures the fact that great deals are happening in every category all the time. 
Additionally, our product-savvy readers are far more likely to be shopping for the TV, not a TV. 
You don't need to wait until the day after Thanksgiving for great deals or really the day before, but that's a subject for another post. 
The great deals are already here, and we 'll be covering them every day on Kinja Deals, on our Twitter and Facebook, and on your favorite Gawker Media sites. 
We work together with you to find the best products and the best deals on them, click here to learn more. 
We operate independently of Editorial and Advertising, and if you take advantage of an item we cover, we may get a small share of the sale. 
We want your feedback. 
Russia launched the Kosmos 2499 rocket mission back in May as part of what seemed like just another mission to further develop its constellations of ` Rodnik' communications satellites. 
Usually three satellites are released during these missions, but this one had a fourth object. 
The U.S. thought that this strange radar return was just debris, but not so much anymore. 
According to the BBC, Russia told the UN that the piece of debris in question was actually a fourth satellite, which in itself is nothing too odd, as the US launches classified payloads all the time. 
Additionally, Russia has been all about surprises lately, so it was seen as just another question thrown on top of a pile of questions. 
But then satellite observers saw the craft changing its orbit in ways that are far from normal for even spy satellites that usually do anything they can to conserve their finite fuel. 
Unofficially termed ` inspector satellites,' these are basically maneuverable space vehicles that can approach other satellites for both passive and potentially active purposes. 
On the passive side of things, these space drones of sorts can observe the design of a satellite, taking photos and laser measurements of it, and in some cases, they can even listen to the targeted satellites transmissions. 
On the active side of things, this capability could be used to refuel or even repair other satellites in orbit. 
Then there are the darker sides of the ` active' mission, with the potential of possibly blinding, jamming or even kinetically destroying enemy satellites during a time of hostilities. 
The idea of one satellite manipulating, or even ` shooting down' another is nothing new, with the Soviets designing cannons into their Salyut 3 and Almaz orbital platforms during the Cold War. 
Additionally, multiple anti-satellite satellite systems were also proposed during the Reagan era ` Star Wars' initative. 
Yet today, almost 25 years since the end of the Cold War, we are finally and quietly facing the stark possibilities of this whole new dimension of warfare. 
In which, extra-atmospheric drones can potentially take an enemy's most sensitive eyes and ears, as well as their most advanced form of communications, away, seemingly without warning. 
Beyond the question mark that is the X-37B program, DARPA has had some eyebrow raising initiatives recently that could clearly be ` soft' covers for programs aimed at orbital dominance. 
The Phoenix program in particular is of great interest. 
Under this program a ` tender vehicle' with arm like appendages that can dynamically maneuver in orbit would capture derelict space junk, such as old satellites with communications dishes. 
It would then attach a small ` satlet' to that abandoned piece of hardware that would provide power and the brains for the re-purposed said space junk. 
In effect, this would save money as you could launch a tender vehicle with dozens of satlets for the cost of a single new-build communications or listening satellite or two. 
This all sounds nice, but clearly Phoenix has as many offensive implications as it does economical ones. 
That same tender vehicle loaded with satlets could also potentially have its way with enemy spy and communications satellites, attaching themselves in an attempt to tap into the enemy's orbital hardware or to lay waiting for the right time to strike. 
If successful, such a ` parasitic' systems could take enemy satellites offline at just the right time, or even de-orbiting them at will. 
This would solve the bane of ` kinetic' anti-satellite weaponry, such as missiles, as pulverizing something in low earth orbit just makes thousands of pieces of ` space junk' that can threaten friendly and unfriendly orbital systems alike. 
This satlet deploying mission seems almost perfectly suited for the X-37B, with its pickup truck sized payload bay and reusability. 
Even disabling, capturing and returning to earth a small enemy satellite from orbit is really not out of the question, especially if future derivatives of the X-37B are built, ones that are larger in size with more payload capacity. 
The fact of the matter is that just as we have seen rapid developments in unmanned aircraft and submersible technology here on earth, low earth orbit is beginning to see similar technological effects. 
Just like cyber warfare, the ability to survey, intercept, jam, incapacitate or even commandeer enemy satellites represents another combat ` dimension' of the future. 
As the technology proliferates, it will come down to measures and countermeasures as far as whose orbital sensors will be most vulnerable from orbital attack and whose will not. 
Currently, the U.S. is in a very good place technologically where it can dominate this looming future battlefield. 
When it comes to recent Russian and Chinese efforts, coming within observation range of another orbiting object, and even maneuvering around it, is not the same as manipulating it. 
Additionally, America has substantial tracking capabilities for objects in orbit and Infrared and radar systems currently used for missile approach warning systems today could potentially be miniaturized and deployed on key military satellites for defense and warning purposes. 
Additionally, our space-based manipulation abilities are second to none, and the X-37B, or a derivative of it, may be the perfect vehicle to facilitate such a technology in the future. 
Yet all these technological and strategic advantages erode quickly without continued investment. 
When it comes to the DoD, there are a lot of rabidly competing budgetary priorities out there right now. 
Yet imagining the U.S. military operating during combat at even close to its potential without the virtual armada of satellites it currently depends on is not a pretty thought. 
Which makes such an ` asymmetric' capability an absolute dream for our enemies and potential enemies alike. 
The 2014 Formula One season wraps up this weekend in Abu Dhabi. 
For some like Mercedes, which cinched the constructor's championship a while back and is a lock for the driver's championship, it will be time to celebrate. 
For others like Caterham, which is so far in the hole it relied upon crowdfunding to complete the season, it will be a time to ponder the future. 
But for scores of team logisticians and DHL employees, it will be a time to relax, because they will no longer be in a mad dash to pack and ship 22 cars and a few hundred tons of equipment to the next race. 
Formula 1 is many things: an elaborate show, an engineering extravaganza and a logistical nightmare. 
There are 19 races held over eight months on six continents. 
The turnaround from one race to the next can be as short as one week. 
Each of the 11 teams will travel about 62,000 miles during the season, bringing with it two cars and roughly 50 tons of stuff. 
You name it and they're probably hauling it, from spare parts to the pots and pans used in the catering trailers. 
It's enough to fill six Boeing 747 jumbo jets, and it keeps an army of people on the road for as many as 200 days a year. 
The work starts about three hours after the checkered flag falls. 
Once the cars have been through the post-race inspection to ensure teams haven't done anything illegal to gain a competitive edge, team mechanics strip it to the last component. 
The engine and gearbox are removed, along with the front and rear wings, mirrors and suspension parts. 
Each is placed within its own foam-slotted box. 
But sometimes custom-fitted foam and an anvil-tough case isn't enough, says McLaren's Alan Field, the team's trackside support manager. 
In that case, McLaren turns to another tool: humble but steadfast bubble wrap. 
It's especially good for protecting painted surfaces, which is a prime concern because no one wants to see that glorious silvery-chrome paint or a sponsor's logo scuffed. 
The chassis is protected by its own custom-made cover, and placed within its own case. 
You wouldn't recognize it if you saw it packed up, Field says. 
All of this happens come hell or high water literally. 
The show must go on, as the saying goes, and F1 is no exception. 
This can be a headache if the next race is the following weekend F1 typically schedules races at least two weeks apart, there are four back-to-back grands prix weekends on the 2014 calendar. 
In those cases, everything has to be at the next track within 36 hours so teams have enough time to reassemble the cars and get everything sorted before practice begins Friday. 
This can require moving everything from, say, Malaysia to Bahrain in a matter of days. 
Depending on which way everyone and everything is headed, time zones can relax or tighten the schedule by several hours. 
Invariably, something comes up. 
Sometimes it's a small inconvenience, but sometimes it's a colossal nightmare like Typhoon Phanfone, which clobbered Japan during the Japanese Grand Prix. 
Everyone was working under miserable conditions -- strong winds, torrential rain and poor visibility -- but with the inaugural Russian Grand Prix just one week away in Sochi, they had to buckle down and suck it up. 
You can't just stop what you're doing because of the weather, Field says. 
You 've just got to crack on. 
Nonetheless, delays happen, and sometimes teams are left with less time than usual to get everything ready for the next race. 
That means longer hours, and sometimes bringing in extra help from the factory back home. 
The cars may get the most care, but there are several dozen tons of equipment to be packed and shipped. 
Each team carries enough spare parts to rebuild their cars, 40 sets of tires, 2,500 liters of fuel, 200 liters of motor oil and 90 liters of coolant. 
And then there are the tools. 
And the computers. 
And enough food to make as many as 200 meals, plus all the stuff needed to prepare those meals. 
And ... and ... the list goes on. 
All told, the biggest teams may be hauling as much as 50 tons of gear, and even the smallest outfits are schlepping 30 tons of stuff. 
It takes between three and six hours for the teams to pack it all up. 
Then it's all handed over to DHL, which has to get everything to the next city. 
That's no less complicated. 
A fleet of seven jumbo jets does the bulk of the work, flying stuff, in some cases, halfway around the world. 
A fleet of trucks hauls it all from the airport to the track, which can be a matter of minutes in the case of Malaysia or a few hours in the case of Brazil. 
When the action is in Europe, where there are shorter distances between tracks, DHL will truck stuff instead. 
Although there is a routine to it all, there are quirks to each race or track. 
All the breakdowns on each operation have some particularities, says Pier Luigi Ferrari, DHL's motorsport deputy managing director. 
They key to making it all go smoothly is planning, planning, and more planning. 
Preparations begin a year ahead of time, and extra attention is paid to new venues like the Sochi Autodrom that hosted the inaugural Russian Grand Prix this year. 
Ferrari says his team of roughly 80 people needs the long lead time to nail down every last detail, from what the roads are like to how to negotiate the customs bureaucracy. 
There can be a monumental amount of red tape. 
Some countries are more closed, more difficult, he says. 
Any food taken into China, Malaysia, or Singapore, for example, must first be fumigated and certified to ensure to ensure invasive species or other creatures aren't hitching a ride. 
It's a hassle, yes, but not insurmountable given enough advance notice. 
Our timing, our schedules do not allow us not to be prepared, Ferrari says. 
Not everything goes by air. 
Teams typically have five or six sets of common parts -- things like work benches, tool trolleys and the like, along with stuff like PR and marketing material -- and send them by sea. 
It's slower, but given enough sets, the teams can send them weeks in advance so they arrive in plenty of time. 
But the nature of Formula One makes perfect planning impossible. 
As race day approaches, teams inevitably make changes to their cars, or find themselves in need of a spare part left at their home base. 
Something always comes up at the last minute, and we have to be prepared as usual, Ferrari says. 
The moment an order comes in, DHL dispatches someone to fulfill it and get it on the next plane out. 
Even last-minute requests can be delivered to the track within 24 to 36 hours. 
But in F1, where everything is measured in thousandths of a second, Ferrari's crew is always looking for ways to save time. 
Usually it's given to us today, Ferrari says. 
And they expect it yesterday. 
Websites that have worked themselves into our routines and vocabularies have begun to figure out what kind of people we are. 
By developing algorithms that track our online habits, tech companies have created online experiences that are deeply personal and self-determined. 
At its advent, the Internet was seen as the Great Equalizer -- globally, all users ostensibly had access to the same content. 
The amount of content available, however, is vast, and websites like Facebook, Netflix, and Google are overwhelmed by it. 
Tech companies have found that tracking user habits enables the creation an online universe where you only mostly see what you'd like to see, essentially determining the Internet that users are exposed to. 
Mark Zuckerberg famously told his team at Facebook that a squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa. 
Relevance is the focus of Facebook's personalization algorithm, and their team has created a world of front yards filled with dying squirrels, keeping you far away from the dying people in Africa. 
If it seems like Facebook is reading your mind, it isn't -- but their team does have a thorough understanding of how your mind works. 
The smallest aspects of your online life, from how long you linger on a photo of your ex to whose events you RSVP attending to, are compiled to create a complete picture of your ideal Facebook experience. 
This has created what The New York Times calls an online echo chamber, wherein we are all trapped in our online comfort zones. 
Google is in on the game too. 
An avid gamer searching for grand theft auto will get vastly different results from a police officer, and a person standing in the middle of Manhattan will not see the same articles as his friend in California when he searches for best sushi recommendations. 
When searching for information, whether for research, for pleasure, or for necessity, Google displays results according to their relevancy algorithm -- so what you end up reading is, usually, what you want to be reading. 
The changes we are experiencing are large-scale innovations to the way that we, as users, engage with web content. 
Netflix just announced a $ 150 million investment in recommendation systems, including the creation of a 300-person recommendation team but they say it's worth it. 
Netflix Chief Product Officer Neil Hunt recently told the audience at the Conference on Recommender Systems that the average user only browses the Netflix app for one or two minutes before making a decision, leaving the app a very limited window for engagement. 
The key for reaching a user in that time period is making sure the first thing they see is what they came to the site for or at the very least, interesting enough to keep them there. 
Netflix, at last count, had 76,897 genres listed, which is about as micro as genre-tagging can go. 
Hunt's affection for the long tail is translated as hyper-obsessive categorization, which not only contributes to effective customer targeting, but also spot-on product development. 
When conceiving their own content, Netflix has customer data so specific that it is effectively a blueprint to television success. 
And what our technology knows about us, it knows about our friends. 
Foursquare recently announced a massive overhaul to their app's structure: The app was split into two, Foursquare and Swarm, as part of a complete reenvisioning of geotagging. 
Foursquare is now the home of local recommendations, which are influenced by Swarm check-ins ; Swarm is where users plan meetups, check in to locations, and leave personal notes. 
When one takes into account the possibilities that are created by the influx of location-based platforms, the personalization of Internet enters entirely uncharted territory: The real world. 
New apps like Qork are looking to build on the foundations of these local social apps, like Swarm and Foursquare, to make personalization of local content deeper, so that two different users could experience an entirely different cities within the same app. 
As we become more dependent on technology, the ability for our online experiences to influence our real world experiences becomes less of theory and more a reality. 
We are developing an Internet that is no longer worldwide, but is completely personalized. 
Matthew Panzarino, writing for TechCrunch, sums it up best: 
What happens when a social network knows exactly what posts you 'll want to read and tells you when you can see them, and not before? 
What about a shopping app that ignores everything that you're unlikely to buy and taps you on the shoulder for only the most killer of deals? 
What about a location aware app that knows where you and all of your friends are at all times but is smart enough to know when you want people to know and when you don't? 
Foursquare can take us to a new city and show us a good time. 
Netflix can find the most indie of movies that are statistically proven winners in their genre + age group + theme + period category. 
Anywhere that a user can express an interest, they are paid back in personalized, optimized content -- and only that. 
The problem is not with the information we're receiving, but what's being left out. 
The echo chamber phenomenon is real. 
We, as users, are creating self-fulfilling prophecies every time we check into our apps ; we make our preferences known and then have them fed back to us, affirming our choices 
By narrowing our field of experience to what we wantto be experiencing, we are only being exposed to information that is relevant -- thereby making what we're seeing the only information that we feel is relevant. 
Customized content is the new way of exposing users to the whole Internet through their own experiences, habits, and interests, using information that users are often not conscious of. 
Uber now lets you play backseat DJ for your car's sound system via Spotify in 10 cities, and on my demo ride-along, I was impressed by how easy and seamless it works. 
Music selections made on your phone quickly start playing through the driver's app connected to the stereo, and there's no data cost to the passenger or driver beyond the premium Spotify subscription. 
The integration demonstrates both how Uber could allow more in-car personalization and control, as well as how Spotify could strengthen the value of its paid subscriptions through an ecosystem of third-party apps. 
Obviously, the partnership comes at a tough time for Spotify, as no one would want to tie their brand to Uber right now given the scandal around one of its execs suggesting the company dig up dirt on journalists who criticize it. 
But beyond that, the deal makes sense as the two companies are trying to change how you spend money by touting convenience. 
Spotify tells me the Uber integration will roll out globally in the next few months, but is now live in 10 cities: London, Sydney Singapore, Stockholm, Mexico City, Toronto, NYC, LA, SF, and Nashville. 
Uber is aggressively trying to get all its drivers equipped to run Spotify, and teach them how the system works. 
Until then, perhaps the worst part of the integration is that not all drivers have it, and you won't know if your driver does until they confirm you ride. 
To use Spotify in Uber, you go into your Uber app's profile page and Connect Spotify to your $ 10 a month premium subscription. 
Once you request a ride and are assigned a driver, if they have Spotify set up, you 'll see a Music bar at the bottom of the Uber screen. 
Tapping that gives you quick access to your own Spotify playlists or a set of city-specific playlists that feature great driving jams. 
Once you select a song, it will go into a holding pattern until your driver presses the Uber button to start the ride. 
Their phone will immediately start playing the song through the car's system. 
This works nicely so the second you get in the car, you have control of the soundtrack. 
While riding, you can choose different songs at any time, and they only take about one second to start playing in the car, which feels very snappy. 
If you want to pick song outside of your playlists or Uber's, you can tap Spotify shortcut button in the Music bar on Uber to pop over to your Spotify app. 
There you can search or choose any other song. 
Since the music doesn't actually stream from your phone, you won't be hit with data charges for playing music in Uber's, and the companies are covering the data charges for drivers too. 
Overall, Spotify + Uber feels like a natural, graceful collaboration. 
It's not sluggish, confusing, or limiting in terms of music choice -- all ways they could have screwed it up. 
One of the big complaints ride-sharing services sometimes get is that drivers are too chatty when passengers want a quiet ride. 
It sure won't be silent, but at least now you can ride in peace with a cabin full of of your favorite jams instead of small talk. 
The tired, grimy feeling you get during long trips makes for a tiring experience. 
It sounds almost silly, but you can use a quick spritz to refresh physically and mentally. 
The combination of altitude and recycled air in a plane can leave your skin dry, use wipes, face oils, or a spray to rehydrate. 
All of these can easily fit into your dopp kit, toiletries bag, or carry-on side pocket as well as clear airport security. 
Which one you use is really personal preference and what your skin responds well to. 
On your next trip, give this a try and see how much it changes your mood and increases your comfort level.

At the dawn of the world wide web, early adopters were scooping up domain names like crazy. 
Which led to quite a few battles over everything from MTV.com to McDonalds.com. 
In May of 1994, Wired reported that just a third of Fortune 500 companies had registered the obvious versions of their names. 
The next few years were chaotic to say the least. 
And boy were there some truly strange pairings. 
Like when the makers of Candyland went after a porn company. 
And that time some meat lover went trolling and really pissed off PETA. 
Below, we have a brief history of the world wide web's early domain name wars. 
Sometimes things were settled with money, other times with lawsuits. 
But the rightful owner read: the big guys always won. 
Former MTV VJ Adam Curry snapped up the mtv.com domain name back in 1993. 
Curry supposedly told MTV what he was doing and they initially didn't have any problem with it. 
In fact, according to Curry, MTV said that they had no interest in the internet. 
All that changed in 1994 when Curry quit MTV. 
The network suddenly realized that it was a space that they should probably control. 
The TV network sued Curry but he vowed to fight, claiming that his battle was the Roe v. Wade of the Internet. 
Curry ultimately gave up control of the name, settling out of court for an undisclosed amount. 
I'm no reproductive rights lawyer, but I'm pretty sure that's not how Roe v. Wade was settled. 
In 1994, a reporter named Joshua Quittner bought mcdonalds.com for a story he was writing for Wired about the value of domain names. 
But nobody at McDonald's seemed to have any interest in being online. 
Are you finding that the Internet is a big thing? 
a media relations rep reportedly asked Quittner. 
We may laugh about it now, but for most Americans it really wasn't quite a big thing yet. 
As late as 1995 people were still writing articles about how the internet was just a bunch of hype. 
At the end of his article Quittner encourages people to email ronald@mcdonalds.com with ideas for what to do with the domain. 
Should he auction it off? 
Or keep it as a trophy, he wondered? 
Interestingly, sell it to McDonald's for a profit wasn't floated as an idea in the piece. 
Porn company Internet Entertainment Group, Ltd. purchased Candyland.com back in 1995. 
As you can imagine, Hasbro, the makers of the Candyland board game weren't terribly pleased to learn this. 
They sued to get control of the domain. 
The court found in favor of Hasbro, pointing out that they had held the trademark on Candy Land since 1951. 
They also raised the minor detail that a reasonable person might expect to find something much more innocent at a domain associated with a children's game. 
The probable harm to Hasbro from defendants' conduct outweighs any inconvenience that defendants will experience if they are required to stop using the CANDYLAND name, the ruling said. 
The porn company was allowed to keep the name for 90 days after the ruling to let people know that they were moving to another domain. 
Michael Doughney nabbed peta.org back in 1995 because he loved animals. 
Specifically, eating and wearing them. 
His website was called People Eating Tasty Animals and needless to say the other PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, weren't too pleased. 
The animal rights organization sued Doughney and the case wasn't settled until 2001. 
Doughney argued that his site was parody and thus afforded First Amendment protection, but the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed. 
The court said that Doughney was obliged to give up the domain due to the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act ACPA of 1999. 
Road Runner Computer Systems scooped up roadrunner.com and had a legitimate trademark claim for the name Road Runner in Tunisia. 
Time Warner wasn't too happy about that. 
You see, they had the U.S. trademark for the Road Runner cartoon character. 
Time Warner approached domain register Network Solutions Inc NSI in July of 1995 and demanded that the domain name be placed on hold. 
Time Warner was initially successful, but both parties went to court. 
The computer company eventually settled with Time Warner and handed over the domain, though the details of their agreement were never disclosed. 
Strangely enough, roadrunner.com is currently owned by Mark Monitor, a Thomson Reuters company that focuses on brand protection. 
The company develops, advanced technologies that enable customers to manage and scope their online brand risk, keeping one step ahead of brandjackers. 
When people talk about the next big thing, they're never thinking big enough. 
It's not a lack of imagination ; it's a lack of observation. 
I 've maintained that the future is always within sight, and you don't need to imagine what's already there. 
What's the buzz? 
The Internet of Things revolves around increased machine-to-machine communication ; it's built on cloud computing and networks of data-gathering sensors ; it's mobile, virtual, and instantaneous connection ; and they say it's going to make everything in our lives from streetlights to seaports smart. 
But here's what I mean when I say people don't think big enough. 
So much of the chatter has been focused on machine-to-machine communication M2M: devices talking to like devices. 
But a machine is an instrument, it's a tool, it's something that's physically doing something. 
When we talk about making machines smart, we're not referring strictly to M2M. 
We're talking about sensors. 
A sensor is not a machine. 
It doesn't do anything in the same sense that a machine does. 
It measures, it evaluates ; in short, it gathers data. 
The Internet of Things really comes together with the connection of sensors and machines. 
That is to say, the real value that the Internet of Things creates is at the intersection of gathering data and leveraging it. 
All the information gathered by all the sensors in the world isn't worth very much if there isn't an infrastructure in place to analyze it in real time. 
Cloud-based applications are the key to using leveraged data. 
The Internet of Things doesn't function without cloud-based applications to interpret and transmit the data coming from all these sensors. 
The cloud is what enables the apps to go to work for you anytime, anywhere. 
Let's look at one example. 
In 2007, a bridge collapsed in Minnesota, killing many people, because of steel plates that were inadequate to handle the bridge's load. 
When we rebuild bridges, we can use smart cement: cement equipped with sensors to monitor stresses, cracks, and warpages. 
This is cement that alerts us to fix problems before they cause a catastrophe. 
And these technologies aren't limited to the bridge's structure. 
If there's ice on the bridge, the same sensors in the concrete will detect it and communicate the information via the wireless internet to your car. 
Once your car knows there's a hazard ahead, it will instruct the driver to slow down, and if the driver doesn't, then the car will slow down for him. 
This is just one of the ways that sensor-to-machine and machine-to-machine communication can take place. 
Sensors on the bridge connect to machines in the car: we turn information into action. 
You might start to see the implications here. 
What can you achieve when a smart car and a smart city grid start talking to each other? 
We're going to have traffic flow optimization, because instead of just having stoplights on fixed timers, we 'll have smart stoplights that can respond to changes in traffic flow. 
Traffic and street conditions will be communicated to drivers, rerouting them around areas that are congested, snowed-in, or tied up in construction. 
So now we have sensors monitoring and tracking all sorts of data ; we have cloud-based apps translating that data into useful intelligence and transmitting it to machines on the ground, enabling mobile, real-time responses. 
And thus bridges become smart bridges, and cars smart cars. 
And soon, we have smart cities, and .... 
Okay. 
What are the advantages here? 
What are the savings? 
What industries can this be applied to? 
Here's what I mean when I say people never think big enough. 
This isn't just about money savings. 
It's not about bridges, and it's not about cities. 
This is a huge and fundamental shift. 
When we start making things intelligent, it's going to be a major engine for creating new products and new services. 
Of all the technology trends that are taking place right now, perhaps the biggest one is the Internet of Things ; it's the one that's going to give us the most disruption as well as the most opportunity over the next five years. 
In my next post in this two-part series, we 'll explore just how big this is going to be.

Here's a simple test that lets you toggle between an extremely high-quality file music file and a low-quality music file. 
Can you tell the difference? 
We 've been hearing for years that MP3 ruins music with its lossy compression. 
But can you really tell the difference? 
New streaming music subscription service Tidal is amongst the first to offer lossless audio, and in an effort to get more people to sign up, it's set up this simple A/B test. 
Fire it up, and the test will play you a song and allow you to toggle between two versions of five possible songs. 
This is a blind A/B test, meaning you won't know which is high quality and which isn't, which is one of the surest ways to eliminate your biases in choosing one or another version. 
I got 4/5 right on my good mid-range headphones, but it's harder than you would think! 
And if I hadn't be scrunching my face and listening super carefully, who knows if I would have noticed. 
If you score very low, maybe you're not the type of person who needs to be investing in lossless files? 
Which great, that's a lot cheaper for you.

3D printer company Makerbot experienced almost exponential growth. 
After a few years in a cramped Brooklyn warehouse, the team grew from 20 to 600 in a few short years and the company was bought by Stratasys, a major player in the professional printing space. 
Makerbot's new CEO, Jenny Lawton, sat down with us to talk a bit about what it meant to be a global company and how it felt pushing Makerbot's engine from 0 to 100 in what seemed like seconds. 
It's cool to be the CEO of the coolest company in Brooklyn, said Lawton after some coaching. 
Lawton and her team are currently working on interesting character partnerships with brands like Sesame Street and Hello Kitty. 
The company is also working on newer versions of their software and hardware which Lawton was a bit reticent to describe. 
We're super-excited about growing the ecosystem, she said. 
They have a number of interesting announcements coming at CES, she said. 
The worst thing about Makerbot's growth? 
The fact that she can't be sure who works at the company anymore in the elevator, she said.

The FCC anticipates that large cable companies will sue the agency after it votes into place net neutrality regulations. 
This would be a mere repeat of history. 
It will have the clarifying impact of forcing hands: Companies that tried to split the fence will be decidedly on one end of it or the other. 
Here's Chairman Tom Wheeler from earlier today, as quoted by The Hill: The big dogs are going to sue regardless of what comes out. 
-LSB- ... -RSB- We need to make sure that we have sustainable rules, and that starts with making sure that we have addressed the multiplicity of issues that come along and are likely to be raised. 
Read simply, Wheeler is pointing out that anything his agency puts into place that can't withstand a well-funded lawsuit is moot. 
This makes the current tussle concerning what legal foundation to base new net neutrality regulations on a bit more important than it might appear at first glance. 
Wheeler continued: I want to move on open Internet rules with dispatch. 
The FCC now expects to move on net neutrality in 2015. 
A vote in December had been widely expected. 
The President recently entered the fray with a call for strong net neutrality rules, and use of Title II, which would most certainly draw legal ire. 
We know that because it's already been promised. 
Two quotes, for flavor, from two ISPs -LSB- Bolding: TechCrunch -RSB-: 
Reclassification under Title II, which for the first time would apply 1930s-era utility regulation to the Internet, would be a radical reversal of course that would in and of itself threaten great harm to an open Internet, competition and innovation. 
That course will likely also face strong legal challenges and would likely not stand up in court 
Moreover, if the government were going to make such a momentous decision as regulating the entire Internet like a public utility, that decision is more properly made by the Congress and not by unelected regulators without any public record to support the change in regulation. 
If the FCC puts such rules in place, we would expect to participate in a legal challenge to such action. 
So Wheeler isn't blowing smoke. 
This is going to happen. 
Ever since, Taylor Swift decided to give Spotify the boot, under the auspices of helping songwriters, there has been a conversation suggesting that there was somehow a golden age for songwriters when they controlled their own destiny -- and the Internet killed all that. 
I'm here to tell you that there was never any such time and if anything, the Internet was the best thing that ever happened to musicians. 
Here's a simple truth: The Internet is the best distribution channel ever created and it's up to musicians and record companies to figure out how to exploit it. 
And here's a hint: It's not the old way of selling records. 
Let's look back at the reality of the music business for a minute, shall we? 
The business is littered with stories of exploitation. 
In the 1950s, black blues musicians and early rockers often never saw a penny for their work, even when they were covered by white rock musicians a decade later. 
You got ta get an album out, You owe it to the people. 
We're so happy we can hardly count. 
Bruce Springsteen didn't record an album for over two years in the 1970s while he fought to get out from under an exploitive contract he signed before he understood the music business. 
The Beatles lost control of their publishing catalog when Michael Jackson bought it in the 1980s. 
Billy Joel's accountant who was his brother-in-law allegedly ripped him off to the tune of millions of dollars. 
Sting's accountant did something similar. 
Now that we 've burst that myth, let's look at what the music industry was like in the late 1990s. 
The record companies had been living the high life for years mostly on the backs of musicians and the gravy train was coming to a fast halt as the digitization of music made distributing it on the Internet easy-peasy. 
Then a couple of college kids created Napster and figured out a way to share music without paying for it. 
There would be no turning back. 
The response was predictable as record companies circled the wagons and tried to sue their way out of the problem, but what they failed to realize is they had lost control of the distribution. 
It was all hunky-dory for them when musicians came begging at the door because they controlled the means of production, the recording facilities and they controlled distribution through the record stores and radio stations. 
It was a great deal for the record companies, they raked in millions and gave a small percentage back to the musicians so much for golden ages. 
The Internet took that control away from the record companies and where did it put it? 
It put it in the hands of the musicians themselves. 
They no longer had to beg at the door because they had their own distribution channel and they could get their music out through social media and YouTube and other huge mostly free platforms without the record company help. 
Sure, there are still record companies and musicians as popular as Taylor Swift who can afford to play the system and thumb their noses at the likes of Spotify, but when Spotify's owners suggested they had helped stem piracy and gave people a legal way to listen to music, they weren't wrong. 
The same goes for iTunes before that. 
Both of these systems provided a legal way to distribute music and make money. 
In the same interview at Web Summit Bono continued to flog the record companies saying Spotify was not the enemy here. 
When people pick on Spotify: Spotify are giving up 70% of all their revenues to rights owners. 
It's just that people don't know where the money is because the record labels haven't been transparent, he said. 
One other point Bono made is that there is a trade-off when it comes to artists. 
Of course you want to be paid, but you also want to be heard or read, and the idea that nobody would ever hear your songs is, in his words, terrifying. 
These channels let you be heard and he gets that but of course like Swift, his band is wildly popular and he can afford to look at this intellectually. 
I'm not suggesting these new channels didn't come with their own set of problems, but they provided a way for musicians to distribute their music and get paid something, rather than having no hope of getting paid when people went the way of Napster and other illegal download sites. 
But, it's also important to remember that the Internet also changed the notion of the song itself. 
It wasn't any longer about getting paid for every play. 
It was about getting the word out about your music and using those channels like YouTube to whet the appetites of your fans. 
Not everyone is going to be as big as Taylor Swift and in fact very few people are, so they have to use the system and get their constituencies excited about their music, so they show up at concerts and buy merchandize and give them different ways of making money. 
The Internet changed everything, but not the way that Swift would have you believe. 
In fact, she manipulated it to perfection. 
When she removed her music from Spotify, she or her handlers knew that it would spark a conversation and get people talking about the new album and were they ever right. 
We are still talking about it several weeks later. 
And if you look at the core of that strategy, it's taking advantage of social media and the Internet while trashing that same channel as exploitative. 
Oh the beauty of irony and the Internet. 
It worked perfectly. 
Swift is one smart cookie who understands the power of the Internet and used it to drive more sales of her album and sell more tickets to her concerts. 
And unlike Miley Cyrus she didn't even have to twerk on national TV to get us talking. 
She just went after a streaming music service. 
Both strategies were brilliant, worked to a T and took advantage of the Internet to get us talking. 
If you 've ever had the sneaking suspicion that hand dryers in public bathrooms just spray bacteria into the air, then you 'll want to look at this spatterful photo. 
A trio of scientists set out to test exactly how hand dryers aerosolize bacteria, and the results are gross. 
The study from August, brought to our recent attention by Jesse Singal at Science of Us, began with paint. 
Volunteers coated their hands in paint and dried them with paper towels, a warm-air dryer, or a jet dryer to visualize how droplets are dispersed. 
That Jackson Pollack you see up above is the work of a warm-air dryer. 
The researchers then coated volunteers' hands in lactobacilli bacteria to simulate the dirty hands of someone who did not wash properly. 
Air samples revealed that jet dryers, which put out forceful blasts of air, were the worst offenders. 
Gentler warm-air dryers fared slightly better, and paper towels, of course, did not do spew out much bacteria at all. 
To a number on it, using jet dryers led to 27 times as much bacteria in the air than using paper towers. 
Now, presumably, none of this would matter if our hands were already clean when we went to dry them. 
Reminder: you're probably washing your hands wrong.

The countdown to Thanksgiving has begun. 
And for those of us who already feel short on time during a regular week, the pressure is on to figure out just how to squeeze in all that extra shopping, prep work and cooking ahead of the holiday. 
In the informal survey of Salt readers we conducted a few weeks ago, many of you told us that one of the most challenging aspects of planning for and cooking holiday meals is timing -- especially when you 've got busy schedules and only one oven. 
But a lot of common holiday foods need not to be prepared last-minute. 
I think that a majority of your menu can be done days ahead of time, says Candy Argondizza, vice president of culinary and pastry arts at the International Culinary Center. 
So come Thanksgiving Thursday, you need only reheat your side dishes and focus on cooking that turkey. 
If you scoff at the idea of reheating, keep in mind it's a shortcut that the best restaurants use. 
I think what a lot of people don't get ... is how rare the occasion is, even in the best restaurants, that something is pulled out of the oven and brought immediately to the table, says James Briscione, director of culinary development at the Institute of Culinary Education. 
There's great romance to that notion and image, but it just doesn't happen. 
With that in mind, here are The Salt's recommendations for timing the rest of your week. 
* And if you're already behind, we recommend our guide to shopping for your holiday meal online. 
Defrost the turkey. 
A 20-pounder can take as long as five days to thaw out in the fridge. 
And you want to defrost it in the fridge, not at room temperature, notes Argondizza. 
The turkey should be fully defrosted the day before you roast it. 
Go grocery shopping. 
Buy the hardier vegetables like squash, potatoes, sweet potatoes, onions, kale and garlic at the grocery store. 
These will keep well in the refrigerator until you cut them up on Wednesday. 
See Tuesday for when to buy other vegetables. 
Also buy nonperishable ingredients like crackers, jelly and any canned vegetables you plan to use. 
Make and freeze your soups and/or gravy. 
If you want your gravy to have some of the flavors of your roasted turkey, you can refortify it with some of the flavors later on Thursday, say Argondizza. 
If you're making your own pie, make the pie crusts, wrap them tightly in plastic and put them in the freezer. 
If you have the freezer space, you can go ahead and assemble your pies, then wrap them tightly in plastic and freeze them. 
Feel good about your plan to have everything mise en place. 
Make a Thanksgiving playlist with Spotify or try out a few curated by experts on Songza. 
Make the dips and cranberry sauce and refrigerate them until Thursday. 
Cranberry sauce, because of its high acidity, can stay fresh when refrigerated for up to two weeks. 
Buy the more delicate vegetables, like green Brussels sprouts, and refrigerate them. 
You can blanch and shock your vegetables by putting them in boiling water for a few minutes to cook, then plunging them into an ice bath. 
Once they're cool, you can keep them in the fridge until you need them. 
Try not to use salt -- it 'll break down the vegetables and make them mushy. 
Assemble the stuffing and put it in the freezer until it's ready to be baked on Thursday. 
Freezing will actually strengthen the flavors of the celery, onion and herb, Mary Kimbrough, a partner at Culinary Nutrition Associates, told The Dallas Morning News. 
You can thaw the stuffing in the refrigerator. 
And don't worry about the raw eggs in the stuffing, says Argondizza. 
If it's refrigerated, it's in the safe zone, she says. 
Assemble and bake your pies. 
Unless they're custard-based like pumpkin pie, you can keep them at room temperature until you serve them. 
If you froze your pies, let them thaw in the fridge overnight Wednesday. 
You 'll bake them the next day. 
Our experts are split when it comes to mashed potatoes. 
Argondizza says it's fine to prepare your taters a day ahead -- just put them in a dish covered with tin foil to refrigerate overnight. 
But Briscione notes that mashed potatoes don't always reheat well, so he leaves this step for Thursday. 
Clean the salad greens and store them in a plastic bag in the refrigerator. 
You can toss and dress the salad just before serving the next day. 
Chop the vegetables like onions, peppers, broccoli, zucchini and squash. 
They 'll still look fine on Thursday, just cover them with a damp paper towel before storing them in the refrigerator sealed in a plastic bag or container with lid. 
If you plan on roasting your veggies, toss them with oil and herbs skip the salt before refrigerating them -- the oil will help keep them from oxidizing. 
Even more finicky vegetables like sweet potatoes, potatoes or fennel can be cut and stored in the fridge in a bowl of water. 
No need to cover the bowl. 
If you brine your turkey, do it in the afternoon and leave it soaking overnight in the fridge until you start roasting Thursday morning. 
Your brine should include a cup of salt per gallon of water. 
Note: If you buy a kosher bird, it has essentially already been brined, so you can skip this step. 
Preheat the oven and make sure to leave 2 to 4 hours to roast the turkey. 
Let it rest for at least 30 minutes. 
While the bird is resting, move on to baking your stuffing and roasting your vegetables. 
Note: You don't need to serve roasted vegetables fresh out of the oven ; they taste just as good at room temperature. 
The same goes for potatoes gratin. 
Briscione also offers this last piece of advice: Focus on doing a few things great. 
You don't need a million dishes, just a few that wow. 
Walking is a simple thing that becomes really, really important as we age. 
Being able to get around on our feet for extended periods of time not only makes everyday life easier, it's linked to fewer hospitalizations and greater longevity. 
As we get older, though, the body takes about 15 to 20 percent more energy to cover the same terrain. 
Here's something that can prevent that slide: running. 
Older people who regularly ran for exercise had walking economy similar to much younger people, according to a study by Ortega and colleagues at Humboldt State and the University of Colorado, Boulder. 
Older people who walked for exercise, however, while they were undoubtedly reaping the other benefits of walking, had walking economy similar to older, sedentary adults. 
In other words, the walking didn't beget more efficient walking, while running did. 
The study, published Thursday in PLOS ONE, took 15 men and 15 women with an average age of 69 who were already consistent runners or walkers. 
Participants walked on special treadmills at three different speeds and had their oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production measured during their sessions. 
The runners consumed 7 to 10 percent less energy than the walkers. 
Importantly, there weren't any apparent biomechanical differences between the groups, such as differences in stride time or stride frequency that might account for the results. 
So the brakes aren't rubbing. 
The next question is, What is it about the engine using the fuel? 
he says. 
One hypothesis is that the runners were more efficient at the cellular process that turns oxygen into ATP, the chemical form of energy that fuels the muscle fibers to move. 
There's evidence to show that process is impaired with natural aging, says Justus. 
And research suggests that aerobic exercise can counteract that process. 
It's not 100 percent clear that's what's going on here. 
Another possible factor is muscle co-activation: older adults tend to use more muscles to perform the same movement than do younger people, perhaps to stabilize the joints. 
It's quite possible that runners, who are used to spending more time on one foot, use fewer muscles to perform a given movement than the walkers. 
That might contribute to their lower use of energy, says Justus. 
So the next step, he says is to analyze their data to see how muscle co-activation might be a factor. 
Other future experiments might look at other activities that are also more aerobically intense than regular walking, such as cycling or even very fast walking, to see if they might offer some protection. 
It's really important to mention that this research can't prove that running actually caused the better walking economy. 
Study subjects were already doing their preferred form of exercise before they entered the study, and it's possible that the runners had greater walking efficiency for some other reason. 
And by no means should this turn anyone off walking, says Ortega. 
The health and social benefits you reap from walking are enormous, he says. 
But older folks who run may be getting a leg up on at least one element of walking performance. 
Just because your collared shirt came with a couple of spare buttons hanging off a tag doesn't mean you always have time to sew a replacement back on when the need arises. 
So an emergency replacement button that temporarily clips onto your shirt like a paperclip so you can quickly do it back up needs to exist -- and, like, yesterday. 
And while Yeon Hee Jung and Kyung Soo Kim's creation doesn't actually exist yet, hopefully the designers will be able to come up with a universal version that works with any button so they don't have to convince clothing manufacturers to adopt the new design, and could just sell it themselves. 
Because there's an entire world of dress shirt-wearing drones that would buy these up by the thousands.

Right now, in a place you 've never visited, a person you 'll never know is dying. 
If he's dying in a particularly devastating way -- and, more importantly, if he is leaving behind shareable content -- it is possible that millions of strangers will mourn his or her death tomorrow. 
Why? 
Last week, there is a good chance that Facebook served up to you a Buzzfeed post entitled A Father Sings To His Dying Newborn Son After His Wife Dies Following Childbirth. 
Below the site's iconic yellow buttons -- LOL, win, omg, cute -- sits, indeed, a video of a father singing to his dying newborn son after his wife died following childbirth. 
As the incubator hums and clicks, you can, if you want, watch a man in anguish sing for the end of his small family. 
In a tab next to Gmail, you can watch his helpless son die. 
The video has spread across the world, BuzzFeed boasts. 
According to Buzzfeed and YouTube's public statistics, the post has been viewed over three million times ; the video, over 14 million. 
As you could imagine, Facebook played a large part in the story's proliferation. 
BuzzFeed's post remained pinned to the top of the blog's Facebook page until Tuesday and, from there, was shared over 46 thousand times. 
For days after the video was posted and picked up on other sites, the story sat at the top of Facebook's Trending column, which appears on the right hand side of your Facebook page: 
Facebook users shared Buzzfeed's post with captions like: Speechless and sobbing ; Omg so sad! 
; No matter what happens in your life, stuff like this brings it into perspective ... Poor Guy ... Heartbreaking. 
It bred a large community of people grieving in public over a single stranger's intense, seemingly private loss. 
This most recent post is just one example in an Internet full of oddly hectoring tributes to fallen strangers. 
Gawker, true as always to our name, isn't exempt from cashing in on this desire. 
A quick look at our tragedy tag offers abundant examples of grief-for-grief's sake.

Grief porn is as old a tabloid category as sex scandal. 
Like regular pornography, it offers a packaged, heightened jolt that mimics a natural, human experience. 
It's voyeuristic, addictive, and compulsively attractive. 
It grabs at a desire to indulge when indulgence is otherwise unavailable. 
It promises a brief, satisfying release. 
And, like regular pornography, the internet has transformed it. 
Freed from the already relaxed constraints of tabloid journalism, grief porn is no longer obligated to fake newsworthiness or importance. 
You don't need to die in a particularly tragic way ; your death doesn't need to be the occasion for punishment or law-enactment. 
You just need to have produced consumable, shareable content before your untimely death. 
Rather than a news angle allowing a writer to smuggle grief porn into a paper, a grief-porn angle allows a content creator to smuggle a shareable unit onto Facebook. 
There is an essential and almost appealing honesty to this another way it resembles regular old sex porn: Look at This Video and Feel Sad and Then Tell Your Friends! 
And because in grief porn, unlike in porn porn, we imagine our indulgence in as noble rather than indecent, we feel comfortable -- if not obligated -- to share it with our friends. 
This is by design, of course. 
On a crowded social internet that places a premium on generating outsized emotion and intense reaction, these stories are as close as a content producer can get to a guaranteed hit. 
Each social grief-porn story is surrounded by the jarring visual and verbal vocabulary of the social web: TRENDING, POPULAR, SHARE, LIKE, small upward-pointing arrows, tiny blue thumbs-up signs. 
We 've already been trained, anyway, to present our best selves -- the person we want others to believe that we are -- on social media. 
The reaction to tragedy is not longer just a privately murmured better them than me but also a public performance: I am a feeling human! 
It's hard to criticize people for honestly feeling an emotion, or publicly expressing those honest feelings. 
Even grief porn's most active consumers would agree that the grief one feels for a newborn whose life has only been introduced to you in the context of its impending death is different from the grief felt in confronting the loss of people who made up a part of your life. 
Where Facebook and the content providers that orbit it have succeed is in gamifying and monetizing that honest reaction, frictionlessly converting the near-giddy emotional rush received from a awful story into a compulsion: You have to read how sad this is. 
We dress it up with sad emojis and condolences, we talk about crying, and sometimes do cry, but it's entertainment -- an episode of Parenthood, but with real people. 
It's something to see, extract a rush of feeling from, and forget. 
I mean, let's say it: We get off on it. 
Maybe there is something noble to it. 
Sharing A Father Sings To His Dying Newborn Son After His Wife Dies Following Childbirth on social media could do good: A fund to pay for the Blackbird family's expenses has raised nearly $ 200,000. 
Similarly, the young musician who Just Died had a song reach number one on iTunes before his death. 
Blackbird, too, made a grim appearance at the top of iTunes' rock chart, so bully for UMG chairman Lucian Grainge, or whoever it is that owns Beatles recordings now. 
Millions of people have watched the young girl's cover of the Downton Abby theme song, which is, I suppose, nice for her, and pretty good for Downton Abbey. 
Because we live in such an odd time, we can even watch the Blackbird singer address his newfound Internet fame at the memorial for his wife and son. 
Even in his grief, and in confronting the strangeness of being at the center of a viral tragedy, he is warm and charming: 
I 've had an outpouring of love and support, most of them involve the words' I know words aren't enough, but.' 
And now I know how that feels, because when I say ` thank you' to all of you, that's not enough. 
I could never articulate how much your support and your strength and your prayers and your emails and your Facebook messages and your text messages -- I don't know how any of you got my number, but there's been a lot of me just, ` Uh, okay, thank you, um.' 
I didn't bother going into the whole,' I don't know who you are, but thank you.' 
I just -- it has meant so much to me, and so when I say ` thank you' I know exactly what you mean. 
Doesn't that make it worth it? 
you might wonder. 
Isn't it worth the possibly misguided intent and the showiness of our Facebook crocodile shares if it relieves even the slightest amount of sadness for those at the center of these tragedies? 
As with most questions about the effects of social media the only real answer is ¯ \ _ ツ _ / ¯. 
I certainly don't think that we always know it does. 
I can't imagine many in a state of overwhelming pain would feel as gracious about Internet strangers texting to express their sympathies for lost loved ones they have never met. 
There isn't much of a chance the victim is going to see our sympathies anyway. 
Unless we somehow procure his or her cellphone number, which apparently some do, we're expressing grief and pain for the benefit of our friends and families, not for the victims of a tragedy. 
Or, really, we're expressing it for ourselves -- to show the world our sensitivity and our humanity. 
We immerse ourselves in pain and then treat normal human responses to these enforced emotional tests as badges of honor. 
We 've convinced ourselves that these adventures into the darkest moments of others lives' are a way to honor them, and to honor humanity in general. 
We put our compassion on display in a Facebook post. 
We turn grief into a shibboleth for humanity. 
We stare at someone else's death and then tell others to do the same. 
It's porn we can share, because demonstrates our compassion. 
If only porn porn were so lucky.

DataFox, the online research platform that allows anyone to track information about private tech companies, has now brought its service to mobile in the form of a new iOS application. 
The free app provides DataFox subscribers with access to over 500,000 company one-pager's, private and public lists, and an events stream detailing recent news on companies tracked, like new hires, turnover, acquisitions, IPOs, new product releases, and more. 
As you may recall, DataFox first launched its intelligence platform as a service at TechCrunch Disrupt 2014, promising to put the capabilities of professional analysts into the hands of anyone interested in the same sort of information, research and insights. 
Except, unlike analysts who manually dig for information then enter it into spreadsheets and databases for further analysis, DataFox collects information automatically and in real-time using data-mining and machine learning technologies. 
It pulls in data from the web, RSS feeds, YouTube and other API partners like CrunchBase, AngelList, LinkedIn, Alexa and more. 
Instead, co-founder Bastiaan Janmaat describes the app as something akin to a Refresh for companies. 
If you're not familiar with Refresh, it's that handy app that pings you with information and insights about the people you're meeting with just ahead of your meeting time, allowing you to quickly catch up on what's been going on with them and their business, while also potentially offering you common ground to connect over -- like having mutual friends, for instance. 
You can also track your own lists of companies in the app, or those public lists you follow. 
To date, users, including DataFox team members, have created 16,000 lists, but users' lists are private by default. 
There are, however, some 760 public lists that can help you get started, including selections like The Billion-Dollar Club, Sharing Economy, E-commerce, Internet of Things, FinTech, and more. 
One thing I 've been happily surprised to see is that every large company in America has a team who are focused on the Valley, and the high-growth tech companies coming out the Valley, says Janmaat. 
The innovation is occurring at such a high speed, it's really hard for these people who don't have an office on Sand Hill Road or in SoMa to keep tabs on the companies that are up-and-coming, to prospect for interesting businesses, or to do research on them. 
Janmaat declined to say how many total customers DataFox has signed up since its launch, but he did say that it now has over 30 paying corporate customers ranging from single seat to 50-seat deals. 
He's not allowed to disclose the name of those customers, either, but characterizes them as large corporations, including large tech companies, banks and investment firms. 
The company also offers individual accounts for $ 50/month or professional accounts for $ 400/month. 
Those customers find the company on their own and sign up, while the corporate clients interact with DataFox's sales team who also sell additional services and customizations. 
The new DataFox app is a free download account required here. 
While Android is on the roadmap, it has not been in high demand. 
Android customers can use a mobile website instead.

The executive actions that President Obama announced Thursday are wide-reaching and complicated. 
Even the top-line numbers -- such as how many people will be affected -- are tough to pin down, because they are based on estimates of a population that Obama himself has said is living the shadows. 
NPR's Scott Horsely has outlined many of the details. 
We 've been sifting through memos and fact sheets to drill a bit deeper. 
Here's what we 've come up with: 
The vast majority are likely to be parents with children who are U.S. citizens or hold a green card, according to the White House. 
They will be shielded temporarily from deportation. 
Another big group falls under the expansion of a 2012 executive action called DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which defers deportation for people brought into the country illegally as children. 
These are projections, and small tweaks can yield different numbers. 
Pew, for example, only counts parents who are living with their children, while the White House may use a different method. 
And to add another wrinkle, the Migration Policy Institute says media coverage of the executive actions could spur many young people -- who were already eligible -- to apply for deferred action and a work permit under DACA. 
Remember, it is estimated that about 60 percent of those young immigrants actually applied for deferred action. 
If they have lived in the U.S. for at least five years, the parents of children who are either U.S. citizens or hold a green card are entitled to deferred action and a three-year work permit. 
The parents can also apply for a Social Security card, but are not entitled to Social Security benefits. 
The executive actions also expanded protection to include any children who were brought to this country illegally before Jan. 1, 2010. 
With DACA, the president deferred the deportation of those who were born after 1981 and entered the country before June 15, 2007. 
There is a third category of people who will be affected. 
Broadly, the executive actions will make it easier for professionals or talented entrepreneurs to remain in the country. 
We have not seen a reliable estimate for how many people are included in this category. 
No. 
The executive actions do not provide a path to a green card or U.S. citizenship. 
As President Obama said in his address, only Congress can do that. 
The administration is clarifying the way it deals with what it calls advance paroles. 
Essentially, the Department of Homeland Security is saying that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services -- at its discretion, and case by case -- can grant those immigrants permission to travel out of the country and then come back in. 
There are slightly more than 11 million undocumented immigrants estimated to be living in this country. 
While the remaining 6 million won't receive a work permit, the government says it will not actively try to deport them if they have not been convicted of a crime. 
In its place is something dubbed Priority Enforcement Program. 
Local and federal authorities will still share information, but Immigration and Customs Enforcement will only ask local authorities to hold immigrants who have been convicted of a serious crime. 
You 've heard the self-help gurus who say positive thoughts can bring us happiness, wealth, and success. 
But there's another side to the story. 
Here's why positive thinking often backfires -- and why many of us are starting to resent it. 
Positive thinking is that spin we put on life and all its hardships. 
Instead of getting mired down in doom-and-gloom thinking, many of us work to adopt a more positive outlook and work under the assumption that the best is going to happen. 
This kind of thinking typically starts with self-talk -- the inner narrative of unspoken thoughts that run through our heads. 
Over the course a day, these semi-automatic thoughts vary in terms of their positive and negative intensity depending on any number of factors. 
Some of this self-talk arises from logic and reason, while others are instigated by misconceptions, stress, biases, the influence of others, and even hormonal triggers. 
Proponents of positive thinking say it's important for us to be aware of our negative thoughts so that we can replace it with a more positive frame. 
Studies do indeed show that there are many positive social and health benefits to be had by adopting such thinking, but there's a danger in taking this idea too far, or in overstating its potential to meaningfully change our lives. 
As we're learning, many of the claims made by positive thinking gurus are exaggerated. 
Some attempts to apply positive thinking can even backfire. 
And worse, they can even be construed as a form of victim blaming at the expense of recognizing larger structural problems. 
Research done last decade shows our attitudes can have a profound effect on our longevity. 
Yale University social psychologist Becca Levy found that people with a sunny, optimistic outlook on growing older live longer than those who are constantly worrying. 
Those who feel bad about growing old, on the other hand, experience an accelerated aging process. 
Levy's work, which spanned attitudes over a 30 year span, suggests that negative attitudes serve as health risks akin to smoking and excessive alcohol use. 
She has conducted other studies showing that positive thinking can also translate to better memory and even sharper hearing. 
Along the same lines, a 2011 study by Robert Gramling showed that patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease who had a positive outlook about their recovery were less likely to die over the next 15 years. 
They also had better physical functioning a year later. 
Positive thinking can also be used to combat depression. 
A therapeutic strategy called Positive Activity Interventions PAIs has shown some promise. 
The treatment involves intentional positive behaviors and thoughts, such as performing acts of kindness, expressing gratitude, meditating on positive feelings towards others, and expressing one's best possible self. 
Randomized controlled experiments have shown that PAIs lead to increases in positive emotions and well-being. 
Such outcomes show that it's not necessary to make dramatic life changes when combating depression. 
Instead, by employing these simple cognitive and behavioral strategies, people can reliably increase their own happiness. 
Positive thinking can also prevent us from getting sick. 
A 2003 study in Psychosomatic Medicine showed that people with a positive emotional style PES -- such as being energetic, happy, and relaxed -- are less likely to catch the common cold than people who are depressed, nervous, or angry. 
The study also found that uptight or sad people were more likely to complain of cold symptoms even when they weren't sick. 
It should be noted, however, that negative emotions were not linked to a person's risk for getting sick -- just their tendency to report symptoms of illness. 
There's also the connection to improved performance. 
Sports psychologists say it's crucial for athletes to develop positive self-talk. 
Indeed, negative thoughts are among the biggest contributors to pre-event jitters and performance anxiety. 
Athletes are told to choose simple affirmations like I feel strong, or Go, go, go, practice multiple scenarios, and create a positive mental image or visualization. 
Studies show that when athletes engage in positive self-talk, performances improve, albeit just slightly. 
Thinking positively has been shown to be effective for tasks involving relatively fine, as compared to gross, motor skills, and for novel, as opposed to well-learned tasks. 
But can the power of positive thinking really work to help us succeed at school or in the workplace? 
And can it reliably be used to help us achieve our goals and overcome even some of the most challenging hardships? 
Indeed, a good number of people believe that happy thoughts will help them get further in life. 
Ever since Rhonda Byrne published The Secret in 2006, plenty of folks have been taken with the idea that positive thoughts are rewarded with happiness, wealth, influence, wisdom, and success. 
The way to change a lack of belief is very simple, writes Byrne. 
Begin thinking the opposite thoughts to what you 've been thinking about yourself: that you can do it, and that you have everything within you to do it. 
On the face of it, Byrne's prescription makes sense. 
Having a good attitude and positive thoughts about a task or outcome should produce a stronger work ethic, increased motivation, and a sunnier outlook. 
In turn, these attitudes should result in success. 
But as marketing professor Adam Alter recently pointed out in The New Yorker, these strategies sound suspiciously familiar to techniques used by fitness gurus. 
In his article, The Powerlessness of Positive Thinking, he writes: 
Indeed, good thoughts can only get us so far in this highly competitive world. 
The facile notion that we can accomplish anything if we just adopt the right attitude flies in the face of reality and common sense. 
And as studies are increasingly showing, positive fantasies may actually lessen our chances of succeeding. 
A few decades ago, she investigated the impact of expectation and fantasy on the weight losses of 25 obese women participating in a behavioral weight reduction program. 
She presented the women with several short, open-ended scenarios about future events, and asked them to imagine how they would fare in each one. 
Some scenarios had the women imagining success, while others imagined scenarios in which they were tempted to cheat on their diets. 
Oettingen then asked the women to rate how positive or negative their resulting thoughts and images were. 
Shockingly, a follow-up survey revealed that the more positively these women had imagined themselves in these scenarios, the fewer pounds they had lost. 
Since then, Oettingen has conducted a number of similar studies -- and they all point to the same result: Fantasizing about happy outcomes hinders people from realizing their dreams. 
The problem with merely dreaming about the future and imagining that we 've reached this desired future is that we're already imagining being there -- and that saps our energy to actually understand the obstacles and hindrances that are on the way to our reaching this positive future, she told io9. 
So, we don't put in enough effort to go the hard way and deal with all the hindrances and temptations, and we also don't plan for it. 
Then, when life hits, we are often unprepared. 
The idea behind mental contrasting is that you imagine a desired future, and then you experience that desired future in your mind. 
In that way, it is like dreaming about the future, she explained. 
That gives you direction -- but it's not enough. 
Oettingen says we need to understand what's holding us back, and what actually stops us from achieving our goals. 
We need to figure out what's standing in our way and what's preventing us from going all the way. 
Essentially, mental contrasting works by connecting our future to reality. 
Or more accurately, it connects the reality and the instrumental means to overcome the reality, thus changing the meaning of reality so that the reality is now an obstacle. 
By imagining success or the attainment of a goal, and then thinking about the feasibility of achieving that goal and all the obstacles that stand in the way, we come away being more realistic, more energized, and more likely to succeed. 
Her work on healthy eating and exercise proves it. 
Another person who's skeptical of the positive thinking paradigm is American political activist Barbara Ehrenreich, author of Bright-Sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America. 
In her book, she takes on the idea that we must work on ourselves in order to be successful and optimistic. 
She first encountered this imposition when she was being treated for breast cancer. 
In a 2009 Globe and Mail interview she said: 
Ehrenreich traces the roots of the positive-thinking movement to the early part of the 19th century when people began rebelling against Calvinist sentiments about predestination and damnation. 
Since that time, people have increasingly railed against those notions, adopting a worldview which suggests we can choose to feel better about ourselves and our place in the world. 
But now, it has been diverted from being a healing method toward a way of gaining wealth and success. 
Indeed, Ehrenreich takes great issue with corporate culture, and how it uses the cult of positive thinking to mould and motivate its employees. 
As Ehrenreich points out, unsolicited admonitions to be a positive thinker can be rather off-putting when we're dealing with the hardships of life and when we're told to ignore our feelings. 
But as York University sociologist Julia Hemphill told me, the positive thinking narrative can also lead to victim blaming. 
Take for instance individuals who have experienced life-long abuse, poverty, or oppression. 
If we believe that thinking positively -- or put another way we get what we give -- determines our life circumstances, than it logically follows that certain people must likewise be responsible for the outcomes of the structural challenges that they face, she says. 
Accordingly, Hemphill says we can not just positively think away structural hardships. 
She says it's an anti-sociological perspective that distracts us from larger systemic problems. 
In this way the belief in positive thinking also functions as a way to blame victims, she says. 
Further, the status quo remains unchallenged by such thinking, as these types of sentiments serve to individualize broader social problems.

Do you want to have conversations with your customers in ways that surveys and focus groups never could? 
Social media can make that happen. 
Do you want to make your employees more productive anywhere and anytime? 
Try mobile computing. 
Do you want to understand what's really happening in your company so you can make informed decisions rather than just working by instinct? 
Big data analytics can do that. 
Do you want to kick the pants off your competitors through digital customer engagement or business model innovations? 
That can happen, too. 
In my research on digital transformation, I 've been amazed to see how many digital activities companies are undertaking, especially in non-digital industries. 
But despite all of this activity, relatively few companies were really doing it well. 
Why are some able to do amazing things with digital technologies, while others just do more of the same? 
What makes some firms digital masters while the majority of them lag behind? 
You might think it has to do with technology expertise. 
So many accounts of successful digital businesses focus on Internet startups or companies in the tech industry. 
You also might think you need to hire a hundred employees from Google or Facebook or Amazon. 
That thinking is reasonable, but it's wrong. 
For digital masters, technology is important, but it's not the most important thing. 
The critical factor turns out to be leadership. 
In a new book I coauthored with Didier Bonnet and Andrew McAfee, Leading Digital, we looked at how more than 400 large companies in traditional industries like finance, manufacturing and pharmaceuticals are using digital. 
We identified four key leadership practices for driving digital transformation. 
The first practice involves creating a transformative digital vision for the company. 
Just saying you 'll adopt digital isn't enough. 
You need to describe how the company will actually change: How will you engage differently with customers? 
How will you rethink your operations? 
What new business models are possible? 
Codelco, the world's largest copper company, is a good example of a digital master with a strong vision. 
Codelco executives are envisioning a radically new kind of copper mine -- one where humans will never need to work in the dangerous underground environment again. 
There will be plenty of jobs for miners, but all of them will be above ground. 
This vision is well on the way to reality, with autonomous trucks driving around mines, mining control centers located hundreds of miles away from the mines, and strong collaboration with vendors to push the limits of technology. 
As a result, Codelco is also pushing the economics of the industry, making it possible to harvest copper ore that would be far too dangerous and costly for humans to mine. 
Codelco is not alone. 
P&G's vision is to create digital dashboards for everything in the company, enabling employees to make decisions based on real-time data. 
And Boeing's vision puts the airplane at the center of a digital airline for which Boeing will provide many services beyond the airframe. 
Great leaders know that they can't change businesses on their own. 
They need to convince their employees to change. 
Once you have a strong vision, you need to help people figure out what it means to them and how they can play their part in making the vision a reality. 
Engaging employees in a new vision can be a tough task. 
Many employees have seen visions come and go. 
For digital masters, top leaders focus on communicating the vision and helping people know what it means to them. 
They use every channel possible from meetings to internal collaboration platforms. 
And they focus on making it a two-way conversation, where employees suggest ways to build out the vision, not just follow orders to implement. 
You can see this type of engagement at the technology giant EMC, which holds an annual innovation conference to gather great ideas for moving the company forward. 
Each year, employees share more than 4,000 ideas. 
Winners get recognition across EMC, but all participants gain from being part of the conversation. 
Of course companies can't fund every new idea. 
Leaders need to be clear about what is appropriate and what is not. 
If your vision says you will be a unified company and someone wants to fund an idea that runs counter to it, you need to think long and hard about it. 
Global media company PRISA is a good case in point. 
It built capability so that an interview with a soccer player in Argentina could be played on the news in Spain that same day. 
The company had to be very strong in saying that each business unit must work with this system ; if a unit tried to do its own process then the company wouldn't fund it. 
But governance is more than just standards and investment processes. 
The Guardian, Starbucks, and other companies have appointed a chief digital officer, a role responsible for steering governance and driving the digital conversation across the firm. 
Other firms like Nike and Lloyds Banking Group have created digital units that provide capability and some resources, making it easier to work with governance rather than against it. 
In all of the Digital Masters we studied, top business executives work closely with IT executives. 
IT leaders find ways to speak the language of the business, and business leaders find ways to include IT leaders in strategic conversations. 
This doesn't mean that IT goes unchanged. 
In many companies, IT is seen as too slow or stodgy for the fast-moving digital realm. 
IT leaders must find ways to improve the performance and speed of IT. 
Some companies choose to practice dual-speed IT, where one part of the IT unit does digital and coordinates with the rest of IT as needed. 
Others like Lloyds Bank have a digital division co-led by IT and business people. 
And in some firms like Codelco, the CIO leads digital transformation. 
Becoming a digital master isn't an overnight process. 
Digital transformation requires a long-term commitment and, above all, a focus on strong leadership. 
Companies that profit from digital see it as a leadership challenge, not a technology one. 
They understand the opportunities that digital can provide, and strive to make them real. 
And they find that each new action creates new possibilities to digitally transform their companies and industries. 
iOS 8.1.1 was released earlier this week and includes a few small bug fixes. 
It also happens to break the current version of the iOS jailbreak. 
If you updated on accident and want to keep your ability to jailbreak, iDownloadBlog shows you how. 
For the time being, Apple is still signing the iOS 8.1 firmware, which means you can still download and install it manually. 
This window won't be open long though, so if you're interested in jailbreaking, now's the time to downgrade. 
You 'll find the full guide for doing so over on iDownloadBlog. 
Albert Woodfox, the only member of the so-called Angola 3 still incarcerated, was convicted of the 1972 murder of a young prison guard named Brent Miller. 
Woodfox was found guilty along with fellow inmate Herman Wallace. 
Wallace's conviction was overturned last year as his health was failing. 
He was released from prison last October and died a few days later. 
The third member of the group was not connected to the Miller case but was held in isolation while in prison. 
When I first heard there were two individuals in solitary confinement for that long, I thought, Not in America, Woodfox' attorney George Kendall told NPR. 
When I first went to meet them I thought they would be lying on the floor like basket cases. 
It's taken every ounce of strength for them to not be broken by this thing. 
And now there's only -LSB- Woodfox. -RSB- 
The state can appeal the latest ruling in Woodfox's case to the U.S. Supreme Court or ask the full panel of appellate judges to review Thursday's decision. 
If it doesn't appeal, the state will have to re-try Woodfox for the 42-year-old murder or set him free.

The 2014 Formula One season wraps up this weekend in Abu Dhabi. 
For some like Mercedes, which cinched the constructor's championship a while back and is a lock for the driver's championship, it will be time to celebrate. 
For others like Caterham, which is so far in the hole it relied upon crowdfunding to complete the season, it will be a time to ponder the future. 
But for scores of team logisticians and DHL employees, it will be a time to relax, because they will no longer be in a mad dash to pack and ship 22 cars and a few hundred tons of equipment to the next race. 
Formula 1 is many things: an elaborate show, an engineering extravaganza and a logistical nightmare. 
There are 19 races held over eight months on six continents. 
The turnaround from one race to the next can be as short as one week. 
Each of the 11 teams will travel about 62,000 miles during the season, bringing with it two cars and roughly 50 tons of stuff. 
You name it and they're probably hauling it, from spare parts to the pots and pans used in the catering trailers. 
It's enough to fill six Boeing 747 jumbo jets, and it keeps an army of people on the road for as many as 200 days a year. 
The work starts about three hours after the checkered flag falls. 
Once the cars have been through the post-race inspection to ensure teams haven't done anything illegal to gain a competitive edge, team mechanics strip it to the last component. 
The engine and gearbox are removed, along with the front and rear wings, mirrors and suspension parts. 
Each is placed within its own foam-slotted box. 
But sometimes custom-fitted foam and an anvil-tough case isn't enough, says McLaren's Alan Field, the team's trackside support manager. 
In that case, McLaren turns to another tool: humble but steadfast bubble wrap. 
It's especially good for protecting painted surfaces, which is a prime concern because no one wants to see that glorious silvery-chrome paint or a sponsor's logo scuffed. 
The chassis is protected by its own custom-made cover, and placed within its own case. 
You wouldn't recognize it if you saw it packed up, Field says. 
All of this happens come hell or high water literally. 
The show must go on, as the saying goes, and F1 is no exception. 
This can be a headache if the next race is the following weekend F1 typically schedules races at least two weeks apart, there are four back-to-back grands prix weekends on the 2014 calendar. 
In those cases, everything has to be at the next track within 36 hours so teams have enough time to reassemble the cars and get everything sorted before practice begins Friday. 
This can require moving everything from, say, Malaysia to Bahrain in a matter of days. 
Depending on which way everyone and everything is headed, time zones can relax or tighten the schedule by several hours. 
Invariably, something comes up. 
Sometimes it's a small inconvenience, but sometimes it's a colossal nightmare like Typhoon Phanfone, which clobbered Japan during the Japanese Grand Prix. 
Everyone was working under miserable conditions -- strong winds, torrential rain and poor visibility -- but with the inaugural Russian Grand Prix just one week away in Sochi, they had to buckle down and suck it up. 
You can't just stop what you're doing because of the weather, Field says. 
You 've just got to crack on. 
Nonetheless, delays happen, and sometimes teams are left with less time than usual to get everything ready for the next race. 
That means longer hours, and sometimes bringing in extra help from the factory back home. 
The cars may get the most care, but there are several dozen tons of equipment to be packed and shipped. 
Each team carries enough spare parts to rebuild their cars, 40 sets of tires, 2,500 liters of fuel, 200 liters of motor oil and 90 liters of coolant. 
And then there are the tools. 
And the computers. 
And enough food to make as many as 200 meals, plus all the stuff needed to prepare those meals. 
And ... and ... the list goes on. 
All told, the biggest teams may be hauling as much as 50 tons of gear, and even the smallest outfits are schlepping 30 tons of stuff. 
It takes between three and six hours for the teams to pack it all up. 
Then it's all handed over to DHL, which has to get everything to the next city. 
That's no less complicated. 
A fleet of seven jumbo jets does the bulk of the work, flying stuff, in some cases, halfway around the world. 
A fleet of trucks hauls it all from the airport to the track, which can be a matter of minutes in the case of Malaysia or a few hours in the case of Brazil. 
When the action is in Europe, where there are shorter distances between tracks, DHL will truck stuff instead. 
Although there is a routine to it all, there are quirks to each race or track. 
All the breakdowns on each operation have some particularities, says Pier Luigi Ferrari, DHL's motorsport deputy managing director. 
They key to making it all go smoothly is planning, planning, and more planning. 
Preparations begin a year ahead of time, and extra attention is paid to new venues like the Sochi Autodrom that hosted the inaugural Russian Grand Prix this year. 
Ferrari says his team of roughly 80 people needs the long lead time to nail down every last detail, from what the roads are like to how to negotiate the customs bureaucracy. 
There can be a monumental amount of red tape. 
Some countries are more closed, more difficult, he says. 
Any food taken into China, Malaysia, or Singapore, for example, must first be fumigated and certified to ensure to ensure invasive species or other creatures aren't hitching a ride. 
It's a hassle, yes, but not insurmountable given enough advance notice. 
Our timing, our schedules do not allow us not to be prepared, Ferrari says. 
Not everything goes by air. 
Teams typically have five or six sets of common parts -- things like work benches, tool trolleys and the like, along with stuff like PR and marketing material -- and send them by sea. 
It's slower, but given enough sets, the teams can send them weeks in advance so they arrive in plenty of time. 
But the nature of Formula One makes perfect planning impossible. 
As race day approaches, teams inevitably make changes to their cars, or find themselves in need of a spare part left at their home base. 
Something always comes up at the last minute, and we have to be prepared as usual, Ferrari says. 
The moment an order comes in, DHL dispatches someone to fulfill it and get it on the next plane out. 
Even last-minute requests can be delivered to the track within 24 to 36 hours. 
But in F1, where everything is measured in thousandths of a second, Ferrari's crew is always looking for ways to save time. 
Usually it's given to us today, Ferrari says. 
And they expect it yesterday. 
When people talk about the next big thing, they're never thinking big enough. 
It's not a lack of imagination ; it's a lack of observation. 
I 've maintained that the future is always within sight, and you don't need to imagine what's already there. 
What's the buzz? 
The Internet of Things revolves around increased machine-to-machine communication ; it's built on cloud computing and networks of data-gathering sensors ; it's mobile, virtual, and instantaneous connection ; and they say it's going to make everything in our lives from streetlights to seaports smart. 
But here's what I mean when I say people don't think big enough. 
So much of the chatter has been focused on machine-to-machine communication M2M: devices talking to like devices. 
But a machine is an instrument, it's a tool, it's something that's physically doing something. 
When we talk about making machines smart, we're not referring strictly to M2M. 
We're talking about sensors. 
A sensor is not a machine. 
It doesn't do anything in the same sense that a machine does. 
It measures, it evaluates ; in short, it gathers data. 
The Internet of Things really comes together with the connection of sensors and machines. 
That is to say, the real value that the Internet of Things creates is at the intersection of gathering data and leveraging it. 
All the information gathered by all the sensors in the world isn't worth very much if there isn't an infrastructure in place to analyze it in real time. 
Cloud-based applications are the key to using leveraged data. 
The Internet of Things doesn't function without cloud-based applications to interpret and transmit the data coming from all these sensors. 
The cloud is what enables the apps to go to work for you anytime, anywhere. 
Let's look at one example. 
In 2007, a bridge collapsed in Minnesota, killing many people, because of steel plates that were inadequate to handle the bridge's load. 
When we rebuild bridges, we can use smart cement: cement equipped with sensors to monitor stresses, cracks, and warpages. 
This is cement that alerts us to fix problems before they cause a catastrophe. 
And these technologies aren't limited to the bridge's structure. 
If there's ice on the bridge, the same sensors in the concrete will detect it and communicate the information via the wireless internet to your car. 
Once your car knows there's a hazard ahead, it will instruct the driver to slow down, and if the driver doesn't, then the car will slow down for him. 
This is just one of the ways that sensor-to-machine and machine-to-machine communication can take place. 
Sensors on the bridge connect to machines in the car: we turn information into action. 
You might start to see the implications here. 
What can you achieve when a smart car and a smart city grid start talking to each other? 
We're going to have traffic flow optimization, because instead of just having stoplights on fixed timers, we 'll have smart stoplights that can respond to changes in traffic flow. 
Traffic and street conditions will be communicated to drivers, rerouting them around areas that are congested, snowed-in, or tied up in construction. 
So now we have sensors monitoring and tracking all sorts of data ; we have cloud-based apps translating that data into useful intelligence and transmitting it to machines on the ground, enabling mobile, real-time responses. 
And thus bridges become smart bridges, and cars smart cars. 
And soon, we have smart cities, and .... 
Okay. 
What are the advantages here? 
What are the savings? 
What industries can this be applied to? 
Here's what I mean when I say people never think big enough. 
This isn't just about money savings. 
It's not about bridges, and it's not about cities. 
This is a huge and fundamental shift. 
When we start making things intelligent, it's going to be a major engine for creating new products and new services. 
Of all the technology trends that are taking place right now, perhaps the biggest one is the Internet of Things ; it's the one that's going to give us the most disruption as well as the most opportunity over the next five years. 
In my next post in this two-part series, we 'll explore just how big this is going to be.

Websites that have worked themselves into our routines and vocabularies have begun to figure out what kind of people we are. 
By developing algorithms that track our online habits, tech companies have created online experiences that are deeply personal and self-determined. 
At its advent, the Internet was seen as the Great Equalizer -- globally, all users ostensibly had access to the same content. 
The amount of content available, however, is vast, and websites like Facebook, Netflix, and Google are overwhelmed by it. 
Tech companies have found that tracking user habits enables the creation an online universe where you only mostly see what you'd like to see, essentially determining the Internet that users are exposed to. 
Mark Zuckerberg famously told his team at Facebook that a squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa. 
Relevance is the focus of Facebook's personalization algorithm, and their team has created a world of front yards filled with dying squirrels, keeping you far away from the dying people in Africa. 
If it seems like Facebook is reading your mind, it isn't -- but their team does have a thorough understanding of how your mind works. 
The smallest aspects of your online life, from how long you linger on a photo of your ex to whose events you RSVP attending to, are compiled to create a complete picture of your ideal Facebook experience. 
This has created what The New York Times calls an online echo chamber, wherein we are all trapped in our online comfort zones. 
Google is in on the game too. 
An avid gamer searching for grand theft auto will get vastly different results from a police officer, and a person standing in the middle of Manhattan will not see the same articles as his friend in California when he searches for best sushi recommendations. 
When searching for information, whether for research, for pleasure, or for necessity, Google displays results according to their relevancy algorithm -- so what you end up reading is, usually, what you want to be reading. 
The changes we are experiencing are large-scale innovations to the way that we, as users, engage with web content. 
Netflix just announced a $ 150 million investment in recommendation systems, including the creation of a 300-person recommendation team but they say it's worth it. 
Netflix Chief Product Officer Neil Hunt recently told the audience at the Conference on Recommender Systems that the average user only browses the Netflix app for one or two minutes before making a decision, leaving the app a very limited window for engagement. 
The key for reaching a user in that time period is making sure the first thing they see is what they came to the site for or at the very least, interesting enough to keep them there. 
Netflix, at last count, had 76,897 genres listed, which is about as micro as genre-tagging can go. 
Hunt's affection for the long tail is translated as hyper-obsessive categorization, which not only contributes to effective customer targeting, but also spot-on product development. 
When conceiving their own content, Netflix has customer data so specific that it is effectively a blueprint to television success. 
And what our technology knows about us, it knows about our friends. 
Foursquare recently announced a massive overhaul to their app's structure: The app was split into two, Foursquare and Swarm, as part of a complete reenvisioning of geotagging. 
Foursquare is now the home of local recommendations, which are influenced by Swarm check-ins ; Swarm is where users plan meetups, check in to locations, and leave personal notes. 
When one takes into account the possibilities that are created by the influx of location-based platforms, the personalization of Internet enters entirely uncharted territory: The real world. 
New apps like Qork are looking to build on the foundations of these local social apps, like Swarm and Foursquare, to make personalization of local content deeper, so that two different users could experience an entirely different cities within the same app. 
As we become more dependent on technology, the ability for our online experiences to influence our real world experiences becomes less of theory and more a reality. 
We are developing an Internet that is no longer worldwide, but is completely personalized. 
Matthew Panzarino, writing for TechCrunch, sums it up best: 
What happens when a social network knows exactly what posts you 'll want to read and tells you when you can see them, and not before? 
What about a shopping app that ignores everything that you're unlikely to buy and taps you on the shoulder for only the most killer of deals? 
What about a location aware app that knows where you and all of your friends are at all times but is smart enough to know when you want people to know and when you don't? 
Foursquare can take us to a new city and show us a good time. 
Netflix can find the most indie of movies that are statistically proven winners in their genre + age group + theme + period category. 
Anywhere that a user can express an interest, they are paid back in personalized, optimized content -- and only that. 
The problem is not with the information we're receiving, but what's being left out. 
The echo chamber phenomenon is real. 
We, as users, are creating self-fulfilling prophecies every time we check into our apps ; we make our preferences known and then have them fed back to us, affirming our choices. 
By narrowing our field of experience to what we want to be experiencing, we are only being exposed to information that is relevant -- thereby making what we're seeing the only information that we feel is relevant. 
Customized content is the new way of exposing users to the whole Internet through their own experiences, habits, and interests, using information that users are often not conscious of. 
What does it say that my favorite games this year have all been radar blips I discovered weeks before their arrival? 
Games like Shovel Knight, Valiant Hearts, Entwined, Hohokum, Velocity 2X, and This War of Mine? 
Or should that be counterculture? 
The Alaskan Iñupiat, a hunter-gatherer people whose way of life the game thoughtfully channels, exemplify a society that may sound otherworldly to United Statesians. 
This, though the Iñupiat live in our 49th state and enjoy full U.S. citizenship. 
Iñupiat principles include coexistence between humans and wildlife, respect for nature, one another, and one's elders basically forging social systems that don't harm the world, sharing food, songs, dance, and stories on a communal level, and cultivating a spiritual connection with the land. 
In short, community-informed selflessness. 
Somehow Never Alone, by Alaska-based newcomer Upper One Games, manages to pull that off with a kind of narrative dignity and gameplay introspection all too rare in this medium. 
And rather than functioning as esoteric window dressing, the story's precepts actually inform the game design. 
Take cooperation, a principle Never Alone foregrounds from the start. 
You play as Nuna, a young Iñupiat girl caught in a never-ending blizzard, fleeing a cruel interloper and trying to save her village by discovering the source of the storm. 
She encounters a magical animal early on, a mysterious arctic fox who can conjure ethereal beings. 
The fox, here portrayed per northern Native American stories as the noble messenger not our archetypal trickster, is both Nuna's symbolic and functional gameplay connection to the spirit world. 
You alternate between controlling Nuna and the fox by tapping a button, or if you want to play co-op, pulling in a second player. 
Where Nuna moves slowly and can only jump limited distances, the fox is lithe and limber. 
Nuna can shift and climb on heavy objects, and wields a bola that can shatter stanchions of ice blocking your way forward, while the fox can scale or leap between sheer barriers. 
The fox can also reify spiritual entities by lingering near them, each of these serving as platforms Nuna winds up traversing on or dangling from. 
Never Alone uses these contrasts to craft artful platforming-puzzle stumpers that often involve multidirectional motion through maze-like settings inspired by Iñupiat myths. 
And that mythology really gets into your headspace, evolving from predictable Alaskan snowscapes, knockabout blizzards, and seas of boreal ice to more surreal moments. 
In some you 'll consult with owl-faced men ; in others, strange phantasmic creatures glide past you in elliptical arcs, casting eldritch light on glistening surfaces as they threaten to seize and carry you skyward. 
If Campbell was right when he argued part of mythology's function is to encourage introspection by casting us out of the here and now, let Never Alone stand as an exemplar of the principle for future game designers. 
Over the course of the game I learned about Sila the Iñupiat name for the environment, from the earth to the moon, that in Alaska they call igloos apuyyaq, and that time in extreme climates is less circadian than it is ecological. 
At one point I listened to the harrowing story of a child who almost died when swept out to sea on a piece of broken-away ice. 
These moments both ground the design principles and reinforce the game's value as a cultural teaching tool. 
Ironically, Never Alone occasionally falters when you play it by yourself. 
Whichever character you're not controlling will sometimes mistime a leap and end up dying through no fault of yours. 
But it's a rare occurrence, and the designers wisely reset you to just before each puzzle. 
So you move quickly through a relatively short game that's only mildly difficult anyway. 
Think of Never Alone as the opposite of a platformer like Shovel Knight, whose silly story what's it about again? 
you slid past to revel in the sublime controls. 
Here, the story and surroundings predominate, while most of the challenges are slower and contemplative. 
Never Alone is less a game you race than ruminate through. 
I believe players are hungry for this kind of thing, the game's writer Ishmael Hope told Gamasutra earlier this year. 
I hope he's right, because we need more experiences like this, ones that can serve both as cultural ambassadors and invite us to contemplate persuasive worldviews other than our own. 
Like the best big-fish stories, tales of your latest shootaround can be ripe with embellishment. 
There was that time you hit 14 three-pointers in a row, but no one was around to bear witness. 
The time you hit 95 out of 100 free throws, matching Jeff Hornacek's NBA-best percentage in the 1999-2000 season and coming within a rim-out of beating Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf's 1993-94 mark. 
That time you totally dunked a volleyball. 
The new ShotTracker system can help verify or debunk those claims with its sensors. 
It's a three-piece system that consists of a net-mountable sensor, a diminutive wrist sensor, and a mobile app that connects to the sensors via Bluetooth to track your makes and misses. 
The complete kit, which goes for $ 150 and ships in early December, includes a wristband with a slot for the 1-by-2-inch sensor. 
Also included is a compression sleeve if you'd rather wear the wrist sensor that way. 
There's no built-in memory on either sensor module, so you 'll need to keep your iOS or Android device near the court for your stats to be registered. 
The mobile device receives input from the wrist and net sensors via Bluetooth, caches that data if there are any connection problems, and pushes your stats to the cloud for crunching and sharing with friends and/or coaches. 
In addition to tracking your improvement in terms of buckets and bricks, the app also has a menu of workout options and lets you compete against other ShotTracker users and view their stats. 
The app features customization options for coaches, allowing them to create and share their own workout plans and simulate results using different player lineups. 
While the next-generation version of the ShotTracker will register your position on the court -- a prototype has been built that uses TDOA to pinpoint shots automatically -- this first model will map your location based on the workouts provided by the app. 
According to ShotTracker co-founder and COO Davyeon Ross, the newer auto-tracking version will be available in mid-2015 and will be able to map your location on the court to within 4 inches. 
Ross says you 'll need to recharge the lilliputian, water-resistant wrist sensor after eight hours of usage, but the net sensor gets up to three months of battery life per charge. 
The net-mounted unit is weatherproofed, and it's designed to be used on both indoor and outdoor courts. 
But can you fool the system by chucking the ball directly through the net and hitting the hoop sensor? 
Ross says it's possible, but the wrist sensor's six-axis motion tracker is programmed to make sure the shooting motion matches up. 
The system also has algorithms to ignore pump fakes, dribbles, and other non-shooting actions. 
So if you really want to fake it out, you 'll need to mimic a shooting motion while a co-conspirator shoots layups. 
Or you could hire Ray Allen to wear your wrist sensor in order to boost your beyond-the-arc stats.

The artists involved in Bright Matter, a newly opened exhibition at Muriel Guépin Gallery in NYC, aren't known for their subtleties. 
They're good at things like projection mapping onto massive architectural masterpieces, warping senses with lasers, light and sound, building large-scale installations out of tape and nets. 
So to see them subdued in a gallery setting is a little unexpected. 
In Bright Matter, they still get to do what they do best -- bend our perceptions with visual illusions -- just on a smaller, less technologically in-your-face scale. 
Curated by artist Joanie Lemercier and produced by Juliette Bibasse, the exhibition is an exploration of how we can use light, space and materials to change the way we view the world around us. 
This idea isn't new. 
For as long as art has existed, its creators have loved screwing with the way we see things. 
The cavemen at Lascaux may have used flickering firelight to make their drawings appear to move ; the Op-Art movement of the 1960s showed just how powerful simple shapes and lines could be in producing visual trickery. 
Today, artists have increasingly embraced a digital toolkit to achieve similar effects. 
In recent years, it's becoming more and more accessible and easy to manipulate light, says Lemercier, adding that technologies like projection mapping, LEDs, high resolution immersive displays have played a major role. 
By manipulating light, you can then by extension manipulate reality. 
But the work in Bright Matter shows that just because you can use code and software doesn't mean you should. 
Details can get lost in the technical flashiness -- the nuances of ideas and concepts are drowned by the sheer wow-factor of it all. 
I tend to have reached a brick wall when it comes to be ` inspired' or creative' in front of a computer screen, says Lemercier. 
The mouse and keyboard are such rigid and basic input devices, I don't feel like hitting square bits of plastic is helping me in my creative process. 
Take for example the work of Nonotak, the Parisian duo of Noemi Schipfer and Takami Nakamoto best known for their geometric projection-mapped installations. 
In Bright Matter they 've translated their same optical idea into simple, analog pieces made from vinyl tape arranged on a transparent piece of plexiglass. 
As you walk by the pieces, they produce a subtle moiré effect using the wall behind them. 
Similarly, François Wunschel of 1024 Architecture has moved from large-scale architectural installations to creating a triptych of black and white wireframe cubes. 
The lenticular prints have a depth that creates motion as you change your vantage point. 
LAb -LSB- au -RSB- of Belgium has taken a slightly different approach, creating a kinetic cluster of paper triangles that changes forms via mini motors. 
As has Numen For/Use, the design studio responsible for massive tape and netted installations. 
The studio is showing Trapezium, a grid of fluorescent tubes that are housed in spy glass to create what feels like a miniature version of an infinity room. 
Lemercier himself has scaled back from his epic projection-mapped installations, instead backlighting laser-cut paper to bring his algorithmically-created landscapes to life. 
For a generation of ADD culture consumers, this departure can be challenging -- Where are the flashing lights !? 
Where's the booming music ?! 
But like so many things in life, expending a little bit of effort often produces the most interesting results. 
As Lemercier succinctly sums it up: Working without any of the obvious tricks makes me work harder. 
You know how in 1997's Batman and Robin Mr. Freeze shows up and starts blasting everyone with his weird blue ice and making bad puns? 
I feel like that happened in America this week, somewhere, and we just haven't found out about it yet.

Also I get the films of Joel Schumacher confused with reality. 
In some ways, snow is the great equalizer.

Or, maybe not!

Again. 
And Mat learns how to take a drink in front of a microphone. 
For the first time since 2002, the Texas State Board of Education voted to adopt a new generation of social studies products. 
That includes some 89 textbooks, workbooks and other classroom materials. 
The vote matters because, with some five million students, the state has a big impact on the national textbook market. 
As for what's in the books, that wasn't entirely clear until today. 
Activists and academics across the political spectrum took issue with the way some subjects were handled, and the process allowed them to lobby for changes until the last minute. 
Consider one high school government textbook. 
It lists four thinkers who influenced the Founding Fathers. 
Three of those on the list make a lot of sense: John Locke, Montesquieu and Blackstone. 
Those are all either British philosophers or Enlightenment thinkers, says Jennifer Graber, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin. 
She says that these three thinkers are all quoted in America's founding documents. 
But, for Graber, the fourth person on the list raised a red flag: Moses. 
I think for many of us who are academic historians, it's a very a-historical connection to make. 
Moses is not someone who is quoted in the founding documents, Graber says. 
The standards are called the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills and were created in 2010. 
They state that high school students in U.S. government are expected to identify the individuals, whose principles of laws and government institutions informed the American founding documents, including those of Moses, William Blackstone, John Locke, and Charles de Montesquieu. 
Moses was not a Founding Father. 
However, I believe he did influence our Founding Fathers, says Ken Mercer, R-San Antonio. 
The standards suggest that slavery was only the third most important contributing factor to the Civil War which we all know is ridiculous, says Kathy Miller, president of the Texas Freedom Network, a left-leaning watchdog group. 
It contracted scholars at various universities to review the books. 
The review found that, at first, some publishers followed Texas' lead, downplaying slavery's role in the Civil War and emphasizing states' rights. 
But, after a long public review process and many complaints, they made changes. 
Revisions have helped shaped these books. 
In fact, publishers were submitting changes even this morning, hours before the final vote. 
Some members complained that they didn't have enough time to review all the changes. 
So, the board decided to accept all revisions submitted by 5 p.m. Thursday and to review subsequent changes in February. 
And one national publisher, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, withdrew a U.S. government textbook at the last minute. 
In a statement, the publisher said the book was for a national program and didn't meet all of the Texas standards. 
Another point of contention: climate change. 
Josh Rosenau, programs and policy director with the National Center for Science Education, took issue with its characterization in books by mega publishers Pearson and McGraw-Hill. 
They were saying we didn't know what was causing climate change or saying that scientists were divided about whether humans were responsible, Rosenau says. 
And that was just not true. 
And that has some Texas education leaders on edge. 
To make sure they don't end up with materials designed for other states and other standards, the state government actually outlawed the Common Core in 2013. 
Kali is a great tool for testing the security of your network and the operating system works on just about everything that can run Linux. 
That includes the Raspberry Pi. 
What's even better is a new distribution that brings along support for a touchscreen. 
The special distribution is built for 2.8 touch screens. 
This means you 'll find a special GUI interface built for touch and the small screen. 
It's likely a little clunky and hard to use, but the pocket-sized nature of it means you can keep it around without wasting a lot of space. 
Head over to Offensive Security to grab a copy of the distribution. 
Why settle for a vape pen that can only handle oils, waxes, loose-leaf or e-liquids when one pen can do it all? 
Multimode pens are getting easy to find, and they're quickly dropping down to double-digit prices. 
Problem is, a lot of them perform like you bought them at a 99-cent store. 
Too many are manufactured by fly-by-night firms and utilize components chosen for discount pricing rather than performance. 
So how do you find a portable vape that's durable and powerful enough for everyday use, adaptable enough to meet your ever-changing toking requirements and affordable enough to not break your budget? 
You keep reading, that's how. 
When it comes down to it, vaporizers are basically just portable miniature ovens: a battery pack provides power to the heating element which gently cooks the botanical material in its heating chamber until the active ingredients vaporize and travel up an airway into your mouth. 
Easy? 
For one, you can just as easily use the device while it's plugged in and charging. 
What's more, it heats from stone cold to 475 degrees Farenheit in just over a minute. 
That's quite speedy. 
It's made from high density plastic that can withstand being dropped onto concrete from waist-high, utilizes a convection heating element that toasts your botanicals cleanly and evenly without singeing, and delivers the vapor through an aluminum air path that doesn't impart any added taste to the vapor. 
The coolest feature, though, is the optional water pipe attachment that sits over the mouthpiece. 
Like a portable version of the bulky Cloud EVO, it produces super-clean, water-cooled vapor. 
As we 've discussed previously, the $ 60 V2 Pro is one sleek little vaporizer and even after testing plenty of others designed to do essentially the same thing, this unit stands out from the pack for its e-liquid abilities in terms of cartridge capacity, unit durability, vapor quality, and general ease of use. 
Its 650 mAh battery is decent enough as an e-liquid vape maybe half a day with moderate use but does drain more quickly when heating loose-leaf. 
There's a lot to love about the Ago G5. 
If it weren't for the e-liquid canister's penchant for disassembling itself in my pocket, I'd recommend it even more highly. 
The G5 incorporates an incredibly helpful LCD display that not only monitors the battery charge but also counts how many puffs you take between charges. 
This thing is great -- I know exactly how much charge I have left, which means I rarely get stranded with a dead battery. 
The 650 mAh battery is on par with the one in the V2 Pro, lasting about half a day between charges and moderate use. 
Unfortunately, it also uses low-quality coiled-wire heating elements for both the wax and loose-leaf cans. 
Those often led to uneven heating, scorched buds, and required I continually clean the cans. 
Luckily you can pick up a G5 starter kit for the ludicrously low price of $ 40. 
The $ 60 Dube2 was far and away the smallest and most easily concealed unit I tested, measuring a mere half-inch in diameter. 
It's the Benson and Hedges of portable vapes. 
But it holds less than 2 ml of e-liquid or hash, and literally a single hit's worth of loose-leaf. 
You 'll likely wind up spending more time trying to load the damn thing than you 'll ever spend vaping from it. 
I was so enamored with the Thunder when I first reviewed it. 
Not so much now that I 've broken all three wax canisters -- some after the first use -- and cracked an e-liquid tank after dropping it 10 inches onto carpet. 
At $ 7 a pop, that gets pricey fast. 
The durability isn't what I'd hoped. 
The Atmos Dart is sturdily built, rugged, and only rarely leaked nico-juice while in my pocket. 
But the battery life is unforgivable. 
The longest session it could muster was 24 minutes of absent minded puffing 3-4 draws/minute. 
It also took two full hours to recharge. 
Dealbreaker. 
The DaVinci Ascent is a very functional dual-material vaporizer that accommodates both loose-leaf and waxes. 
It's got long battery life and long charge times and an all-glass pathway. 
But even Mr. Magoo can tell this isn't a vape pen. 
The predecessor of the DLX, the Pro sports many of the same specs including size, weight, and battery life. 
It does not, however, have a six-stage heating element, only a two. 
You can likely pick one up at a discount, but if you can afford it, go for the newer DLX model. 
The Zema Pro is a serviceable 3-in-1 from Got Vape. 
It's relatively inexpensive, utilizes a slick Pyrex mouthpiece atop an aluminum air path, and is easy to use but just doesn't get me excited enough to warrant dropping $ 90 on it. 
Remember how Sub Zero and Scorpion from Mortal Kombat were basically the same character, just with different finishing moves and swapped color palettes? 
Those two had less in common than these short-lived, leaky clones. 
Just like the Ago G5, except without the useful LCD screen. 
It does use standard 510 threading, mind you, so you can easily swap in larger batteries and more robust, aftermarket canisters if you so choose. 
If you got your first real six string at the Five and Dime and you and you and some guys from school got together to record some songs primarily during and around the summer of 1969, you probably could have used the Mikme. 
The Mikme is a box-shaped microphone that can sit anywhere in the room and record, the creator claims, audiophile-quality sound wirelessly. 
It connects to a phone or tablet and streams the audio to a recording app live. 
The creator, Philipp Sonnleitner, is an electric engineer with six years experience at AKG. 
He is building the Mikme in Munich and will be shipping in May. 
I am a musician, said Sonnleitner. 
I was frustrated by how long it took me to get something recorded. 
I wanted to have fun while making music and not time wasting setup stuff up. 
And all microphones looked boring and old fashioned. 
I wanted something which looks nice beneath my stuff. 
The microphone itself has a 1-inch gold-plated condensor that converts 96kHz at 24 bits. 
It has a cardioid polar pattern and is good for recording voice or instruments -- even a whole band, if aimed correctly. 
Microphones are pretty old fashioned. 
They look, feel and behave like the ones 30 years ago. 
We are concentrating and focusing on the creative workflow, meaning artists should be able to focus on writing songs and being creative. 
Right now setting up a microphone takes too long. 
Even if it is a USB microphone you still need a cable, setting up a software, making updates, setting gains manually, selecting inputs and drivers ... and then your inspiration has gone, said Sonnleitner. 
He is looking to raise $ 217,000 -- a pretty hard-core amount -- and he's selling the units for $ 179 for early birds. 
The device has 8GB on board and can record directly to the on-board memory or an 8 track recorder. 
Who knows? 
Maybe you can stand with it on your momma's porch and sing about how the summer feels like it could last forever the summer of' 69, that is.

Value: Rue may not have known it at the time, but her brief friendship with Katniss was a major catalyst for the Mockingjay's eventual rise. 
Indispensable. 
And so adorable. 
Value: These scenes, and everything they stand for. 
The Quarter Quell would have been a snooze without Mason to put a sting in them. 
Value: He may be a drunk bastard, but Haymitch keeps Peeta and Katniss above ground. 
His charmingly combative relationship also lightens the mood in really murdery situations. 
Value: President Snow might be the scariest person in Panem, but Caesar is the damn craziest. 
The Games would be a basic affair without his maniacal charm. 
Value: Just when we thought it was impossible to look away from Katniss, Finnick walked in and said with secrets -- then immediately became essential. 
He's by far the most compelling Games victor, and the torch he holds for Annie gives him so many bonus points. 
Value: If it was possible to win a Hunger Games based purely on fabulous, Cinna would be the infinity victor. 
Also, he lit the Girl On Fire. 
Value: Beetee is deceptively intelligent and cool as a cucumber under extreme duress. 
This is a guy you absolutely want on your side in a rotating wheel of death. 
Value: Thread hasn't gotten a whole lot of screen time, but when he shows up he's terrifying. 
The word Peace might be in his title, but this guy dishes out punishment like he'd do it for free. 
A bad guy worthy of employ by President Snow. 
Value: All she needed were these grieving tears to become an MVP. 
She cried. 
We cried. 
Then District 11 got on board with the revolution. 
Value: The highest-ranking double agent in the Capitol. 
Pretty crucial. 
Value: His motives may not have been as pure as Mags', but one act of mercy by Thresh kept Katniss alive in her first Hunger Games. 
Big ups to Thresh. 
Value: Much like Gale, Peeta should probably be higher on this list, but besides being sweet and all that he's also pretty boring. 
Because he keeps saving Katniss, though, he's not at the bottom. 
Value: Overall, this guy was kind of a dud. 
He's near the basement of this list because it's not like he got to keep his job, and spared the absolutely bottom because of that beard. 
Value: She may single-handedly bring down this entire franchise by being lifeless at every turn. 
You're the reason all this is happening, girlfriend. 
Show some spunk! 
First revealed earlier this summer, Hasbro's latest version of the most iconic spaceship in the Star Wars universe is finally available to add to your collection. 
The two-and-a-half-foot long Millennium Falcon toy if you can even call it that at this scale is packed with details and believe it or not is powered solely by imagination -- no batteries required. 
Available exclusively from Walmart -- a real-life version of the Empire -- the ship features a moving radar dish and a cannon on top that pivots and turns, in addition to intricate detailing that make this almost look like a film prop. 
A few hours with an airbrush and you could probably get it pretty close to the models stored in Lucasfilm's archive. 
You might expect this monstrosity to cost well north of $ 100, but surprisingly it's just $ 60. 
Why so cheap? 
It's a case of what you see is what you get because there's nothing inside this Falcon, and it doesn't even open to accommodate any figures. 
So anyone wanting to hitch a ride is going to have to climb on top and hold on tight.

A bus in Britain is making headlines for running on gas -- and we're not talking about petroleum or natural gas. 
The Bio-Bus runs on biomethane gas that's produced by human sewage and food waste. 
The Bio-Bus has 40 seats and a range of around 186 miles on a full tank. 
When it officially goes into service next week, it 'll run as a shuttle between the city of Bath and the Bristol airport, along with other routes. 
It's not hard to imagine the Bath Bus Company's newest power source prompting jokes. 
But the firm is touting the renewable benefits of the project, wrapping the Bio-Bus in a graphic cartoon that shows a row of people sitting on toilets. 
While the poo bus is a first in Britain, the biomethane idea took hold in Norway several years ago. 
It's also been used in Germany and Sweden. 
The U.S. Energy Department prefers to call biomethane renewable natural gas. 
The agency says that while use of the resource is on a smaller scale here than in Europe, several projects are under way, in California and Indiana. 
The 10-5 vote in the Republican-controlled panel was along party lines. 
The Texas Tribune has more: 
Critics on both the left right have opposed the books. 
Among the controversial portions are sections on climate change, Islam and the role of religion in the U.S. 
Worldview Software was the only publisher to have its books rejected. 
Members on the panel cited concerns over errors. 
One reason the Ebola virus is so terrifying is that it's so lethal. 
Researchers estimate that the strain circulating in West Africa is killing upwards of 70 percent of those it infects. 
And even among those getting care, as many as 64 percent are dying. 
But some doctors in Sierra Leone say it doesn't have to be that way. 
An Ebola treatment facility in the capital of Freetown claims to have improved the odds of survival -- with little resources or money. 
Sierra Leone's government set up the Hastings Ebola Treatment Center in some classrooms at a former police training academy. 
It's payday when we visit, and the workers lined up to get their wages seem particularly animated. 
But the lively atmosphere also reflects the broader mood here. 
In the midst of a lot of bad news about Ebola -- a surge of new infections, way more patients than space to treat them -- the workers at this facility feel like they're finally having some success. 
We said, ` No, this can not continue. 
We need to do something,' says Dr. Santigie Sesay, who coordinates treatment at the center. 
At a brainstorming session, staff zeroed in on a key problem: dehydration. 
People with Ebola are wrecked with diarrhea. 
They vomit. 
They may bleed. 
But the usual way to replace fluids is an intravenous drip. 
And it can be dangerous to insert a needle into an Ebola patient. 
All it takes is one prick to infect a health worker. 
Plus, running IVs takes careful monitoring. 
So Sesay was advised against IVs. 
During our training, we were told that we are not supposed to to go into the vein, he says. 
To date none of the workers have gotten infected. 
And the effect on patients has been dramatic, Sesay says. 
It's difficult to pinpoint survival statistics for any one center when the overall number of patients is small, and the outbreak is still unfolding. 
But based on the data so far, Sesay says, Hastings' death rate is way down. 
Sesay has also noticed another effect. 
The medical staff at the center realize the patients have a fighting chance. 
Everybody has become very, very enthusiastic, he says. 
The staff started interacting with the patients more, even helping the weakest ones eat. 
We started talking to the patients, Sesay says. 
We even started bed-bathing our patients ... we became so motivated, and things changed drastically. 
I fell in love with her, Koroma says. 
I love her like my Aunt. 
She was so sick, so weak, Koroma says. 
I encouraged her: ` Please you have to for you family. 
You have your daughter.' 
The moment is bittersweet. 
These people have survived Ebola, but a lot of them have lost close relatives. 
One women in the area lifts up a baby high into the air. 
He's tiny. 
Both of the baby's parents have died of Ebola. 
The woman has been caring for him even though she doesn't know the little boy's name. 
I call him Mohammed, she says. 
The woman has two children of her own, waiting on the outside of Hasting's treatment center. 
Her kids, at least, will be getting their mom back soon. 
For Joel Bowman, decades of bike commuting started feeling like hard work. 
So the 66-year-old Atlanta resident recently switched to an electric bicycle and now when he rides Bowman feels like the wind is at his back. 
An e-bike looks a lot like a regular bike, but with an integrated electric motor, and it doesn't burn gasoline like an old-fashioned moped. 
As you pedal, an e-bike gives you a powered boost when you need it. 
Bike commuting is still rare in America's cities, but those who do it have a special bond. 
At least in Atlanta, Bowman says. 
I wan na say, the biking community here, I love it, Bowman says. 
There's a lot of waving and a lot of high-fiving going on among bikers. 
I like being part of that. 
He's getting ready to ride the six miles to his job at Emory University. 
He's been doing this ride for decades, but as he got older the ride got harder. 
So he switched to an e-bike. 
The real contrast is the old bike, somethings I got a little, ` Arghh, I got ta bike home, I'm tired,' he says. 
This, I just look forward to being on because it is pure fun. 
E-bike riding feels like a back wind pushing you up a hill as you pedal. 
On a straight road you can reach up to 20 miles an hour, depending on how hard your legs are moving. 
The bike is adjustable, so you always have the option of a no-sweat ride. 
Ed Benjamin, chairman of the Light Electric Vehicle Association, says U.S. e-bike sales doubled between 2012 and 2013. 
Still, sales of 200,000 e-bikes are a fraction of the 16 million bicycles sold last year. 
E-bikes can cost anywhere from several hundred to several thousand dollars. 
Typically, that's two to three times the price of a similar bike without the electronics. 
Most U.S. e-bike customers are older. 
Benjamin wants to change that. 
That's kind of what happened in Europe. 
Take Holland, where the elderly have been riding e-bikes for a decade. 
Then younger people started buying them a couple of years ago, and now e-bike commuters are forcing discussions of widening bike lanes. 
E-bikes contributed to that, he adds. 
It's a trend that started with elderly people and not like the usual new trends that start with young people. 
E-bikes make up a growing 20 percent market share in Holland and plenty of sportier models for younger commuters are being offered. 
More and more families in Europe are trading in their second car for an e-bike. 
And it's great, he says. 
I know I can now basically stay with this biking community for a long time with this bike. 
Technology that can age wine within minutes sounds like it belongs in the same too-good-to-be-true boat as those ads for that one food that kills belly fat. 
But the inventor behind a device that claims to do just that, the Sonic Decanter, recently invited to me to test out this fantastical technology. 
Does it work? 
As it turns out, tasting a bunch of wines is fun either way. 
By zapping your bottle with ultrasonic frequencies, the creators of the decanter say it softens the tannins and expels the sulfur dioxide -- the stuff added by winemakers to preserve the wine longer, even though it can change the way cheaper bottles taste. 
It appears that the changes we generate in 15 to 20 minutes are the same changes that occur in the components of the wine when they bottle age for five to eight years, says Mike Coyne, the creator of the device, over the phone. 
Basically, it sounds like alchemy for wine. 
Of course, alchemy has a thousand-year history of parting fools with their money. 
And drunk fools? 
Easy pickins! 
Needless to say, I was and remain skeptical of the science behind the decanter. 
But as a cheap wine drinker I was eager to try it out, and when Coyne's team offered to send me a prototype -- which will retail for $ 250 when it ships next year -- I said yes. 
Coyne started out in the beverage business but got into the wine industry more than a decade ago. 
He heard about the ultrasonic wine theory through a scientist friend, and it's taken him and his partners three years to develop the device. 
Coyne couldn't tell me the frequency the decanter runs at because it's proprietary to his company, Dionysus Technology Concepts. 
At too high of a frequency, ultrasound can toast the wine. 
Too low, it doesn't do much at all. 
It took years of tweaks to get it right. 
Though no ultrasonic tech for wine has made it to the mainstream, it's been kicking around for decades. 
The technology first saw interest in the 1960s, where it was studied at the University of California Davis, and food and beverage companies have used the tech in various ways for years. 
But it's struggled to find a foothold in the wine industry at large. 
Another ultrasonic decanter floundered in 2008, after the creator of that device made wild promises about the technology, claiming his gadget could take your run-of-the-mill # 3.99 bottle of plonk and turn it into a finest bottle of vintage tasting like it costs hundreds. 
Coyne doesn't go nearly that far. 
He describes the device as a way to subtly boost the taste of inexpensive wines -- not a magical way to turn $ 10 in $ 350. 
According to him, a comparative analysis of 300 samples done by a large independent wine laboratory they couldn't name the exact lab because of existing NDA resulted in a 15 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide and reduced the acidity levels in the wine's pH. Those changes are supposed to translate into a more drinkable wine: Less acrid, less acidic, and more complex. 
Still, I was skeptical that zapping a wine with high frequency waves could do anything more than trigger the placebo effect which is particularly placebo-y when you're on your second glass of $ 8 chardonnay. 
Coyne wasn't surprised. 
He told me he's used to the skepticism from colleagues. 
I have a lot of friends in the wine industry, and they're like ` Come on, Mike. 
What is this thing? 
,' he laughs. 
And I tell them ` let's just try it.' 
To do just that, I rounded up a couple of wine drinkers, if not connoisseurs, who graciously agreed to brave the 0-degree weather for the promise of near-bottomless free wine. 
Using the decanter is easy -- a plus, given that you 'll be operating it while consuming alcohol -- and the zapping takes two steps. 
First, pour two cups of cold water into the decanter and put the open bottle in the canister. 
Then press the red or white button depending on the wine. 
The decanter's LED face blinks on and a high, thin, chk-chk-chk-ing continues for 15 minutes for white and 20 minutes for red. 
Then imbibe. 
I had tried the decanter on several bottles myself, but I was interested in finding out whether a group of drinkers could even tell the difference between the pre - and post-zapped wine, so I set up a very, deeply unscientific blind taste taste. 
We tried three wines: A $ 13 chardonnay that most of the group drinks frequently, a $ 14 cabernet sauvignon none of us had ever tried, and a Whole Foods $ 3 bottle of merlot that we drink often because ... Whatever, don't judge. 
It turned out that 75 percent of us preferred the zapped versions of both reds. 
The taste was noticeably smoother, with less of the acrid bite that the straight-out-of-the-bottle wine. 
The white tasted different too -- but in this case, half of us chose the zapped bottle and half of us preferred the original. 
Perhaps because of the fruity, tart notes that already existed in the chard, they simply tasted like two different wines. 
Of course, our tiny sample size tells us virtually nothing about the overall effectiveness of the decanter. 
But anecdotally, the wine did taste pretty different -- it wasn't as acidic or harsh as the fresh stuff, and you could taste more layers and notes. 
The most common comment was that the wines tasted truly, distinctly different once they'd been dunked in the decanter, whether or not the end product was more or less preferable. 
I had gone into the test a skeptic, and emerged as a slightly drunk believer in the claim that this gadget actually does change the taste of wine. 
Does the science behind the decanter check out? 
Without evidence, it's impossible to say. 
But to us, it tasted different. 
But that's the thing about wine, and about taste in general: It's subjective. 
This is an industry built on manipulating the way we perceive its product, either through suggestion, price point, or even something as simple as label design. 
In that light, the Sonic Decanter seems like less of a gimmick and more like a novel application of a technology to an already deeply subjective experience. 
Coyne has no pretensions about his device, either. 
He told me that he imagines people using it almost as a party game, like Twister or charades -- a way to enhance the experience of drinking wine, not a way to spin gold out of hay. 
And rather than marketing it to œnophiles who buy $ 300 bottles, he sees it as an investment for people who buy inexpensive wine: If you think it makes that cheap wine taste even $ 10 better, the decanter would pay for itself after 25 bottles. 
In short, it's impossible to say this thing truly does what its creators claim, but it's pretty fun to try to taste the difference. 
Either way, you're drinking wine you already like, so it could be worse. 
The Sonic Decanter has already reached its goal on Kickstarter, and Coyne hopes to ship in 2015. 
If you're into wine gadgets and want to test your own tastebuds, check it out. 
Stringer uses strings to shuffle music. 
You start a string with a song then Stringer builds out a shuffled set of songs. 
Then you can add, move, and delete songs as you go. 
This way, you can easily listen to a few more songs on an album, add similar songs, and whatever else without messing up the flow of the shuffle. 
If you're willing to pay the $ 4.99 in-app upgrade fee, you can also tag songs as favorites, hide songs, save strings, and access a related artists feed. 
It's a nice way to curate your shuffled music feed while still keeping the fun of listening to music on shuffle.

Dennis Ritchie is gone. 
And Bell Labs is no longer the force it once was. 
But you can still visit them on the net. 
In the classic video above, Ritchie is among those who pitch Bell Labs to potential recruits somewhere towards the tail end of its heyday, in the ’70s and on into the ’80s. 
It's a small window into an operation that changed the world. 
Bell Labs gave us the transistor, the basic building block for all modern computers. 
And later, Ritchie and his colleague Ken Thompson built the UNIX operating system and the C programming language, two things that provide the foundation for so much of the technology we use today, from the iPhone to massive web services like Google and Facebook. 
The video comes from the American telephone giant then known as Ma Bell, the monopoly that would eventually gave way to companies like Verizon, the modern AT&T, and Alcatel Lucent, which runs Bell Labs today. 
It's a far cry from the pitch engineers now get from the likes of Google and Facebook. 
But that's part of its charm. 
It doesn't promise perks like ping pong tables or kegorators -- those mainstays in the modern world of tech innovation. 
Instead, employees pitch more mature things like getting paid to complete a master's degree in engineering and raising kids in Columbus, Ohio, where Bell Labs had a satellite office. 
But the real pitch is the work itself. 
The work is exciting, Ritchie says, because the people are exciting. 
Yes, it feels like stock chatter. 
But history would prove him right, and today's tech companies might be able to learn a thing or two from the old Bell approach. 
That said, it wasn't all work and no play at Bell. 
They video also shows off a little outdoor bowling. 
Think of it as the ping pong of its day. 
We need more stories and books that treat Mexican immigrants as humans -- novel idea, right? 
But far too often, the media and authors cast them as sinners or saints, with little deviation from cliches established decades ago. 
I think nuance and complexity form the big beautiful heart of Mexican immigration, Quinones writes in the introduction to Antonio's Gun, and they are what I seek. 
What epics he found! 
-LSB- Zeus' team -RSB- was the best team in the Zapoteco region of Oaxaca, Quinones writes, though no player was over five-foot nine. 
Their practices consisted of running uphill for two hours every day with bike-tire tubes filled with sand tied around their ankles ... 
And it's in Quinones' telling that Americans can learn the truth: Mexicans here aren't returning to Mexico. 
They may say they seek retirement in their ancestral villages, but America's promise gave them visions bigger than what they left. 
It's a situation that, Quinones writes, has enough irony for a Chekhov story. 
Jello shots have become a tasty staple for parties all over. 
To get the perfect balance of flavor and texture, it all comes down to a strong binding gelatin and using the right booze. 
In her book Jelly Shot Test Kitchen, Michelle Palm takes the college party classic and ups the ante. 
Jello shots are a gelatin, obviously, so that means that it's all held together with polymers and colloids. 
Strengthening their connection is key to right taste and consistency, so Palm suggests you do two things: 
Strengthen the gel itself so more booze can be added without sacrificing taste. 
To make it stronger, it needs to be properly hydrated. 
Soak the powder in a bowl of water to ensure there is no dry gelatin trapped in a bubble, and once it has become a slurry, heat it until the texture becomes consistent.Through experimentation, find the best ratio for your recipe while using mid-range spirits, not the cheap stuff. 
Better taste means that you can have a higher alcohol to water ratio which is the point. 
Start with 2/3 cup of water to every 2/3 cup of booze, and work your way from there. 
It also doesn't hurt to try pairing liquors to flavors, like tequila for lime jello, coconut rum for pineapple, and whipped cream vodka with cherry. 
So get to your lab budding mixologists and develop the perfect shot for your party this weekend. 
It's been over a year-and-a-half since documents leaked by Edward Snowden shook our sense of privacy to the core. 
Those documents proved that government is spying on us pretty much all the time. 
And now that we know Congress isn't going to do anything about it right away, it's time to find the tools to protect yourself. 
Detekt is a good one. 
The free, open source PC-only software is designed to spot malware infection caused by surveillance. 
Developed by security researcher Claudio Guarnieri, Detekt has the support of Amnesty International, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Privacy International. 
So it's not just some trick to scare you into buying security software. 
Detekt is here to help you protect yourself from the government's prying eyes -- not to mention anybody else that's trying to spy on you. 
It's worth pointing out that Detekt does not claim to be a catch-all solution. 
The EFF's Eva Galperin explains, Because Detekt is a best-effort tool and spyware companies make frequent changes to their software to avoid detection, users should keep in mind that Detekt can not conclusively guarantee that your computer is not compromised by the spyware it aims to detect. 
However, that should not stop you from downloading Detekt and scanning your PC. 
After all, it's free!

Great Scott! 
Did you know that Back to the Future was never supposed to have a sequel? 
Imagine that reality for a second -- a world without Marty McFly's hoverboard and shoes and flying DeLorean? 
The mind reels! 
We'd never designed the first Back To The Future to have a sequel. 
The flying car at the end was a joke, a great payoff. 
We thought this would be really hard to unravel and do again. 
But when you make a movie that's as successful as Back To The Future, it becomes this piece of corporate real estate. 
It becomes bigger than you as a filmmaker. 
You're basically given a decision: we're making a sequel, do you want to be involved in it or not? 
So we felt we had to protect our work. 
So there you have it. 
The flying car at the end of the first Back to the Future was supposedly just a throw-away joke. 
But consider me at least somewhat skeptical. 
Zemeckis has lied to us before. 
Damn you Zemeckis! 
Where's my hoverboard ?!!?! 
Here's a protip: Don't do what Uber did this week. 
That's the main topic of CrunchWeek this time around. 
Bad behavior, however, wasn't just Uber's purview: The corporate entity behind Barbie was exposed for publishing a wantonly sexist tract that undercut the idea that women can be software engineers. 
So that wasn't very good. 
Happily, TechCrunch's Ryan Lawler and Sarah Buhr were on hand to tell a few jokes, and riff on the news. 
The Fire TV Stick works. 
That's about all there is to it. 
It streams videos from Amazon, Netflix and more. 
It plays simple games and streams from local network shares. 
But it's not for everyone. 
There are better products on the market for some users. 
That said, the Fire TV Stick is well worth its $ 40 price tag. 
This is the Fire TV Stick, not to be confused with the Fire TV. 
It's $ 40 and another device in Amazon's growing stable of Trojan horses. 
While appearing innocent and offering a bevy of 3rd party streaming apps like Netflix and ESPNgo, the Fire TV Stick is just another device to sell Amazon content. 
But a damn good one, too. 
The Fire TV Stick is the little brother to the Fire TV. 
Where the latter is a full-fledged streaming device complete with optical output and a quad-core CPU, the Fire TV Stick takes a decidedly more casual approach. 
As the name suggests, it's just a stick like Google's Chromecast or the Roku Streaming Stick. 
It plugs into an HDMI port and is powered by microUSB. 
The device works as advertised. 
There's not much to say besides that. 
Plug it into an HDMI port and it powers up. 
After sitting through a 5 minute video explaining the ins-and-outs of the system, the Fire TV Stick is ready to go. 
Click a movie or TV show and it starts streaming. 
Select an app and it works. 
Sadly, it doesn't work as well as the big brother, though. 
There's a bit of lag and hesitation while navigating items on the Fire TV stick. 
The navigation is smooth enough, but not silky smooth like on the full fledged Fire TV. 
The lack of the quad-core CPU will be noticeable to users of the Fire TV. 
The Stick also lacks the Ethernet port, optical output and the ability to search by voice from the remote although Amazon will happily sell Stick owners the voice remote. 
The Fire TV Stick shares an operating system and user interface with the Fire TV. 
It's logical and easy to jump right in -- if you're an Amazon Prime subscriber. 
The Fire TVs are foremost a way to watch content from Amazon Instant Video. 
All the content displayed throughout the main menu is from Amazon. 
The search function only returns results from Amazon as well. 
If you want to watch or search within Netflix, the app has to be running. 
Only having access to Amazon Instant Video from the homescreen isn't a big deal, really. 
The library is comparable to Netflix and now has HBO's back catalog. 
And Netflix and others are just a click away. 
Have a Fire TV in the living room and a Fire TV Stick in the bedroom on the same account? 
They will share a watch history and watchlist as long as their on the same Amazon Prime account. 
Start a video in the livingroom and you 'll be able to finish it in the bedroom. 
Amazon packaged a basic remote with the Fire TV Stick right. 
It sports the necessities such as navigation and media playback buttons. 
A dedicated voice search button is absent, but will be available on the upcoming Fire TV companion app. 
During my testing, I found the lack of the voice search startling. 
Having used a Fire TV since its release, I never knew how much I leaned on that function. 
It's still possible to search on the Fire TV Stick, but only with a clunky on-screen keyboard. 
The Fire TV Stick is directly competing with the Roku Streaming Stick and Google's Chromecast. 
But they're for different people. 
Chromecast is great for the mobile aficionado -- someone who lives on their mobile device. 
It's not ideal for a multi-person environment with children where a dedicated remote and an interface on a TV is just easier to navigate. 
The Roku Streaming Stick stick is a great alternative to the Fire TV Stick. 
It offers more streaming stations than Amazon's device. 
If a person just has Netflix or Hulu Plus, the Roku is the best bet. 
But if a person also has Amazon, the Fire TV Stick simply has a better interface for viewing Amazon's selection and the rest of the apps are available like on a Roku device. 
At $ 40 the Fire TV Stick is a great buy for an Amazon household. 
The library selection rivals Netlfix. 
It's true, the $ 100 Fire TV is a better device, but for $ 60 less, a person gains access to the same content and experience. 
And I can deal with a touch of lag if I'm saving $ 60. 
YouTuber DaveHax explains in this video how to set yourself up for blade-less rope cutting. 
Make a mark on the rope or string of where you want the cut to be, then lay it on the ground so you can hold it in place with your feet. 
Make sure your mark is in the middle, grab whatever slack you have, string it under the mark, and pull until it's taut. 
Now start sawing as demonstrated. 
This works well on nylon rope and string, but it's possible on other types if the strand isn't too thick. 
Tools are much more efficient, but now you're prepared for any circumstance. 
Iranian news reports had earlier said Zarif was returning to Tehran for further instructions. 
And Kerry had been scheduled to leave Vienna for Paris -- something he could still do while talks continue -- before adding the late Friday meeting. 
With a Monday deadline for an accord just days away, Kerry has had three meetings with Zarif and Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief. 
The talks in Vienna also involve diplomats from Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia. 
We're very clear that we have to get more flexibility from the Iranians, he said. 
In return, we're prepared to show some flexibility on our side. 
NPR's Eyder Peralta, who wrote Monday about the current round of talks, provided some background to how the sides got to this point. 
He wrote: 
Business groups have long been active players in the nation's immigration debate. 
They represent employers who need to recruit workers, after all -- employers who are sometimes investigated, even prosecuted, for hiring workers who are not approved to work in the U.S. legally. 
Many big employers have been pushing for reforms that would allow them to keep more science and technology workers and skilled laborers in the country. 
But the executive action President Obama announced Thursday leaves out much of what the business lobby has been advocating for. 
Obama's announcement will allow more undocumented immigrants with U.S.-born children to apply for work permits, among other things. 
But the policies will not help businesses with their key immigration concerns, says Matt Sonnesyn, a senior director at the Business Roundtable, which represents large businesses. 
Last night's actions do help for those -LSB- workers -RSB- who are already here -- to have some security that they're going to remain and continue working, he says. 
But they don't really address how we're going to attract and retain those workers from around the world. 
He notes the president did extend a program giving high-skilled students the ability to work while applying for a visa. 
And there is some added flexibility for those who already have work visas to move between jobs. 
But Sonnesyn says the action does not increase the total number of visas available -- either to high - or low-skilled temporary workers. 
That is a big blow to business groups, especially as the U.S. economy recovers. 
Many big employers want to recruit more science and technology workers, as well as skilled laborers in fields like manufacturing and construction. 
But that's also not a surprise, Sonnesyn says. 
The president could only act on enforcement -- things like border control and deportation of criminals -- not on legislation. 
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was an economist in the George W. Bush administration and is now president of the policy analysis group American Action Forum, says he thinks the business groups are going to be, by and large, disappointed. 
There wasn't really much in there for them. 
That system, known as E-Verify, would reduce an employers' legal liability if they hire someone with falsified documents. 
E-Verify received no mention in Obama's address. 
Holtz-Eakin says what might be surprising, given the partisan rhetoric around immigration, is how little daylight there is between the president's policy position and that of most Republicans and the business community. 
There's much less division than people realize, Holtz-Eakin says. 
The president supports the immigration bill that passed the Senate more than a year ago. 
The business community also supports that legislation, but the Republican leadership in the House has not brought it up for a vote. 
There's no disagreement on the policy. 
The issue is 100 percent politics, Holtz-Eakin says. 
And the sad reality is, the president pushed the politics in the wrong direction last night. 
But he didn't. 
Instead, Litan says, Obama chose a high-stakes political gamble that could pay off, if Republicans in Congress take up the president's challenge and pass immigration legislation. 
And at the end of the day, he adds, whatever the president can do can only last for two years. 
The next president could decide to undo the whole thing. 
Holy mother of God, this has to be one of the craziest vehicle stunts I 've ever seen: The Formula 1 team Lotus got one of their giant trailer trucks to jump over one of their race cars running at full speed. 
It is absolutely insane. 
According to Raphael Orlove at TruckYeah! 
the stunt was coordinated by Mike Ryan -- an stuntman who worked on Terminator 2. 
He also drove the truck. 
I love crazy people. 
There was no protest, the report reads. 
The CIA only changed its initial assessment about a protest on September 24, 2012, when closed caption television footage became available on September 18, 2012 two days after Ambassador Susan Rice spoke, and after the FBI began publishing its interviews with U.S. officials on the ground on September 22, 2012. 
The report also cites a flawed process that was used to create talking points that the House panel had asked for so that its members could discuss the attacks publicly. 
It notes that the same talking points were used in Rice's public statements.

Guest columnist Marat Ryndin wrote a piece answering the question of why Google decided to split Inbox from Gmail. 
It can be easy to lie -- especially when you're trying to stay out of trouble or avoid confrontation -- but it can catch up with you. 
If you have trouble sticking to the truth, imagine each lie you tell as a charge on an imaginary truth credit card. 
Being in debt can be stressful, challenging, and lead you to bankruptcy, but debt comes in many different varieties. 
Todd Vernon at Inc. describes a debt that involves your honesty: 
This is Truth Debt. 
It's like financial debt. 
Sometimes it's alright to have a little financial debt to bridge short-term issues, but if not kept in check, the interest on this debt can become stifling. 
And when the debt gets called, the results can be disastrous. 
As much as we'd like to believe that honesty is the best policy, it's not necessarily ideal for every situation in the real world. 
Lies do build up, though, and when the creditors come calling, you may not be able to pay up. 
Think of each lie you tell as a charge on your credit card. 
A little bit here or there is okay, but eventually you need to pay it off, so keep it in check. 
Being honest and telling the truth is like paying in cash: even though it rarely comes with any convenient perks, cash is always king. 
Know when to pay with the right tender. 
As a Friday treat to her mortal fans, Beyonce released two of the songs off her upcoming deluxe version of last year's Beyonce, which is coming out November 24. 
Both songs are good, but I can't resist Beyonce when she raps so I'm favoring 7/11. 
Beyonce teamed up with Nicki Minaj for her Flawless remix and that brash, staccato style is present here. 
Nicki's not on this track but I hope they're best friends by now Nicki could also help Bey work on her verses. 
This song is fun but she's mostly just announcing her dance moves, which is good for amateur choreographers ... but not particularly imaginative. 
You might 've seen a mistletoe-toting drone sponsored by TGI Friday's pop up in your Facebook feed this week. 
This idea is both dumb and unoriginal. 
Some maker-types deployed a mistletoe drone in San Francisco last year. 
That was cute. 
This is a marketing stunt. 
The idea of flying a drone around a restaurant, however, isn't entirely terrible. 
So I came up with seven ideas for drone-driven restaurant experiences that are both more fun and more productive than some chain's attempt at viral marketing. 
In no particular order ... 
This is a no-brainer. 
Why fly mistletoe around -- before Thanksgiving! 
-- and make strangers kiss each other while they're trying to get down with some mozz sticks. 
Why not deliver more mozz sticks? 
It's basically the same concept except the restaurant would attach deliciously gooey rods of cheese to the drone instead of a fake plant that's possibly poisonous. 
This idea has actually been tested. 
It's been tested many times, in fact. 
Much like the mozzarella stick drone project, the restaurant would use the drone to deliver refreshing beers to thirsty customers. 
You could even string up a six-pack for maximum enjoyment. 
The kissing part of the evening will take care of itself. 
Now we're getting nice and creative. 
Last week, we saw a biodegradable drone made out of mushrooms that will decompose if it ever crashes and can't be found. 
This makes me think that it would be entirely possible to build a drone out of edible materials -- mushrooms or otherwise -- and the restaurant could just land on the damned table. 
BOOM: a moveable feast. 
Now we're getting really creative. 
If a robotic bartender can work on a cruise ship, there's no reason it can't handle happy hour at Friday's. 
While the beer drone would just delivery ready-made beers, this drone would actually mix cocktails -- somehow. 
It would probably take a little bit of clever programming and a lot of foam padding to protect the patrons. 
But the kids will love it. 
What's the worst thing about going to restaurants? 
Finding a parking spot when you're hungry. 
You know what this is not a problem in amazing era of drones. 
Let a drone do it for you. 
Just pull up to the curb, pocket your keys, and find your sustenance. 
A drone would lift the car up and carry it to an empty parking spot. 
It sounds implausible. 
But honestly, you build a drone with enough rotors, and it can pick up anything. 
What's the other worst thing about going to restaurants? 
Picking up paper towels by yourself. 
That's what bathroom attendants are for, but who goes to restaurants with bathroom attendants any more? 
Actually, this asshole does, and he gets them fired, too. 
No problem. 
A drone can do it. 
Due to the delicate nature of handing helpless humans towels, this job would require a very delicate drone. 
Luckily, very delicate drones are all the rage lately. 
Delivery drones became the original dumb drone marketing stunt nearly a year ago. 
There's a vague chance that delivery drones could become a reality, so it makes sense to do a test run on a scale that's smaller than a city. 
How about a restaurant ?! 
The check delivery's always awkward for everyone. 
Why not program a flying robot to do it instead ?! 
Saving shows that networks stupidly cancelled has been kind of a thing for the new wave of content creators, like Yahoo famously taking the reins of Community. 
Now a pre-emptively cancelled midseason replacement for NBC starring Ellie Kemper and created by Tina Fey has been scooped up by Netflix. 
The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt was created by Fey and her fellow 30 Rock alum Robert Carlock, and originally ordered by NBC, until the network changed its mind. 
Netflix has not only snapped up the original 13 episodes but asked for additional 13 episodes as well. 
And that's a very good thing because this definitely sounds like something we want to watch, according to the description by Deadline: 
After living in a cult for fifteen years, Kimmy decides to reclaim her life and start over in New York City. 
Armed with just a backpack, light-up sneakers, and a couple of way-past-due library books, she's ready to take on a world she didn't even think existed anymore. 
Wide-eyed but resilient, nothing is going to stand in her way. 
She quickly finds a new job working for 30 Rock's Jane Krakowski, a new roommate Tituss Burgess, 30 Rock, and a new beginning. 
It's like a 30 Rock reunion with a little Office thrown in. 
The series will be available in March.

Nobody makes a burger look better than pornburger master Matthew Ramsey. 
Each of his burgers are stunning works of art that you can almost taste and feel the savory meat juice just by looking at them. 
Here's a video he made with National Geographic that reveals how he makes his creations look so damn good. 
He takes a lot of time in crafting each one. 
The one in the video is one we 've featured here before. 
Winter is just beginning, and with it comes the winter blues, or worse, Seasonal Affective Disorder. 
The time to start prepping for those dark and gloomy cold-weather days is now. 
For most of us, the fall and winter months may mean a little gloominess and a cold-weather funk that we 'll just have to work a little harder to shake. 
For others though, that funk can balloon into Seasonal Affective Disorder SAD, which is much more serious. 
Regardless of how you experience the cold weather months, here are a few tips to help you stay energized and in good spirits. 
Blast from the past is a weekly feature at Lifehacker in which we revive old, but still relevant, posts for your reading and hacking pleasure. 
This week, with Winter starting to kick into high gear, we're preparing ourselves -- not just for the cold, but for the gloom. 
One of the first things anyone suffering from SAD should do is try to get more natural light. 
In some places that's not possible, especially when the long nights and short days of the deep winter months set in. 
In that case, consider switching some of the lights in your home or office with bulbs that simulate natural light. 
Depending on how severe your condition is, you may want to look into light therapy or phototherapy, where individuals sit in front of a lightbox on a daily basis to essentially immerse themselves in simulated sunlight. 
The Cleveland Clinic has a great description of how phototherapy works, and while a full-on lightbox may be too much for some people, it's barely enough for others. 
If you don't think replacing your light bulbs is required, try throwing open your windows during the day to let as much light in your home or office as possible, and keeping some of your lights on a little longer to keep your environment brighter, even if those bulbs don't simulate natural light. 
Sometimes a little goes a long way. 
Getting your tasks and projects in order and making an effort to stay organized can actually help relieve some of the down in the dumps hopelessness that comes from not only being depressed, but being depressed and staring at a mountain of work to do. 
By arranging your to-do list into something that's actually actionable, and by building your own productivity style that works for you, you remove can help relieve some of the crushing weight that a massive, unorganized to-do list can have. 
Admittedly, while getting organized doesn't actually relieve any of the symptoms of SAD, it can help you be more productive, have clear goals and tasks that you can tackle, and gives you a seamless way to make good use of your time without having to build up the energy to start a new task or project. 
If you can just slide from task to task, you're less likely to throw up your hands in despair and just curl up in bed until the spring thaw. 
Don't underestimate the benefits of exercise to help improve your mood and overall well being. 
Whether the winter months just make you feel a little down in the dumps or you find that the deeper into the winter it gets the less you want to move from the couch at all, getting physical and starting a workout regimen can go a long way towards making you feel better about yourself, your lifestyle, and the time of year. 
Even getting up and getting outside for a quick walk in the daylight can make a huge difference. 
Get out of the house. 
When we asked you a long time ago how you beat the winter blues, many of you pointed out that the secret-aside from being as active as possible and getting as much daylight as possible-is to surround yourself with friends and loved ones who won't let you shut yourself in the house all winter long. 
Find some friends that will get out in the daylight with you, work out with you, drag you out of the house for a while, or who 'll come over and keep you company. 
Keeping your friendships and social relationships strong will also help a lot, and keep you from wasting the winter away alone at home. 
While many of these tips are great for the type of person who suffers from the winter blues, knows it, and can take action now to get themselves prepared for it, if you're the type who sinks into a more serious seasonal depression, it's time to talk to a professional, now, before the winter sets in. 
Replacing all of the light bulbs in your home, getting a huge lightbox, and trying to work out on a regular basis may all not be enough to whisk away the winter blues. 
In these cases, it's best to get professional help. 
Gheen is president of one of the country's largest anti-illegal immigration PACs, Americans for Legal Immigration. 
Activists like him are angry about the president's unilateral action to extend deportation relief to parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents and thousands more young people. 
But make no mistake, their opposition is about a lot more than just procedure. 
Lynes was also in Murrieta, Calif., this past summer when buses carrying unaccompanied minors were turned away from a Border Patrol processing center. 
She supports the House Republicans who blocked a bipartisan immigration bill that passed the U.S. Senate in 2013. 
Illegal immigration long has been a lightning rod issue in the Southwest. 
But it's one that also tends to cut right across traditional party lines. 
Conservative-leaning farm groups are also among those disappointed by the president's action, but for far different reasons. 
Farmers did not get any special attention in the president's plan. 
They long have lobbied Congress for a guest worker program that would provide deportation relief to immigrants willing to work on farms for at least five years. 
The industry says it's facing a long-term labor crisis, especially in California and Arizona. 
The workforce is getting older, and tighter border security lately is deterring more migrant workers from coming north. 
Nassif doesn't think the president's unilateral action necessarily will change the dynamics in Congress, though. 
He's optimistic that an overhaul bill still will gain traction come January. 
But it's safe to say that optimism isn't as pervasive in cities like Los Angeles. 
In the immigrant-heavy neighborhoods around the markets and pop-up shops of Alvarado Street, life probably will go on unchanged for thousands of people living here without papers. 
Mora's mixed feelings stem from the fact that he got deportation relief the last time the president issued an executive action on immigration, in 2012, and was hoping his mother might be eligible this year. 
She brought him to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 11, he says, fleeing extreme poverty and domestic violence. 
Because Mora is not a citizen, though, his mother won't be eligible for relief under the president's plan. 
Which is, you know, something that is frustrating, he says, knowing that she was basically the person that saved my life, saved my siblings' life, and has sacrificed so much to give us a better opportunity. 
But Mora says the president's decision to act alone does send a clear message to Congress. 
The big question now is what lawmakers' next move will be. 
I'm a big fan of cutaway things, specially if they are real like this lock. 
It's fascinating to see how machines and mechanisms work, with the little pins and springs moving to fit the shape of the key, leaving the barrel free to move when everything clicks. 
Many things will make Monday night's NFL game between the Buffalo Bills and New York Jets an odd duck. 
Among them: It's being played in Michigan, and tickets to the game are being given away at no charge. 
The move comes despite the Bills' hopes that they could clear some 220,000 tons of snow from their home, Ralph Wilson Stadium. 
The team had offered to pay $ 10 an hour to anyone who would shovel snow at the venue. 
The NFL announced Thursday that it's moving the Bills-Jets game to the other end of Lake Erie, leaving many Bills fans with the prospect of a 270-mile drive to Detroit's stadium for what was scheduled as a home game. 
If you're wondering about the Jets' home, MetLife Stadium, it isn't available because they share it with the Giants, who 'll be playing there Sunday night. 
With Buffalo still digging out from snowdrifts that measured more than 7 feet in places, the Bills scrambled to get their players together to fly to Detroit Friday. 
For some, the commute to the airport involved riding on snowmobiles. 
The team also plowed the streets in a neighborhood where several players live. 
The Bills-Jets game won't kick off until Monday night, at 7 p.m. local time. 
But if you're thinking the weather could bring a double-feature edition of Monday Night Football, think again: The game will be televised only in the Buffalo and New York markets and via DirecTV. 
I finally got around to seeing Chef, the Jon Favreau film about a chef who SPOILER ALERT starts a food truck. 
Food trucks and Twitter go together like Korean BBQ and tacos but in this film the tweet-integration was ridiculously blatant -- really, to the point of distraction. 
So much so that when the film came out earlier this year, tons of people were asking: Did Twitter pay for all that promotion? 
Favreau said no, repeatedly, that he just wanted the film to be more realistic. 
But consider all these silly attempts at making social media feel more realistic: 
Just when you thought it couldn't get worse, his son gives him another totally random tutorial on another tech tool: Vine. 
Which is -- yep -- owned by Twitter. 
The rest of the movie might be good but I was too distracted by the tweeting birds to enjoy it. 
Watch it and let me know what you think.

This #FeministHackerBarbie by @doublehelix is my fave so far.

Packed with Over 50 Stickers! 
, it dreams up a computer engineering version of Barbie who seems better at taking praise for other people's work than doing any actual coding. 
It prompted some serious outrage on the net this week because Barbie the computer engineer says things like I'm only creating the design ideas and I 'll need Steven's and Brian's help to turn it into a game. 
She also infects her sister's computer, leans on these two guy friends to fix the problem, and then takes credit for their work. 
Bad Barbie! 
But the internet has fallen in love with Feminist Hacker Barbie. 
She's the brainchild of Kathleen Tuite, an independent computer programmer based near Santa Cruz, California, who spent a half-day this week putting together a website where people could re-caption the original book, hacking it to fix all of its pastel-hued problems. 
Tuite, who until recently was a Washington University graduate student studying crowdsourcing, says she created the site out of disappointment and frustration with the official Barbie book. 
In the past few days, her Feminist Hacker Barbie has blossomed into a full-blown and extremely funny internet meme with thousands of captions, many of which we think would make great fodder for a real Barbie engineering movie. 
These captions work so well because of the sheer ridiculousness of the original Barbie images. 
In one of them, Barbie inexplicably sits in front of three computers, her hand on two different machines simultaneously. 
About 2,700 of the caption were uploaded to Tuite's website -- and then someone discovered a bug in the Django code Tuite used to build the site. 
In short order, Feminist Hacker Barbie got hacked. 
At first, someone started uploading photos of Free Software Foundation advocate Richard Stallman. 
After that, came the porn. 
So Tuite pulled the plug on the uploads, but folks are free to create their own images and captions. 
And those have been popping up all over Twitter and Facebook for the past few days. 
I can close my eyes and just listen to the noises of all the work that goes into repairing shoes. 
The machines pressing down, the cutting of the sole, the sanding, the stitching, the brushing of the glue. 
It's a symphony of satisfying noises. 
It's the only soundtrack you need. 
The outbreak started back in August in a rural village, WHO said. 
Then it spread to seven of Madagascar's 22 regions. 
Two cases have occurred in the country's capital of Antananarivo. 
The plague is not new to Madagascar. 
The disease re-emerged in the country in the 1990s. 
And now Madagascar reports more cases than any other country -- about 300 to 600 each year. 
People catch the plague bacteria -- Yersinia pestis -- from fleas that live on rodents. 
So the disease thrives in cities with poor sanitation. 
After a coup d'etat in 2009, Antananarivo's health and sanitation systems collapsed, Aaron Ross wrote on the Pulitzer Center's website in January. 
Trash can go weeks, even months, without being collected and rats have become a common sight along the narrow alleyways that coil around the city's steep hillsides, Ross wrote. 
The plague's signature symptom is large, swollen lymph nodes. 
This form of the disease is called bubonic plague. 
And it's not very contagious. 
When the infection moves to the lungs, it's called pneumonic plague, a form that's more dangerous. 
It kills quickly, and it spreads from person to person through coughs. 
Want to make a giant 3D-printed spider robot? 
A humanoid help-mate? 
A robotic scorpion with a powerful, electrified tail? 
Makerclub can probably help. 
Created as a place for makers to come together and discuss 3D printed robotics, the service is now part commerce site, part repository, and part educational resource. 
Interestingly, the service is also offering a hardware brain on Indiegogo to help build the creations. 
Reilly has also created a board, called the MakerConnect, that makes it easy to build the creations on the site. 
Called the MakerConnect, it connects an Arduino board with on-board Bluetooth so you can wirelessly control the creations on the site. 
While you don't need to use the MakerConnect, the $ 50 board makes it much easier to build many of the robots on the site. 
We create 3D printed robotics projects which teach invention and product design. 
Each project is powered by our Arduino based chip, and controlled by your smartphone, said Rielly. 
Users can download plans and programs and then print all the parts needed for the robots. 
There are even lesson plans using the models so kids can learn how to create robotic projects with a minimum of fuss. 
I studied Electronic Engineering with Computing at Nottingham, with my 3rd year in UNSW, and then went into Software Development, said Rielly. 
I 've worked for a number of companies, big and small, including Experian, eBay and Brandwatch and have become a relatively proficient programmer. 
However, it always niggled me that I came out of University with a 2:1 and almost no real understanding of or passion for my subject, and I had to spend the next 5 years catching up before and after work. 
This all started from my frustrated efforts to make a remote controlled car 2 years ago. 
I could work out how to program everything but my woodwork and general craft skills are so below par, that everything I made would either fall apart or be so clunky that nothing would move. 
I was then lucky enough to meet up with my old boss at a Christmas party where we discussed the beginnings of my idea and get brought a 3D printer for my combined Christmas and Birthday Present two weeks later, he said. 
Reilly describes the project as everything I would have wanted as a 15-year-old kid. 
Throw in some Stephen King books and a Victoria's Secret catalog and I think he might be right. 
Motorcycles look cool. 
Movie stars look cool. 
So putting movie stars on motorcycles is almost always a badass cool combination on film. 
Watch Mojo put together a list ranking 10 of the most badass motorcycles in film history and the list includes some usual suspects: lightcycles, batpods and Harleys. 
Honorable mentions go to bikes from Akira, Planet Terror, Kill Bill and I Bought a Vampire Motorcycle. 
What else is missing? 
I don't know about you, but I love to see things cut in half. 
Sometimes they are boring, but most of the times they are incredible, like the mechanical calculator shown above. 
It's hard to believe this metal mess works. 
Here's more stuff that looks awesome stuff when cut in half. 
Have any favorite thing that shocked you when you saw it cut in half? 
Post it in the comments. 
There might not be anything more awesome than going to space. 
It's an incredible achievement and the idea of exploring the unknown is fascinating. 
But as this short animation called Solus by Zac Dixon for Identity Visuals shows, it can get quite lonely. 
Watch it, it's nearly as good as any feature. 
Also, the minimalist design of the animation works so well. 
The entire thing is so simple but so well done. 
Even without any dialogue, you understand what the mission of this lonely space ship is.

Dennis Ritchie is gone. 
And Bell Labs is no longer the force it once was. 
But you can still visit them on the net. 
In the classic video above, Ritchie is among those who pitch Bell Labs to potential recruits somewhere towards the tail end of its heyday, in the ’70s and on into the ’80s. 
It's a small window into an operation that changed the world. 
Bell Labs gave us the transistor, the basic building block for all modern computers. 
And later, Ritchie and his colleague Ken Thompson built the UNIX operating system and the C programming language, two things that provide the foundation for so much of the technology we use today, from the iPhone to massive web services like Google and Facebook. 
The video comes from the American telephone giant then known as Ma Bell, the monopoly that would eventually gave way to companies like Verizon, the modern AT&T, and Alcatel Lucent, which runs Bell Labs today. 
It's a far cry from the pitch engineers now get from the likes of Google and Facebook. 
But that's part of its charm. 
It doesn't promise perks like ping pong tables or kegorators -- those mainstays in the modern world of tech innovation. 
Instead, employees pitch more mature things like getting paid to complete a master's degree in engineering and raising kids in Columbus, Ohio, where Bell Labs had a satellite office. 
But the real pitch is the work itself. 
The work is exciting, Ritchie says, because the people are exciting. 
Yes, it feels like stock chatter. 
But history would prove him right, and today's tech companies might be able to learn a thing or two from the old Bell approach. 
That said, it wasn't all work and no play at Bell. 
The video also shows off a little outdoor bowling. 
Think of it as the ping pong of its day. 
There are a lot of characters in the Hunger Games franchise. 
They're actually fairly hard to keep track of. 
Those semi-confusing names don't help, either. 
Like, what exactly is a Plutarch Heavensbee? 
To help prepare you for today's release of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part 1, we'd like to offer a definitive ranking of each character and why they're important to Panem -- just so you can keep them straight. 
Value: In one move of self-sacrifice, Mags proved why she is the person we should all aspire to be. 
One bitchin' old lady. 
Value: Watching Snow drip pure evil charisma is one of the most fun parts of any Hunger Games. 
This heel is one heel we love to hate. 
Value: Rue may not have known it at the time, but her brief friendship with Katniss was a major catalyst for the Mockingjay's eventual rise. 
Indispensable. 
And so adorable. 
Value: These scenes, and everything they stand for. 
The Quarter Quell would have been a snooze without Mason to put a sting in them. 
Value: He may be a drunk bastard, but Haymitch keeps Peeta and Katniss above ground. 
His charmingly combative relationship also lightens the mood in really murdery situations. 
Value: President Snow might be the scariest person in Panem, but Caesar is the damn craziest. 
The Games would be a basic affair without his maniacal charm. 
Value: Just when we thought it was impossible to look away from Katniss, Finnick walked in and said with secrets -- then immediately became essential. 
He's by far the most compelling Games victor, and the torch he holds for Annie gives him so many bonus points. 
Value: If it was possible to win a Hunger Games based purely on fabulous, Cinna would be the infinity victor. 
Also, he lit the Girl On Fire. 
Value: Beetee is deceptively intelligent and cool as a cucumber under extreme duress. 
This is a guy you absolutely want on your side in a rotating wheel of death. 
Value: Thread hasn't gotten a whole lot of screen time, but when he shows up he's terrifying. 
The word Peace might be in his title, but this guy dishes out punishment like he'd do it for free. 
A bad guy worthy of employ by President Snow. 
Value: All she needed were these grieving tears to become an MVP. 
She cried. 
We cried. 
Then District 11 got on board with the revolution. 
Value: The highest-ranking double agent in the Capitol. 
Pretty crucial. 
Value: His motives may not have been as pure as Mags', but one act of mercy by Thresh kept Katniss alive in her first Hunger Games. 
Big ups to Thresh. 
Value: Much like Gale, Peeta should probably be higher on this list, but besides being sweet and all that he's also pretty boring. 
Because he keeps saving Katniss, though, he's not at the bottom. 
Value: Overall, this guy was kind of a dud. 
He's near the basement of this list because it's not like he got to keep his job, and spared the absolutely bottom because of that beard. 
Value: She may single-handedly bring down this entire franchise by being lifeless at every turn. 
You're the reason all this is happening, girlfriend. 
Show some spunk! 
Artur Stanisz takes perfect photos of landscapes. 
So perfect, in fact, that sometimes they seem unreal. 
Like this image of Mount Asgard, a strange double-peak on the Cumberland Peninsula of Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada. 
It feels like the actual home of the Nordic Gods. 
The rest of his photos are even more stunning. 
Artur Stanisz is a Polish-Canadian landscape photographer based in Vancouver. 
He also organizes workshops and adventure photo tours for aspiring landscape photographers who wish to explore with me the beauty of British Columbia, Canadian Rockies, Yukon or Patagonia Chile and Argentina as well as Bolivia, Peru and Poland. 
This is part of a series in which we are featuring futuristic, striking, and just beautiful photography.

According to exobiologists at NASA, these mysterious shrimps and its symbiotic bacterium may hold clues about what life could be like on other planetary bodies. 
It's life that may be similar -- at the basic level -- to what could be lurking in the oceans of Europa, deep under the icy crust of the Jupiter moon. 
For two-thirds of the Earth's history, life has existed only as microbial life. 
On Europa, the best chance for life would be microbial. 
-LSB- ... -RSB- The overall objective of our research is to see how much life or biomass can be supported by the chemical energy of the hot submarine springs. 
-LSB- ... -RSB- It's a remarkable symbiotic system. 
-LSB- The -RSB- hydrogen sulfide -LSB- produced by the vents -RSB- is toxic to organisms in high concentrations, but the bacteria feeding the shrimp need a certain amount of this chemical to survive. 
Nature has worked out a solution: The shrimp position themselves on the very border between normal, oxygenated ocean water and sulfide-rich water so that they and the bacteria can coexist in harmony.The temperatures at the vents can climb up to a scorching 750 degrees Fahrenheit 400 degrees Celsius, but waters just an inch away are cool enough to support the shrimp. 
The shrimp are blind, but have thermal receptors in the backs of their heads. 
That's the question of the hour. 
The Ebola virus has made taking your temperature part of everyday conversation. 
People in West Africa are doing it. 
People returning from the region are doing it. 
And so are the overly paranoid in the United States. 
For anyone who's been exposed to the virus, a body temperatures of 100.4 or higher has been deemed the point of concern. 
The goal, of course, is that magic number: 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Except 98.6 degrees isn't so magical after all. 
In fact, that might not be your normal temperature. 
When Ebola is not a factor, Levine defines 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit as a serious fever. 
Although he notes that you could register a lower temperature and still be harboring an infection. 
These high temperatures can actually save your life. 
If you have an infection or virus, your body's response is to raise your internal temperature to kill it off. 
In other words, fever is your body's defense against whatever is making you feel sick. 
So before you take fever reducers like Tylenol or aspirin, you may want to consider letting your body do its job, says Levine. 
Lowering the temperature with Tylenol doesn't help you fight infection, he says. 
It just masks it. 
But if the patient is shivering, shaking, sweating, you may want to lower -LSB- the temperature -RSB- for comfort reasons. 
Baseline normal temperatures differ from person to person and from day to day. 
But if you're worried about what your thermometer is telling you, here are some points of interest, from the low to the very, very high. 
56.7 degrees: Anna Bagenholm, a Swedish medical student, spent 80 minutes under ice after a skiing accident in Norway in 1999. 
When she was rescued, her body temperature was 56.7 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Although she was clinically dead, resuscitation efforts were successful and she now has only minor nerve damage. 
Do not try this at home. 
98.6 degrees: This is the generally accepted normal temperature, though different people can have different normals and even the same person's temperature can vary throughout the day and still be considered normal. 
Temperature is lower in the morning, since you're less active, and women tend to have slightly less than half a degree higher baseline temperatures than men. 
A 1992 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association measured the temperature of 148 adults four times a day for three consecutive days. 
The mean was 98.2 degrees. 
100.4 degrees: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified 100.4 as the benchmark for concern about Ebola. 
Depending on an individual's normal baseline and Ebola-related symptoms, a triple-digit temperature in the context of Ebola is cause for concern. 
107 degrees: Multiple organ failure can occur, and the high temperature itself might bring on seizures. 
But Adalja says hospitals in the U.S. wouldn't let it get to this point: you'd be treated with fever reducers and cooling blankets. 
115 degrees: On July 10, 1980, 52-year-old Willie Jones of Atlanta was admitted to the hospital with heatstroke and a temperature of 115 degrees Fahrenheit. 
He spent 24 days in the hospital and survived. 
Jones holds the Guinness Book of World Records honor for highest recorded body temperature. 
Winter is creeping down on northern Pakistan from the Himalayan Mountains. 
The skies are cloudless and bright blue. 
The air is as cool and refreshing as champagne. 
This is the season for swaddling yourself in a big woolen shawl. 
And it's also the season when Pakistanis try not to ... let the bustards get them down. 
I'm talking about the Houbara bustard. 
It's a bird, about half the size of a turkey, and with the same rotten luck this time of year. 
But others also fly here at the same time. 
They come by private jet and are very rich and often royal. 
They hail from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain. 
The Arabs began hunting bustards thousands of years ago and never stopped. 
Bustard meat is apparently thought to do wonders for the sex drive. 
The feathers of the bustard are dull brown, which would seem to be good camouflage if you're trying to hide in Pakistan's deserts and plains. 
But the Arab hunters use falcons with very sharp eyes and even sharper talons. 
To hunt the Houbara bustard in Pakistan, you need a government permit. 
The speices is listed as vulnerable and declining by international conservation organizations. 
But Pakistan is eager to get along with its rich Gulf neighbors. 
So every winter the government doles out hunting permits to Arab sheiks. 
And every winter there's an outcry from Pakistanis who want to save the likable bustard. 
It emerged that in January that a Saudi prince and his friends killed 2,100 bustards in three weeks. 
That's 2,000 more than the limit allowed by the government permit. 
Some Pakistani opposition politicians are now trying to stop their majesties. 
They 've filed a motion in parliament saying bustard hunting by Arab princes is compromising Pakistan's sovereignty. 
But this is a very long shot. 
Money from the Persian Gulf talks. 
Bustards don't. 
Look, the Internet is a big place, and it's not easy to keep up with everything that you should. 
We understand. 
But there's no longer any need to worry: We 've taken what you really need to have an opinion about in terms of Internet pop culture and pushed it all into one place for you. 
VH1's Bye, Felicia? 
Bill Cosby's problematic silence? 
Lenny Kravitz's Fly Away turned into a piece of disturbing genius? 
It's all here. 
Think of it as a short primer on what you might want to have an opinion on over the next couple of days. 
What Really Happened: Sick of those YouTube song uploads with lyrics? 
So is Neil Cicierega, which explains this terrifying moment of genius uploaded to YouTube with the appropriate caption this is my first video, hope you enjoy! 
:-RRB-. 
The Takeaway: Man. 
Anyone else really want a Milky Way now? 
What Really Happened: Hey, remember when the world collectively realized that Queer Eye for a Straight Guy was, you know, kind of objectifying and offensive when you stopped to think about it? 
The collective hive mind of television executives apparently doesn't, doubling down on the Maybe -LSB- the non-straight/white demographic of choice -RSB- can help us be better high concept with the announcement of a new show in which sassy black women help clueless white women sort out their lives. 
December's Bye, Felicia will, according to VH1's announcement, empower ... women who could use a dose of honesty in order to turn their lives around. 
The announcement earlier specifies that the two life coaches, Deborah Hawkes and Missy Young, will only be helping white girls across the Los Angeles area, just to make everything clear. 
For those wondering where the title comes from, there was a sort-of explanation on On Air with Ryan Seacrest recently. 
As that clip quasi-suggests, it actually comes from from a scene in Friday. 
On a related note, bae is Dutch for poop. 
The Takeaway: What's even more surprising about Bye Felicia is that it's the second such show around right now. 
For the first, let's turn to Lifestyle and the even-more-appallingly-titled Girlfriend Intervention, which launched back in August. 
All we need is one more show like this, and we have a trend. 
Oh, please please please can FOX announce something with Basic Bitch in the title? 
That's exactly what we need right now. 
What Happened: Bill Cosby tweets Go ahead. 
Meme me! 
It almost immediately backfires when people start tweeting images of the comedian referencing rape allegations against him. 
He eventually gets asked about it during a radio interview -- and falls silent. 
What Really Happened: Look, Bill Cosby doesn't want to talk about the allegations of sexual assault surrounding him again, even if it is following what may be the worst social media PR disaster in recent memory. 
Seriously, he literally will not talk about them at all, as NPR host Scott Simon found out last weekend. 
In fact, he doesn't want to talk about them so much that his lawyer even issued a statement to that effect. 
Of course, that hasn't stopped everyone else talking about them, with yet another woman stepping up to accuse the comedian of rape this week. 
By now, much of the conversation surrounding the story has turned to the responsibility or otherwise of both NBC and Netflix to rethink their in-progress projects with Cosby, with CNN, Forbes and Deadline amongst the outlets suggesting that something should be done. 
What Happened: A writer for Time suggests banning the word feminist. 
Feminists, rightfully, don't take too kindly to that suggestion. 
What Really Happened: Poor Katy Steinmetz. 
After spending almost a week dealing with the pushback from her tone-deaf at the very least suggestion that feminist was a word that we should consider banning -- let's stick to the issues and quit throwing this label around like ticker tape at a Susan B. Anthony parade, she argued -- Steinmetz ended up being thrown under a bus when Time editor Nancy Gibbs apologized for the inclusion of the word in the poll last weekend. 
The word ` feminist' should not have been included in a list of words to ban, Gibbs wrote. 
We regret that its inclusion has become a distraction from the important debate over equality and justice. 
In addition, the outlet also ran an op-ed from Robin Morgan defending the term. 
The Takeaway: This is what happens when your poll gets hijacked by online trolls, apparently. 
Although there are many other reasons to be concerned about the poll, even if you overlook the inclusion of feminist. 
Maybe Time should think about banning its banned word poll next year, just to be safe. 
What Happened: Previously unseen footage purporting to be a collaboration between Hostel director Eli Roth, Marilyn Manson and Lana del Rey leaked online, showing del Rey being sexually abused by Roth. 
Representatives for Manson quickly issued a statement distancing the singer from the footage. 
What Really Happened: The video, which Roth said in a 2013 interview was so sick, the footage has been locked in a vault for over a year, appeared online mid-week as part of a reel for LA-based art collective Strumgruppe. 
In part of the footage, Roth pushes del Rey's head into a pillow during a simulated sex scene, attempting to muffle her screams ; elsewhere, another woman covered in blood has her head pushed underwater. 
Following outcry over the release of the video, Marilyn Manson's management issued a statement saying that the singer did not direct this, shoot it, nor was it for a Marilyn Manson video or outtake footage made by him or to be used by him with his music. 
Instead, it was suggested that the footage was a fan video splicing up old Manson video footage with someone else's Lana Del Rey footage. 
The video was removed from YouTube, with the site citing a copyright claim by -LSB- Merlin -RSB- Essential Music as the reason why. 
The Takeaway: With both Roth and del Rey silent on the online debut of the footage as of writing, it's unclear what to make of this story. 
Both Manson's denial of connection with the footage and Roth's 2013 commentary suggest that they were aware of how transgressive it was, and that it arguably went too far in the name of shock value to be released. 
With the footage now removed from YouTube, it's likely that this will become part of the urban myths surrounding all three participants and their willingness to push boundaries, even if -- as in this case -- they might have pushed too far. 
What Really Happened: As Serial, the long form spin-off of This American Life, continues, we 've reached the inevitable point where the backlash is underway. 
Sure, you might be enjoying Sarah Koenig's reporting on the investigation of the 1999 murder of Have Min Lee, but have you considered her white privilege? 
Maybe that's impacting Koenig's understanding of the social world of both Adnan and Hae in the first place. 
Maybe you're just enjoying the show too much, especially considering its translation of real world tragedy into weekly unfolding narrative. 
Hell, you might even be someone who is trawling through a grieving family's pain as a form of entertainment. 
The Takeaway: Judging by the speed at which the backlash arrived -- Serial is, after all, only eight weeks old -- we can expect the backlash to the backlash any minute now. 
In addition to interest from Hollywood in terms of a future adaptation, it's become the fastest podcast to reach five million streams and downloads through iTunes, so clearly someone is still enjoying it. 
Well, besides Mail Chimp, of course. 
Let's wait and see how upset the Internet gets now that the show's regular Thursday updates are about to be disrupted by Thanksgiving and we 'll find out how many people really care. 
What Happened: A band got stuck in some snow. 
I mean, really stuck. 
What Really Happened: In what sounds like a terrible movie waiting to happen, the band Interpol found themselves trapped aboard their tour bus for almost 50 hours this week, when a snowstorm stranded them on the road as they tried to leave Buffalo, New York. 
Thankfully, they had food, drink and social media to entertain them during this time: 
Brandon took this snap of our scenery. 
Sheeeeeeeiiiiiit.-DK pic.twitter.com/X6AjoKe4gT 
Hour 13 trapped in the snow. 
Dry goods and vodka. 
We will make it. 
- DK pic.twitter.com/bEQhaUokKi 
Still trapped yo! 
Haven't really moved in 30 hours and we 've been on the bus for nearly 40 hours. 
Nutso. 
Never seen anything like it.-DK 
Settling in for another night. 
Haven't moved all day. 
Hoping the expected storm tonight ain't as bad as predicted. 
C'mon now now.-DK 
Finally just started making a move. 
50 + hours later. 
Hoping for some luck today.-DK pic.twitter.com/2cpeu1lxQn 
So ... Paul is all like British people don't like peanut butter and I'm like, not true. 
Public opinion ?! 
Peanut butter is awesome.-DK. 
Truth. 
The Takeaway: No matter how comfortable and well-stocked that tour bus was, there's no way that two full days of house arrest bus arrest? 
could have been fun. 
In fact, this could be the kind of thing that will either cement the band's commitment to each other or tear them apart forever. 
Obviously, everyone is pulling for the former ; if nothing else, imagine the concept album about the experience they could come up with. 
What Happened: Daniel Handler tried to make a joke about author Jacqueline Woodson at the National Book Awards. 
Let's just say that he failed. 
What Really Happened: Handler better known as Lemony Snicket, the writer behind the A Series of Unfortunate Events books was the host of the 2014 National Book Awards this year, and during the ceremony, he presented Jacqueline Woodson with the Young People's Literature Award for her book Brown Girl Dreaming. 
After she accepted the award, Handler told the audience, I told Jackie she was going to win, and I said that if she won, I would tell all of you something I learned about her this summer, which is that Jackie Woodson is allergic to watermelon. 
Just let that sink in your mind. 
Yes, Daniel, we're letting the fact that you just made a this black woman is allergic to watermelon, isn't that insane joke in 2014 A.D. into our minds. 
But wait, you're saying. 
Maybe he didn't mean it in a racist way! 
Maybe there's some other, entirely inexplicable reason he finds that anecdote worth sharing! 
Yes, that would explain why he followed it up by saying I'm only writing a book about a black girl who's allergic to watermelon if I get a blurb from you, Cornell West, Toni Morrison, and Barack Obama saying ` This guy's OK. 
This guy's fine. 
''' 
Understandably, condemnation of Handler's comments was quick in arriving, over social media and in pieces from Gawker, The Huffington Post and The Washington Post amongst many others. 
The day after the ceremony, Handler took to Twitter to apologize, writing that his job was to shine a light on tremendous writers, including Jacqueline Woodson, and not to overshadow their achievements with my own ill-conceived attempts at humor. 
I clearly failed, and I'm sorry. 
The Takeaway: Let's ignore the obvious Don't be a racist ass lesson we can all learn from this for a moment -- I know, I know, it's hard ; I'm as stunned that he actually thought that joke was anything other than the worst idea at the time as you are -- because that, surely, should be taken as read. 
What 'll be interesting to see what happens now that he's apologized, and to see everyone's reaction to that particular apology, which feels very much of the I'm sorry you're mad school of thought as opposed to, you know, a genuine apology. 
But, yes: Don't be a racist ass is the real takeaway here. 
In 2012, George Lucas sold his company Lucasfilm to Disney for the staggering sum of $ 4 billion. 
Even more staggering is the $ 37 billion that Star Wars has raked in over the past 40 years. 
The Star Wars universe now comprises a vast array of products, from movies and TV shows to videogames and toys. 
But it all started with one movie, Star Wars later Star Wars: Episode IV -- A New Hope, whose modest $ 11 million budget was less than the average studio comedy at the time. 
The film's brash, upstart quality is part of its appeal. 
Those toys played a major role in the film's success, and helped bankroll its sequel, The Empire Strikes Back. 
But as with Star Wars itself, no one expected the toys to be popular. 
The demand caught fledgling toymaker Kenner completely off guard, and they resorted to selling empty boxes stuffed with promissory notes in lieu of actual Christmas merchandise. 
Even Lucas himself had no inkling about the public demand for Star Wars. 
He didn't even imagine action figures would be a big thing, says Chris Taylor, author of the new book How Star Wars Conquered the Universe. 
All he saw when he was first thinking about products that might emerge from Star Wars was an R2-D2 cookie jar. 
Taylor's book explores many of the financial concerns that shaped Star Wars, as well as some of the strategies that helped it succeed. 
It wasn't all smooth sailing. 
After the Emperor was vanquished in Return of the Jedi, toy sales fell dramatically. 
The story seemed over. 
As a boy Taylor resorted to imagining that the Emperor had been cloned, a plot twist that Lucas might have used to boost sales. 
The eventual success of Timothy Zahn's novel Heir to the Empire proved that there was still an audience for Star Wars, which helped motivate Lucas to release the special editions. 
Though controversial among fans, the special editions did help fund the prequel trilogy, which in turn grew the Star Wars brand into a multibillion-dollar franchise which seems set to continue indefinitely. 
He was a smart businessman, George Lucas, says Stillman. 
He really knew what he was doing. 
The thing about movies, you didn't license with them because they were there and gone pretty quickly. 
They didn't last very long, and unlike a TV show, which gives you an advertisement for that toy every week, every time it airs, once the movie's gone there's nothing in theory to compel you to go buy the toys. 
So Kenner approached the whole thing with easy-to-produce, inexpensive-to-produce objects like games, paper products, things that were cheap. 
And when they saw how successful Star Wars was, pretty quickly they realized they had to have toys. 
Well, at the time it took about a year to get a toy onto the stands. 
They realized they'd never make it in time for Christmas. 
Star Wars came out in May, it's only a few months away, so what they did was -- it's kind of the brilliance of a guy named Ed Schifman, who pitched this idea to Kenner and to the president Bernie Loomis -- which was, what if we release a ` redemption kit'? 
Essentially an empty box. 
It was called the Early Bird Certificate Package, and you got an empty cardboard envelope, and in it was a little certificate you could mail away, and then Kenner would send you the figures when they were ready, which turned out to be around February or March. 
So for Christmas you'd run downstairs, tear open the wrapping paper, and you'd get a piece of cardboard. 
There were definitely a lot of points during Empire Strikes Back when Lucas was basically running out of money, because he'd put up the collateral himself. 
It was all his winnings from Star Wars, and he was just basically doubling down by doing Empire Strikes Back. 
And there was a loan with Bank of America, but that loan was suspended when Lucasfilm payroll hit a million dollars a week. 
That just triggered some automatic stop on some new manager's bureaucratic system, and so there were a lot of times when they desperately needed an influx of new cash. 
I believe the Christmas of ’78 was the crucial season where they made way more money than they expected out of the -LSB- action -RSB- figures. 
... So it's kind of poetic that all of these kids in Christmas of ’78 acting out the further adventures of Luke Skywalker actually almost literally funded the future adventures of Luke Skywalker. 
-LSB- Lucas -RSB- very much treated The Empire Strikes Back as an ongoing business concern. 
You have to have insurance if Mark Hamill, god forbid, has another car crash, what are we going to do? 
Well, let's drop in a mention of Luke's sister -- who was not Leia at this point -- being across the galaxy, and that sort of became Yoda talking about the ` other.' 
That was what it referred to. 
Lando was the insurance against Han Solo. 
And you start to introduce the Emperor with the idea that he would become the main villain, and Vader would just be killed off in the next film, and you sort of start to focus on the big bad boss. 
Because Lucas still didn't get that Vader was as big a deal as he was -- this of course is before he came up with the ` I am your father' revelation. 
So yeah, it really is a case of a businessman buying insurance. 
I thought that was a genius move on the part of Kathleen Kennedy and J.J. Abrams to use the R2 Builders Club, which if folks don't know, it's this club of about seven or eight thousand people around the planet, who are all endeavoring to create a screen-accurate, functional R2-D2. 
And I 've seen a number of their R2-D2s, and they are just gorgeous, and everyone flocks to them. 
They go to Maker Faire events, and people just love it, but it does take a long time to do. 
Then again, 7,000 people, that's a very powerful fanbase to have on your side. 
They're better constructed than the ILM versions, and they don't go racing off and crashing into walls and losing their domes, as they used to, but also simultaneously it's a way to ingratiate yourself with fandom. 
So absolutely a genius business move, and I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of that. 
A grand jury decision on whether Officer Darren Wilson will face charges for killing Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. may be near.

It was very hard for women to get an education, when she was growing up, the 94-year-old Obama says. 
Only young boys or men were allowed to go to school. 
But things are different in Kenya now, she says. 
United Nations data actually shows a higher percentage of Kenyan girls going to school than Kenyan boys. 
I encourage them -- even the ones who have had families at a young age -- I encourage them to go to school so that the cycle of poverty can end, Obama says.

I help the orphans and widows, especially the young girls who have been orphaned by their parents dying of HIV, she says. 
I am their sole parent right now, so I help them pay school fees and also get them the things that they need, like sanitary towels, books, necessities like a pencil, school uniforms. 
That's what I do. 
There's so many kids that I 've helped educate, some of them at Nairobi University, Moi University and also Bondo University, she says. 
These are orphans who I 've helped pay for their school fares, and now it's my joy to see them in the universities about to graduate. 
There's a lot of success stories, and it just makes me happy and it keeps me going.

But it is illegal to take ginseng from national parks, where authorities are working to thwart poachers. 
Ginseng is short -- about shin height and has little red seeds, like tiny cranberries. 
Corbin, who spots some growing deep in the park, crouches down and digs his finger into the soil near the root, then pulls a spray can and a little jar of thick yellow powder out of his pocket. 
The powder is Corbin's anti-poaching technology. 
If someone digs up the root he's marked and tries to sell it, it 'll glow under a black light, revealing that it was poached. 
Park officials say Corbin's dye has helped convict 41 ginseng poachers in the last four years. 
One was Billy Joe Hurley. 
He pleaded guilty to his fourth poaching conviction earlier this fall and is serving five and a half months in federal prison. 
Hurley's lawyer, Corey Atkins, is sympathetic to his client and other locals who do the same thing. 
They're not out there robbing little old ladies. 
They're just trying to make a living doing something that they're really good at, Atkins says. 
In fact, traditional diggers aren't the problem. 
Over the last couple of years, a new kind of digger has arrived on the scene, says Roddy Gabel with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
There's even a reality TV show about the medicinal root and those who dig for it. 
This newer craze you see sensationalized on television and stuff with people running out to make quick money digging ginseng -- those sort of Johnny-come-lately diggers are not steeped in the tradition of the older ginseng diggers who have these good practices that their father or grandfather or whoever taught them. 
And that's the concern we have. 
I paid almost up to $ 225 -LSB- per pound for fresh wild ginseng roots -RSB-, says Robert Eidus. 
He's one of 50 registered ginseng dealers in North Carolina. 
He's the middle man between diggers and bigger dealers who export the roots to Hong Kong. 
I'm selling the ginseng in bulk at $ 2,000 a pound. 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife numbers show a big jump in exports of wild ginseng between 2012 and 2013. 
Exports were up nearly 40 percent. 
Prices were more than $ 2,000 a kilo. 
That's what Corbin is up against, but he says it's worth the effort to protect biodiversity here. 
Well, you have to say that any time you remove any organism from a biome, you basically damage that biome, and yeah, I think it's worth it, he says. 
Hoping to broker a deal to ease years of disputes over Iran's nuclear program, Secretary of State John Kerry and other diplomats are locked in negotiations in Vienna. 
They have until Monday to reach a permanent deal. 
The talks stem from an interim agreement between Iran and six leading world powers -- the U.S., Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia -- that called for Iran to halt production of enriched uranium, in addition to other concessions. 
In return, the U.S. and other nations agreed to free billions of dollars in oil proceeds that had been frozen in foreign accounts, along with other financial considerations. 
That interim deal was reached in the wee hours of Nov. 24, 2013 -- and it resulted in a one-year deadline for reaching a permanent agreement. 
The deadline is Monday ; the White House reportedly told Democrats in Congress Friday that it might seek an extension if this weekend's talks fail to bring a new deal. 
More diplomats are joining the discussions this weekend, as officials from Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain spoke with Kerry on a conference call. 
In addition, Germany is sending its foreign minister to Vienna. 
The State Department says Germany's top diplomat, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, will meet here with Kerry. 
Steinmeier is also due to meet with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. 
Friday's talks were marked by a certain amount of brinksmanship, with both Zarif and Kerry making and then canceling plans leave Vienna. 
Kerry says any deal must shut off all of Iran's possible pathways to a nuclear weapon, while Iran says its rights to a peaceful nuclear program must be respected and economic sanctions must be lifted, not suspended. 
There has been speculation about new eleventh-hour proposals, but Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov says all the elements of a deal are already in place, and the job now is to assemble an acceptable package. 
The talks with Iran -- and the possibility that they might bring an easing of U.S. sanctions against the country -- prompted Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois to issue tweets in Persian Friday. 
The tweets referred to a statement on the talks and to a letter written to President Obama in both English and Persian. 
When it comes to smartphones, Easter eggs normally mean a hidden drawer of emoji, or maybe the ability to make the voice control sing you a song. 
But in the case of the Nexus 6, it means that there's a hidden LED notification light, fully functioning, but deactivated and hidden from view by Motorola. 
The light was found by XDA developer JMUT, who wrote his findings up on Reddit. 
Activating the light isn't the simplest process -- it requires you to root your phone -- but once you 've rooted, JMUT found that the Lightflow application will let you control the brightness and color of the LED. 
This is obviously good news if you're a Nexus 6 owner who's been missing an obnoxiously-blinking light in your life. 
But it's also a little bizarre -- why would Motorola bother including the LED in the phone, but then deactivate it and not bother mentioning the feature to anyone? 
Conspirary theorists, over to you.

Here's a positive story about tech companies and their awareness of the outside world, just in case this week had you disillusioned. 
Evernote today issued a fix for its Penultimate digital handwriting app for the iPad that it hopes will end more than a week of frustration for its users. 
Evernote bought the service, which lets you create notes and designs as if you are using paper, more than two years ago, but a major upgrade issued just over a week ago caused a series of issues for users. 
Changes to Penultimate 6.0 ′ s feature set -- including a new zoom mode, the merging of all notebooks, navigation difficulties and more -- drew a large number of complaints. 
We're sorry. 
We screwed up. 
We 've heard your feedback, and are going to make things better, Evernote wrote in response six days after update 6.0 landed. 
The company admitted that it released the new version too soon. 
It promised a swift update two days ago, and that landed today. 
Evernote said the new version of the app adds the top features and enhancements that have been requested over the past week. 
The company got a lot of criticism following the initial 6.0 update, but it seems that many customers appreciate how it responded. 
It's not all love -- and no doubt some users have been lost from the saga -- but when mistakes happen honesty is the best policy. 
Of course, Evernote does have past experience here. 
With the holidays coming up, many of us are meeting relatives from our extended family. 
When they explain how they're related, some of the terms are confusing. 
This chart gives you an easy guide. 
Flowing Data puts it all together. 
They explain how the chart works: 
Figure out the common ancestor between two relatives. 
Then select the relationship of the first relative to the common ancestor in the top row. 
Move down to the row that corresponds to the relationship of the second person to the common ancestor. 
The result is the relationship of the second person to the first.

The somewhat unlikely fact that people who pirate movies are also more likely to spend money on movies has been well-known for a few years now. 
But thanks to a survey conducted by BitTorrent, we can now put a number on just how generous the pirates are. 
In September, BitTorrent managed to get 2,500 of its users away from their bootleg Taylor Swift parties long enough to complete a survey about their content-buying habits. 
The results are a little awkward for the vehemently anti-pirate movie industry: BitTorrent users are 170 percent more likely than your average consumer to have paid for digital music in the last month, and over half had paid for a movie in the previous month. 
Most surprisingly, torrent users still buy physical copies of music -- nearly half had bought a CD in the past year, and one in ten still buy vinyl copies of records. 
Overall, the survey which, obviosuly, should still be taken with a fist-sized pinch of salt paints a very favourable picture for BitTorrent: its users are among the most profitable for the very movie and music businesses that are trying so hard to get torrents shut down. 
Really, though, all it proves yet again is that the current model for buying music is broken. 
Whatever the solution is -- whether it's shaped like Spotify, iTunes, or BitTorrent's own paid-for Bundles -- it can't come soon enough.

Can Iran and six world powers reach a historic deal over Iran's nuclear program by Monday? 
The negotiations are at a crucial phase. 
As the deadline nears, regional hopes and fears are rising in equal measure. 
A successful nuclear deal to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions could finally defuse one of the most dangerous crises in the Middle East. 
But a deal could also lead to more instability as regional powers react to what would be a historic re-set in relations in the Middle East. 
This is monumental. 
It opens up the door, says Iranian novelist Amir Cheheltan. 
He's on a book tour in New York, where his critically acclaimed fiction has more fans than in Tehran. 
Iranian authorities have censored most of his work. 
His novels, short stories and movie scripts describe everyday life in the Islamic Republic. 
His ninth novel, Tehran, Revolution Street, centers on power and corruption in post-revolution Iran. 
We have always had this struggle between modernity and tradition, he explains. 
The villages are the homeland of religious conservatism, and the cities are the homeland of the middle class. 
He has witnessed the damage to the middle class from crippling international economic sanctions. 
He believes a nuclear deal, with the lifting of sanctions, can unleash Iran's dynamic educated middle class. 
Eghtedari lived in Portland, Oregon, for decades and recently relocated to the United Arab Emirates for a job in engineering. 
His new home is less than an hour's flight from Tehran ; close enough to easily pick up Iranian media broadcasts. 
The details of the negotiations remain secret. 
Iran and the P5 +1 the members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany began meetings in Vienna earlier this week aimed at meeting Monday's deadline. 
Officials involved in the negotiations insist a comprehensive agreement is possible as they race against the diplomatic clock. 
But prospects of a deal have only increased anxiety in Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional rival. 
The two nations stand on opposite sides in regional conflicts from Syria to Bahrain and Yemen. 
The Saudis see an Iran that is dominant in Lebanon and Iraq and forcefully propping up a long-time ally, President Bashar Assad, in Syria. 
In the Saudi view, a successful nuclear deal would give the Iranians another step up the ladder to regional dominance. 
Many are worried, explains Khashoggi, because they believe it a choice between them or us. 
The Americans can only take one wife, he says, describing alliances in the region. 
But he believes this thinking is wrong. 
We Saudis need to look differently. 
The Iran of the 1980s is disappearing. 
Saudis don't see Iran's huge transformation. 
he adds. 
They don't want to believe there is a strong middle class. 
The Obama administration continues to reassure Saudi Arabia that the U.S. is committed to Saudi security. 
But a deal with Iran could undermine Saudi and Gulf state support for the U.S. led-coalition against the Sunni radicals of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. 
A nuclear deal further complicated the task of holding the anti-Islamic State coalition together in Syria, says Brian Katulis with the Center for American Progress. 
The Sunni powers deeply distrust Iran, a nuclear deal doesn't wash any of that distrust away. 
Inside Syria, activists are also closely watching the outcome of the Iranian negotiations. 
They see a win for Iran is a loss for them. 
Obviously, for us, Iran is an enemy just like Assad, says activist Raed Fares, who heads the media office in Kafranbel, a rebel-controlled town in northern Syria. 
The struggles of the Syrian people will last longer if the sanctions are lifted and Iran can freely send cash and military advisers to support the Syrian regime. 
The Obama administration has made the success of the nuclear talks a priority, a chance to reset relations in the region. 
Success or failure will have a significant impact. 
My sense is that Iran is on the verge of a major transformation, says Mohsen Milani, after a recent trip to Tehran. 
Milani is the executive director of the Center for Strategic and Diplomatic Studies at the University of South Florida. 
We are at the beginning of a new generation. 
You talk to ordinary people and you see a very dynamic and mature society, he says, more interested in the stock market than the mosque. 
Recently Gartner released its top 10 strategic technology trends for 2015 citing the impact of the digital business shift as a driving force behind these trends. 
With that, the number of CDO jobs has doubled since 2013 and continues to grow. 
The rise of the CDO comes at a time of much industry debate regarding the divide between business and IT. 
Amid the disconnect between CMOs and CIOs, the CDO finally promises some relief and reconciliation: CDOs understand the digital opportunities -- as well as the threats of cutting corners in the interest of time-to-market -- and have a solid grasp on both the technology choices and corresponding trade-offs before them. 
Where the CMO may be preoccupied revamping the company's brand by pursuing a viral mobile app, IT may still be struggling with bring-your-own-device BYOD. 
The CDO, meanwhile, can think holistically about how a company's strategy is executed across all digital channels -- such as mobile, the Internet of Things IoT and an increasingly important SaaS-based web -- and can provide insight and recommendations on how to reconcile the digital experience for key target audiences. 
Think of the last time you were at a conference or big event, for example ... wouldn't it be refreshing if there was a consistent, continuous experience as an attendee? 
Yet surprisingly, it is still all too common to have a registration experience that seems completely disconnected from the on-site experience. 
If there is a mobile app, it typically doesn't sync up with any pre-event outreach nor the post-event follow-up and is barely relevant to actual on-site behavior and preferences. 
Despite, or perhaps because of all the different avenues through which event organizers collect and disseminate information, personalization ends up falling short, resulting in a lack of engagement. 
The tide is beginning to turn, however. 
To stick with our example, more and more event teams are replacing cookie-cutter apps and siloed systems, fundamentally rethinking the way an attendee experiences a conference. 
Done right, a seamless digital experience extends beyond the conference for a continued dialog with attendees on topics relevant to them, long after they have returned to their daily lives. 
Great CDOs are masters of facilitating this in a non-intrusive manner. 
It takes vision, discipline and a thorough understanding of a broad set of technologies to effect digital change. 
In my experience, technology is rarely the main issue. 
Rather, it's about finding the organizational that allows a business to be successful defining and implementing its digital strategy. 
In most companies, such a will doesn't come without formal ownership. 
A true CDO owns and drives digital strategy across the entire organization and helps it extract value for the business. 
Anecdotally, this is where startups and smaller companies have an edge, because they typically have fewer traditional and fewer intuitive boundaries. 
From a technology perspective, CDOs spend a lot of time dealing with the continued impact of the mobile revolution. 
However, they also realize that companies need to start thinking about every aspect of their business and its digital impact, from mobile application development to managing distribution channels for content via new digital technologies. 
How do you engage potential customers and provide a consistent experience across a mind-boggling number of devices, each with their own unique capabilities and restrictions? 
How do you effectively manage content across channels, especially when they are supported by widely varying technology stacks? 
And with IoT expected to gain traction over the next 12 months, CDOs have to formulate a plan to embrace the next wave of digital innovation. 
Here, too, many startups have the advantage of being born digital and having embraced the latest digital technology to build its internal IT systems. 
Many startups we work with run entirely on cloud services such as Google Docs, Zoho and Expensify and inherently treat mobile and web channels as equally important. 
Thinking digital is in their DNA, which leads to an intuitive understanding of digital technology across every member of the team. 
LinkedIn already lists some 1,300 CDOs today, but many more digital operating executives lurk right beneath the SEO surface, especially in larger corporations, with titles such as Chief Media Officer, Head of Digital Strategy, VP Digital Marketing or simply VP Digital. 
Look for many of these to be updating and upgrading their profiles over the next year. 
Just as the CDO role is going mainstream, peer-led events such as the upcoming Chief Digital Officer Global Forum are testaments to a growing community of like-minded professionals. 
They're also a great place to mingle with, exchange best practices and, yes, scout for CDO talent. 
Yearly checkups and other things we should do regularly -- but not necessarily that often -- can easily be forgotten over the other 364 days' full of events. 
Put these ten sites or types of sites on your calendar for your yearly visit, though, and you can save money, make sure your information is secure, and otherwise check if you're on track. 
By law, everyone in the US is entitled to a free credit report once a year from each of the three credit bureaus at annualcreditreport.com make sure you don't go to similar-sounding sites, but only this official site. 
You can grab all three at once or spread out your requests so that every four months you can check your report for errors. 
More than 25% of people have potentially damaging errors on their credit reports, so make this at least an annual habit. 
This is like spring cleaning for popular online accounts. 
Every so often, you should check the security and permissions setting you 've given accounts like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and so on -- as well as the third-party services that connect to them. 
Previously mentioned MyPermissions and Notification Control are launching pads to these site's settings pages, making it easy to do a yearly audit. 
Even if you have a professional do your taxes, you might want to give IRS.gov a yearly visit to check how much you're withholding and make sure you're paying just enough in taxes. 
Huge refunds sound great -- except when you consider you could have had that money earning interest in your bank account throughout the year. 
It's probably easiest to remember to do this when you get your tax refund or bill. 
Open enrollment season -- when you can set up a flexible spending account and make changes to your health insurance plan -- only rolls around at a certain time of the year, which is right now, late fall/early winter. 
If your employer offers more than one plan, you 'll want to check your options every year even if you're happy with your current plan, just to make sure you have the best and most affordable coverage to date. 
Similarly, if your employer offers an FSA and you want to participate in it for healthcare or dependent care tax breaks, you have to enroll every year. 
You 'll get a notice from your HR department about your eligibility, but might want to mark the deadlines on your calendar just to make sure you don't miss them. 
If you're saving for your kids' college education with a state-run, tax-advantaged 529 plan or, frankly, any other kind of investment, you 'll want to make sure each year your investment is on track. 
Some plans offer age-adjusted investments like lifecycle funds for retirement, but adjusted for college goals for your kids, which balance automatically, but if yours doesn't or you have a more hands-on approach to investing for college, make sure you're reviewing your investment plan at least once a year. 
Likewise, at least once a year -- maybe the same time you're reviewing your taxes -- check to make sure you're still on track for your retirement plan. 
Compare how much you should be saving with how much you 've actually saved and make sure you have a diversified portfolio with the right asset allocation. 
Even if you have a lifecycle fund that automatically adjusts the investment allocation for you, it's a good idea to check up on your retirement account at least yearly. 
This one's for the homeowners: Once a year there's a special season when you can put more money in your bank account no, it's not home selling season. 
It's the timeframe in which you can appeal your property taxes, the second biggest expense for homeowners. 
In some areas, there may be a risk to filing an appeal, but if your town won't potentially raise taxes if you challenge the tax assessment, the money you can save might be worth fighting for. 
Check your town notices for when you can appeal your property taxes. 
The Social Security Administration is keeping tabs on how much money has been taken from your paycheck or contributed by you, if self-employed to calculate your total benefits should you file for them whether because you're retiring or get disabled. 
Even if you're naturally a trusting person, mistakes do happen. 
A visit to your Social Security statement at the official Social Security website every year to compare how much your W2 or tax return says you're paying to Social Security and how much they say you have is quick and painless. 
It could give you peace of mind that you 'll get the benefits you 've earned. 
Easiest to do this each year when you get your W2 and are doing your taxes. 
Some car insurance companies offer more discounts than others ; some are holding back on lower rates you could have unless you speak up. 
Either way, you should check each year for better car insurance rates and other types of insurance like home insurance. 
A 15 minute call could save you 15% or more on car insurance is actually true. 
Finally, there's the issue of your paycheck. 
You want your salary to go up at least enough to cover inflation -- and, more importantly, to get paid you what you're worth. 
Opportunities to get a salary bump usually happen once a year, so you 'll want to time your raise request and how you present it strategically -- especially if you're long overdue for one. 
Remember, you don't get what you don't ask for, and raises are one of those things that are expected and planned for in company budgets, but you might have to be proactive about bringing the subject up. 
To prep, figure out how much your job is worth with yearly visits to sites like Glassdoor, PayScale, and Salary.com.

I 've been writing about tech for nearly a decade now, and in that time, one thing has always seemed perpetually promising, and yet also ultimately unsatisfying: remote streaming consumer computing. 
I'm not talking about remotely connecting to your work PC to grab a couple of files, but actually using programs interchangeably with your own local apps, despite some being hosted and run entirely on a server in some data farm nearby. 
Inevitably, however, this idea has been met with the harsh truths of reality, which has led to situations like the original OnLive flameout, for instance. 
In the past, any of these solutions that I 've tried have come with serious downsides, including unreasonable requirements in terms of connection capabilities, up and downstream speeds, and more. 
They 've also performed in a manner that while sometimes workable, would not fit anyone's definition of a ` pleasant experience.' 
Local crashes are one thing, but when your app continually pixelates and refuses to acknowledge input it's incredibly frustrating. 
Lately, legacy companies that have so far stayed mostly away from the fray have gotten into the streamed software game, and that's a good sign that the market, and the tech behind it is maturing. 
Two recent examples are Adobe, which started showing off its previously announced version of Photoshop that streams in its entirety to a browser, and Nvidia, which launched its GRID remote gaming service for its Shield devices this past week. 
In their rundown of an eyes-on preview of the software, Ars Technica found that Photoshop streamed worked pretty much like the native app, without the usual browser chrome you'd expect from web content, and without taxing your system resources. 
It's still early in terms of a schedule for general public availability, but Adobe is making sure to get things right with at least six more months of limited testing before a broader roll out -- and caution is the watchword when it comes to any kind of virtualized app deployment. 
Nvidia's Grid underwent a similar lengthy testing program, and its debut is initially limited to North American users only before it makes its way to others. 
And the testing paid off ; Grid's reliability and performance are rock solid so far, besting competitors like the recently-launched PlayStation Now service and others, with performance that you'd expect from a high-end gaming PC, but running on your tablet with resolution that seems impossible given it's a streamed signal. 
The big immediate benefit here is to Google and the Chromebook, which could continue its trend of taking over the education market easily if it can move past the current restriction of local software. 
Ultimately, though, it's a shift that would democratize digital production on a grand scale -- Google, Facebook and others are already trying to connect the world with usable data connections, but also providing them access to powerful, modern day software on low-end or older used hardware would be offering up a full, refined toolkit, not just a lone large hammer. 
There are still many barriers in the way of a fully-streamed computing environment, but more of them drop day-by-day. 
Opposition to net neutrality, and the price of efficient, high-bandwidth connections might be the last thing standing in the way of ubiquitous, high-functioning local computing, but it's no longer just the province of pioneering startups taking big risks on a market that's not even real enough to be called emerging. 
A football dream ended in Texas last night, as the little town of Booker saw its high school team lose for the first time this year, eliminating them from the state playoffs. 
But Booker High School has plenty to celebrate -- the 29 players on its team include the state's all-time leading passer and leading receiver. 
But the Booker squad lost Friday night, falling to Quanah High School in a 42-12 upset in the Class 2A Division II playoffs. 
The game ended the career of Booker's senior quarterback Hunter Lile, who became the most prolific passer in Texas high school history this season after throwing for more than 14,256 yards. 
Many of those throws fell into the hands of Lile's cousin, Jared Reagan, who's also a senior. 
Reagan finished his career as the leading receiver in Texas high school history, with more than 313 catches -- two spots ahead of the NFL's Jordan Shipley who still holds the mark for most yards. 
This year, Reagan caught passes for more than 1,720 yards. 
Thanks to the blessing of crowdfunding, the internet has more product concepts and design ideas and badly-rendered napkin sketches than ever before. 
But despite the seemingly endless number of people willing to give money to hastily-thought-out sketches, some legitimately great ideas have never seen the light of day. 
My nomination goes to the Flower lens hood/cap you can see above, which gives you a protective lens cap that you don't have to take off every time you want a photo -- twist the dial, and the cap expands out to become a lens hood. 
In the past year, I 've lost three lens caps, and with glove season back with a vengeance, that number will probably be going up. 
Sadly, the Flower was designed in 2011, before Kickstarter had completely taken over the internet, so the concept was left as just that. 
But I probably stumble back over the renderings every year or so, and it's a painful reminder of how the internet has failed me. 
But in the grand scheme of things, a camera accessory probably isn't the greatest loss. 
What do you think is the greatest design that was never made? 
Thanksgiving is meant to be a time of reflection and solemn appreciation of the joyful bounties that our lives have bestowed upon us -- or, more likely, a time to gorge on football marathons and good food. 
But who wants to spend every waking turkey day hour over a hot stove? 
Not you. 
Here's how you can cook an entire Thanksgiving feast using nothing but your microwave. 
They don't call it Turkey Day for nothing. 
Your bird is the centerpiece of the meal and better be done right -- even if you are just nuking it. 
In fact, cooking a turkey in your microwave is, in some ways, even easier than conventional oven roasting I'm looking at you, basters. 
So long as the bird fits inside the oven -- with at least three inches overhead and another inch or two on either side -- and doesn't weigh more than 12 to 14 pounds, you should be set. 
Just because you can't cook it in the the bird doesn't mean your microwaved holiday meal must do without the bready deliciousness that is stuffing. 
And as Food.com contributor Northern_Reflectionz shows, you 'll spend more time collecting the ingredients than you will actually cooking it. 
With even the best cooked bird, you're going to need some starches to help fill up your guests' plates. 
Luckily, making mashed potatoes in the microwave is just as easy on the stovetop. 
Here's what you 'll need, get the full recipe on What's Cooking America 
Whisk 2 tablespoons of all purpose flour into 2 tablespoons of turkey drippings. 
Add 1 cup of heavy cream, 1 cup chicken or ve broth, and mix until smooth. 
Cook on high for 3 minutes, then remove from the microwave and add salt and pepper to taste. 
What, you eat cranberry sauce out of a can? 
Are you some sort of philistine? 
Do you not realize how ridiculously simple it is to make fresh cranberry sauce right there in your microwave? 
Just check out this recipe from Food.com. 
It just wouldn't be Turkey Day without candied yams. 
And with this simple recipe from Cooks.com, you 'll be able to put the dish together during halftime. 
No Thanksgiving meal would be complete without something sweet. 
But since you microwave likely doesn't come with a bake option, conventional pies are right out. 
Instead, treat your guests to this delicious Apple Crisp from All Recipes. 
This week, the family home of Palestinian Abdel Rahman Shaludi was destroyed. 
Last month, Shaludi, age 20, drove a car into a crowd of people waiting for a light rail train, killing a 3-month-old baby immediately and injuring eight others, including a woman visiting from Ecuador who later died. 
They didn't ring or knock on the door, says Shaludi's mother, Enas Shaludi, 43. 
They only pushed in the door, rushed in and began to scream. 
She says they were given five minutes to get on warm clothes and told to each take a blanket. 
Their family home is four stories tall, each floor with two apartments, each apartment the home of an extended family member. 
Five days before the soldiers arrived, Israel had warned the family their home would be destroyed. 
So the parents and remaining five children had moved out their belongings and were sleeping in a relative's apartment on the same floor. 
It was dark, but we see the flashes and lights, says Enas Shaludi. 
We heard breaking stones. 
By the time they returned, the floor of the destroyed apartment was covered in concrete rubble. 
One wall of the attacker's bedroom was still standing, the lower half decorated in blue wallpaper with a pattern of hot air balloons. 
Tamir Shaludi, an uncle of Abdel Rahman, the attacker, owns the apartment just upstairs. 
He says soldiers broke his door and a mirrored table, turned over furniture, and emptied drawers and cupboards. 
I am very upset at what happened to my brother's apartment, he said, referring to the father of attacker Abdel Rahman Shaludi. 
But I am even angrier that I'm punished too. 
Because I have never had one thought of even picking up a stone and throwing it at Israelis. 
Israel plans to destroy the family homes of the two Palestinians who attacked the synagogue. 
Dick says he wishes Israel didn't have to. 
We are never in favor of aggression, he said. 
But I would be in favor of it, if that's what it takes to save lives. 
Israel stopped such home demolitions after military leaders questioned its effectiveness nearly a decade ago. 
According to statistics of the Israeli human rights group B'tselem, Israel destroyed just over 650 family homes of attackers between 2001 and 2004. 
Since then, the military has destroyed six homes for what B'tselem calls punitive reasons, including that of the Shaludi family. 
Israel decided to revive the practice earlier this year. 
With the recent spate of attacks in Jerusalem, Netanyahu vowed to speed them up. 
Knesset member Dov Lipman says he knows much of the world sees the practice as vindictive and collective punishment. 
But, despite the long hiatus of the practice, he believes it works. 
We know from interrogations over the years there are young people who do not carry out terror attacks because they know there will be implications for their families, he said. 
The moment we know that, we have to do it.

Thanksgiving is meant to be a time of reflection and solemn appreciation of the joyful bounties that our lives have bestowed upon us -- or, more likely, a time to gorge on football marathons and good food. 
But who wants to spend every waking turkey day hour over a hot stove? 
Not you. 
Here's how you can cook an entire Thanksgiving feast using nothing but your microwave. 
They don't call it Turkey Day for nothing. 
Your bird is the centerpiece of the meal and better be done right -- even if you are just nuking it. 
In fact, cooking a turkey in your microwave is, in some ways, even easier than conventional oven roasting I'm looking at you, basters. 
So long as the bird fits inside the oven -- with at least three inches overhead and another inch or two on either side -- and doesn't weigh more than 12 to 14 pounds, you should be set. 
Just because you can't cook it in the the bird doesn't mean your microwaved holiday meal must do without the bready deliciousness that is stuffing. 
And as Food.com contributor Northern_Reflectionz shows, you 'll spend more time collecting the ingredients than you will actually cooking it. 
With even the best cooked bird, you're going to need some starches to help fill up your guests' plates. 
Luckily, making mashed potatoes in the microwave is just as easy on the stovetop. 
Here's what you 'll need, get the full recipe on What's Cooking America 
Whisk 2 tablespoons of all purpose flour into 2 tablespoons of turkey drippings. 
Add 1 cup of heavy cream, 1 cup chicken or ve broth, and mix until smooth. 
Cook on high for 3 minutes, then remove from the microwave and add salt and pepper to taste. 
What, you eat cranberry sauce out of a can? 
Are you some sort of philistine? 
Do you not realize how ridiculously simple it is to make fresh cranberry sauce right there in your microwave? 
Just check out this recipe from Food.com. 
It just wouldn't be Turkey Day without candied yams. 
And with this simple recipe from Cooks.com, you 'll be able to put the dish together during halftime. 
No Thanksgiving meal would be complete without something sweet. 
But since you microwave likely doesn't come with a bake option, conventional pies are right out.

Patrons is an app makes it easy to hook your place of business up with a band that has a little bit of free time before a performance. 
The idea is that the artist can pick up an extra gig while in town for another performance. 
It's an offshoot from live music booking marketplace Gigit. 
According to founder Tegan Gaan, you can also book yoga instructors and all sorts of other performers on the app, too. 
We used Patrons to get Act as If to come play at TechCrunch headquarters here in San Francisco. 
It was a sort of NPR style Tiny Desk Concert. 
I sat down with Gaan before the band went on to learn a bit more about how the app works. 
You may not be familiar with Act as If, but you 've probably heard a few of their songs. 
The band is starting to blow up on the music scene. 
They 've already been featured in the CW's Pretty Little Liars, an Apple commercial for the OS X Lion and MTV's Jersey Shore. 
Act as If just dropped their new album, Steady. 
Several outlets have started to feature music from the album, including KROQ, Fuse, Buzz Bands LA, Pure Volume and Buzznet.

Over the last few months enterprise giants Oracle and Salesforce have put on shows featuring the likes of Hillary Clinton and Bruno Mars reminding all of us in the enterprise world that marketing matters. 
While most enterprise startups will never reach these levels of budget and glamour, this time of the year does serve as a reminder that enterprise marketing matters. 
More than 10 years ago, prior to becoming a venture capitalist, I was a marketing guy at Xilinx, a semiconductor company. 
I recall creating spreadsheets with tens, if not hundreds, of rows, outlining our marketing plans. 
It was a grind, but I didn't know any better as a former customer-facing engineer who had a pretty good sense of all the things that would appeal to different types of customers. 
While it was certainly laborious and manual, three years later we had a $ 100 million business that we built by effectively extolling the virtues of our products to a new set of customers. 
That experience informed my view on marketing, specifically in the enterprise. 
The tools, channels and tactics available to marketers has changed a lot since the early 2000s -- we didn't have MailChimp or Marketo, nor did we have Google Adwords or Twitter ads -- but many of the same strategies we employed then still have value today. 
Talking to analysts, writing white papers, hosting events and doing road shows have been and always will be a critical part of a successful marketing plan. 
Perhaps the biggest misconception in marketing today, is that there are a few foolproof silver bullet strategies that marketers can rely on in order to succeed. 
Marketing is a decathlon -- winning requires you to be very good at multiple disciplines. 
In the consumer world it is well understood that Google wasn't the first search engine and Facebook wasn't initially the leader in social networking. 
Both came from behind and became universally loved by their users because of their products and the timing of their products, not because they were first or because they called themselves the leader in their respective space. 
It's not too different in the enterprise. 
Being first can actually be a weight as you're tasked with evangelizing and creating market awareness which manifests itself into more time needed to convince buyers and longer periods of time burning cash. 
That can trickle down into more dilution and fatigue for the team because of the extra cash and length of time required to be successful. 
Market timing and achieving product-market fit is so much more important than being first. 
So don't lead with first to ... or leader in ... Both are overrated. 
As the saying goes, you can't judge a book by its cover. 
Well your company's name and branding is its cover, and it better be tight from the get go. 
As someone who looks at early-stage startups, I consider a company name and one-liner a direct line into a founder's mind as to how crisply they are thinking about their business. 
It's an easy way to judge the book, and your eventual customers will judge you the same way. 
So keep it simple and make it mean something. 
Branding matters. 
Messaging matters. 
If it's too complicated or buzzword-filled, I see it as a red flag, because you may not even know what you're in the business of. 
Simplicity is key because when working with complex technologies, marketing and branding is how you make a company and its products more relatable. 
This is certainly true of consumer products, but the best product doesn't necessarily win in the enterprise. 
A great product is obviously important, but great product marketing is even more important. 
You have to constantly extoll the virtues of it, but even more importantly, you have to be able to convey a simple value proposition that creates a reaction. 
It starts by having a website that shows that you are open for business. 
Customers need to instinctively and immediately be able to say I get what this does for me, I know how much it costs, I understand how to adopt and deploy it, and it helps me do what I need to get done faster and better. 
Even if you're a two-person company, you can make yourself look open for business and make it seem much bigger than you actually are. 
It can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, as success begets success. 
This is what people say when they don't want to dig into the numbers. 
Funnels and conversion metrics don't lie, so more than ever marketers need to be analytical and multi-prong in their approach to drive cost-effective leads into the top of the funnel. 
Whether it's free trials, social, SEO, search engine marketing, webinars, syndicated articles or some other demand generation activity -- everything needs to be instrumented and measured. 
Marketers need to constantly evaluate what's working and what's not, so that their spend is as efficient as it can be while still growing their new leads. 
It's a lot of trial and error, and over time the effectiveness of marketing channels degrades. 
So always be experimenting to find the next best channel. 
And there are literally hundreds of of tools on the market to choose from to help you do your job more analytically. 
It was not long ago that events and conferences were deemed old school. 
While macro tradeshows that cover multiple vendors and various far-flung topics may have become obsolete, we 've definitely seen a surge in the number of companies hosting their own conferences and industry events. 
Now anyone who wants to be someone is hosting large user conferences. 
Established companies like Salesforce, VMWare, Oracle and even more recently, Amazon, put on big events every year. 
Even larger startups like Box *, Evernote and Twilio, have built quality events that customers look forward to every year. 
Smaller companies are starting to get in on the act even earlier with large-scale user conferences to demonstrate thought leadership and create broader awareness. 
Just like myth No. 3 about products selling themselves, if you present yourself like the it company in your category, maybe potential customers will think you are it, too. 
Putting on your own event is not cheap and requires insane levels of coordination and creativity. 
Smart startups will budget for it and spend their year planning it with high production value, interesting speakers from outside the company and key influencers. 
And it's okay to start small. 
Box had dreams of being a big company way before it was one. 
In 2011, the company decided that in order to be taken seriously by large enterprise customers, it had to host a high-caliber user event -- the first ever Boxworks, which was preceded by many smaller customer events. 
Boxworks has become one of the signature conferences every year, thanks to its great blend of content. 
Today Box is 10 times bigger in terms of revenue than it was in 2011, in no small part thanks to efforts like Boxworks. 
Believe it or not analysts still hold the keys to the kingdom for many categories in the enterprise. 
CIOs of the largest companies are influenced by these analysts, to the point where analysts have the ability to anoint the winners in any particular category of enterprise software. 
It is critical for companies to engage analysts early and develop a relationship over time with regular check-ins. 
Analysts set the tone for the market and if they aren't on a business' radar, a business isn't on theirs. 
Every company needs to have an actionable plan for meeting with analysts and educating them on new product development to ensure they're not mis - or underrepresented in the marketplace. 
You won't be in the top right quadrant from the get go, but investing in these relationships will allow you to tell and refine your story especially for large enterprises, who analysts often cater to. 
You have to keep in mind that someone is paying for their research and these analysts are trying to appease that someone with their work. 
Well, this one is actually true. 
But you can't just rely on your customers to tweet about how great your company or your product is. 
It takes more than that. 
Videos and case studies are a great way to make your company and its products approachable by connecting them with a human face. 
Put them on your website and organize them by vertical so that prospective customers can quickly find someone relatable. 
I love the depth and breadth of the customer examples that Hubspot provides on its website. 
It is important to debunk these common myths of marketing as it is one of the most important things a business can do to impact their bottom line. 
I believe that if enterprise companies can avoid these marketing myths they will be even more successful. 
What other marketing misconceptions do you think are still prevalent in the enterprise? 
Do you agree or disagree with the myth I have laid out? 
As Nigeria's military continues to battle Boko Haram fighters for control of towns and territory in the turbulent northeast, fearful residents are leaving -- or being driven out of town. 
More than 200 schoolgirls, abducted by the Islamist extremists in April, are still missing. 
The deadly insurgency has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, who are ending up in camps around Yola, the capital city of Adamawa, one of three northern states still under emergency rule. 
Concerned that Yola, too, may be attacked, others are again on the move. 
A large open-top truck parked at a gas station on the outskirts of Yola is already overflowing with children and women. 
Men are hoisting more people, buckets, bundles and spare tires onto the back of the truck, amid much chatter and palpable panic. 
The military says it's now in control of Mubi, but the displaced who found their way to Yola are not returning. 
Instead, they are fleeing further from their homes. 
Why? 
Yola is not safe. 
We are hearing rumors, he says. 
Boko Haram, they prepare -LSB- to -RSB- come to Yola. 
We are afraid. 
Clutching her baby girl in her arms, and poised to flee again, Liyatu Joshua, mother of five, just wants out of Yola. 
In a mixture of English and the local Hausa language, she says they they all are scared of the fighting -- and of Boko Haram. 
It is definitely worrisome to the good people of Adamawa state. 
It's worrisome to the government of Adamawa state, he says. 
There is no two ways about that. 
Many Nigerians accuse the army -- and the government -- of failing to counter Boko Haram and end the insurgency. 
Mohammed Sanusi II, the emir of Kano and one of the nation's most revered traditional and Muslim leaders, this week called on residents in the north to arm and defend themselves -- and to not rely on the military or fear the militants. 
Before the soldiers arrive, the terrorists would already have committed their crimes, says the emir. 
Speaking Hausa, he says some soldiers throw away their guns and flee. 
Since it launched last month, Apple's mobile payment system has been doing pretty well for itself. 
But the list of participating stores, while impressive, is dominated by big names. 
Thanks to plans to team up with Square, a credit-card processing service for small firms, that could all change. 
In its current guise, Square is mostly a mobile credit-card reader that lets small businesses -- think artists, or moms selling home-made jewellery on the side -- process credit card payments without the need for an expensive point-of-sale terminal. 
But thanks to its forays into the world of mobile payments, many people saw it as a competitor to Apple Pay. 
But according to Square's founder, Jack Dorsey, Square is really a -LSB- cash -RSB- register, and this register accepts all these forms of payments. 
To that end, Dorsey is planning to build Apple Pay compatability into Square's service, starting sometime next year. 
According to CNN's report, that will require hardware changes to Square's existing mobile card reader, which is a module that plugs into smartphones. 
But with most handsets already featuring a NFC reader, the capability might be there to allow for Apple Pay transactions without new Square hardware -- or, in theory, any hardware at all. 
All that means Apple Pay might become the payments system of choice for small businesses and self-employed folk -- provided that Square can get all the technicalities sorted out, of course.

Ebola is on the rise in Sierra Leone's capital of Freetown. 
Just this week, 234 new confirmed infections were reported, and every day hundreds of residents call the emergency line to report more possible cases in their neighborhoods. 
Sow clutches a sheaf of papers with the names and addresses of today's list of suspected Ebola sufferers. 
He jumps into the back of a green pickup, and soon he turns off the thoroughfare onto a rutted dirt road. 
The pickup passes mud brick huts with corrugated metal roofs. 
Ebola has hit this place hard, and the evidence is everywhere. 
Sow points to a boarded-up house. 
As you can see, there is nobody there, he says. 
There were 11 inhabitants. 
Nine of them died. 
A middle-aged man shuffles out and takes a seat on the front porch. 
He looks haggard. 
Sow and his team stand a good distance away, and they can barely hear him. 
The man points to his throat and says, It's hurting. 
Two of his children recently died of Ebola. 
Well, we have given the report to the command center, he says. 
It's left for the ambulance to come take them. 
But when -- or even whether -- the ambulance will arrive is another story. 
Sow says right now, Freetown's treatment centers don't have enough beds for all the people falling sick. 
Patients stay in their houses and die, waiting for an ambulance that doesn't come. 
So therefore, when we come there also the second time, they will not -LSB- be -RSB- happy, he says. 
More than 80 percent of the places, they blame us, every day. 
Still, he sees signs of improvement. 
Earlier this day, the team stopped at a house where two sick children had been left alone after their parents and nine other relatives died of Ebola. 
The ambulance showed up while the team was still there. 
Team leader Tomeh Bangura is an older man, a fatherly figure to the others. 
He says the image of those kids being led out by a nurse in protective gear is still haunting him. 
The eldest, I think she was 8, Bangura says. 
She was in the house, locked herself in the house. 
And it was not possible for us to open. 
So luckily when the ambulance came the nurse was in her -LSB- personal protective equipment -RSB-. 
We sprayed the place and took the child from the house into the ambulance. 
I felt so bad. 
A half-hour drive takes the team to a community health clinic, where the workers meets with a pregnant woman and her husband. 
They ask her to sit in a plastic chair in the yard. 
Her name is Kadiatu Kargbo. 
She's dressed in a lace skirt and sparkly flip-flops, and picks at her fingernails while Sow calls out questions from his list. 
Sow finds vomiting/nausea on his list and checks the Yes box. 
He thinks she probably has malaria, but based on her symptoms she 'll need to be tested for Ebola. 
Kargbo's husband looks worried. 
What if she gets exposed to people who do have the disease while she's waiting at a holding center? 
I don't want to take this girl and to mix -LSB- her -RSB- with other sick people, he says. 
We don't know what her status -LSB- is -RSB- yet. 
The day grows dark, and at the final stop, a hut shaded by tall trees, the village head man calls for a 15-year-old boy, Alusine Banguar, to come out. 
The head man says he's been calling the emergency line about this boy for three days. 
The boy walks over slowly, wearily, and sits on a tire in his yard. 
They go through the checklist. 
A large crowd gathers, and starts piping up with complaints. 
It seems another 15-year-old -- this one a girl -- recently died of apparent Ebola in a house nearby. 
Her relatives are supposed to be under quarantine, but they 've been walking around freely. 
One of the youth leaders asks for police enforcement. 
Bangura explains that his team has nothing to do with quarantines, and the crowd starts to calm down. 
Still, as Bangura heads back to the pickup, he looks tired. 
The scenes he's witnessing on this job are alarming him. 
Last night, he says, he had a serious talk with his wife. 
I advised my wife, on no account should any of my children step out of this compound, he says. 
They should stay indoors. 
I said, ` Ebola is becoming very serious. 
Very, very serious.'

I'm not going to say don't wait for it, but in my opinion, the Crucial is probably worth the extra $ 15.

Despite all the efforts to the contrary, it's an uncomfortable truth that our world mostly still runs on oil, made from dead little creatures and pumped from under the ocean. 
So a machine that could generate oil, without the need for drills or rigs or pipelines, just by combining hydrogen and CO2, sounds quite attractive. 
Manufactured by Germany company Sunfire, the key element is the Fischer-Tropsch process, which turns carbon monoxide and hydrogen into liquid hydrocarbons. 
To get from having water and CO2 to having hydrogen and carbon monoxide, there are a few steps: firstly, the water is turned into steam, and the oxygen and hydrogen separated in solid oxide electrolyser cells. 
The hydrogen is then used to reduce CO2 down to carbon monoxide, which is combined with hydrogen to give some sweet, sweet hydrocarbons. 
The process isn't quite as magical as it sounds, as it requires quite a lot of electricity in the first place, in order to turn water into steam. 
But at the moment, Sunfire is claiming that the whole process is about 70 percent energy efficient -- much better than conventional diesel or petrol engines. 
In terms of scale, one of the machines pictured above, which costs seven figures, can produce about a barrel of fuel per day, while recycling 3.2 tonnes of CO2. 
On that basis, it's going to take a hell of a lot of machines and cash! 
to meet our demand for fossil fuels -- the US alone averages 18 million barrels per day.

Mashed potatoes are easy: boil some potatoes and mash them. 
Starting the process with cold water make sure the potatoes cook evenly. 
Most of the time when you're cooking vegetables, you want to start with hot water. 
Potatoes, says The Kitchn, are an exception: 
While it's best to begin the cooking process with hot water for most vegetables, this isn't the case with potatoes. 
Adding potatoes to already hot water increases the chances of uneven cooking. 
The outside of the potato will end up overcooked, while the inside will remain firm and underdone. 
After you boil the potatoes, dry them before you mash them for potato perfection.

Mice and bugs realize your house is warmer than it is outside.

Most of us don't like the middle seat on a plane. 
We're crammed between two people. 
If those seats are all that is available on the flight, you aren't always stuck. 
Check in with the airlines right before the flight for a possible seat change. 
If you check in at the 24 hour mark, other seats may become available. 
Also, as passengers get upgraded you may be able to claim one of their vacated seats. 
For example, an elite flyer may be seated in an exit row, and they could be upgraded in the days leading up to the flight, leaving that exit row seat empty and waiting for you. 
Passengers also miss connecting flights so those seats become available shortly before departure. 
Even if you're in the air, you can tweet at the airlines to look for a better seat on a connecting flight. 
I do that all the time and have scored my coveted exit row on more than one occasion.

Citing great sorrow, great rage and great determination, University of Virginia President Teresa A. Sullivan says she's suspending all the school's fraternities until Jan. 9. 
The move comes days after a Rolling Stone article in which a woman described being gang-raped when she was a freshman in 2012. 
In a letter to the school's students Saturday, Sullivan said she has asked the Charlottesville police to investigate the incident. 
Her decision to place a temporary ban on fraternities follows a voluntary move by all UVA fraternities to suspend their social activities for this weekend. 
The Phi Kappa Psi fraternity was the target of an immediate backlash after the article was published. 
On Wednesday, its house was vandalized ; on Thursday, the chapter said it had voluntarily surrendered its fraternal agreement with UVA. 
Make no mistake, the acts depicted in the article are beyond unacceptable -- they are vile and intolerable in our brotherhood, our university community and our society, the group said in a letter to the school newspaper. 
We remain ready and willing to assist with the fair and swift pursuit of justice, wherever that may lead. 
In her absence, one of the university's first attempts to respond to the story backfired, when it hired former U.S. Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip to investigate the matter. 
After it was revealed that Filip had himself been a Phi Kappa Psi member at an Illinois college, he was taken off the job, local newspaper the Daily Progress reports. 
One comment came from Helen Drogas, who sits on the university's board. 
She asked that people share their stories in an alumni forum. 
And she added that she'd only this week learned of a friend's story. 
I learned that a college friend of mine had the exact same thing happen to her in a fraternity house, she wrote. 
I never knew it, and I was really shaken that women were being victimized then, and still are more than thirty years later. 
In 2012, George Lucas sold his company Lucasfilm to Disney for the staggering sum of $ 4 billion. 
Even more staggering is the $ 37 billion that Star Wars has raked in over the past 40 years. 
The Star Wars universe now comprises a vast array of products, from movies and TV shows to videogames and toys. 
But it all started with one movie, Star Wars later Star Wars: Episode IV -- A New Hope, whose modest $ 11 million budget was less than the average studio comedy at the time. 
The film's brash, upstart quality is part of its appeal. 
Those toys played a major role in the film's success, and helped bankroll its sequel, The Empire Strikes Back. 
But as with Star Wars itself, no one expected the toys to be popular. 
The demand caught fledgling toymaker Kenner completely off guard, and they resorted to selling empty boxes stuffed with promissory notes in lieu of actual Christmas merchandise. 
Even Lucas himself had no inkling about the public demand for Star Wars. 
He didn't even imagine action figures would be a big thing, says Chris Taylor, author of the new book How Star Wars Conquered the Universe. 
All he saw when he was first thinking about products that might emerge from Star Wars was an R2-D2 cookie jar. 
Taylor's book explores many of the financial concerns that shaped Star Wars, as well as some of the strategies that helped it succeed. 
It wasn't all smooth sailing. 
After the Emperor was vanquished in Return of the Jedi, toy sales fell dramatically. 
The story seemed over. 
As a boy Taylor resorted to imagining that the Emperor had been cloned, a plot twist that Lucas might have used to boost sales. 
The eventual success of Timothy Zahn's novel Heir to the Empire proved that there was still an audience for Star Wars, which helped motivate Lucas to release the special editions. 
Though controversial among fans, the special editions did help fund the prequel trilogy, which in turn grew the Star Wars brand into a multibillion-dollar franchise which seems set to continue indefinitely. 
He was a smart businessman, George Lucas, says Stillman. 
He really knew what he was doing. 
The thing about movies, you didn't license with them because they were there and gone pretty quickly. 
They didn't last very long, and unlike a TV show, which gives you an advertisement for that toy every week, every time it airs, once the movie's gone there's nothing in theory to compel you to go buy the toys. 
So Kenner approached the whole thing with easy-to-produce, inexpensive-to-produce objects like games, paper products, things that were cheap. 
And when they saw how successful Star Wars was, pretty quickly they realized they had to have toys. 
Well, at the time it took about a year to get a toy onto the stands. 
They realized they'd never make it in time for Christmas. 
Star Wars came out in May, it's only a few months away, so what they did was -- it's kind of the brilliance of a guy named Ed Schifman, who pitched this idea to Kenner and to the president Bernie Loomis -- which was, what if we release a ` redemption kit'? 
Essentially an empty box. 
It was called the Early Bird Certificate Package, and you got an empty cardboard envelope, and in it was a little certificate you could mail away, and then Kenner would send you the figures when they were ready, which turned out to be around February or March. 
So for Christmas you'd run downstairs, tear open the wrapping paper, and you'd get a piece of cardboard. 
There were definitely a lot of points during Empire Strikes Back when Lucas was basically running out of money, because he'd put up the collateral himself. 
It was all his winnings from Star Wars, and he was just basically doubling down by doing Empire Strikes Back. 
And there was a loan with Bank of America, but that loan was suspended when Lucasfilm payroll hit a million dollars a week. 
That just triggered some automatic stop on some new manager's bureaucratic system, and so there were a lot of times when they desperately needed an influx of new cash. 
I believe the Christmas of ’78 was the crucial season where they made way more money than they expected out of the -LSB- action -RSB- figures. 
... So it's kind of poetic that all of these kids in Christmas of ’78 acting out the further adventures of Luke Skywalker actually almost literally funded the future adventures of Luke Skywalker. 
-LSB- Lucas -RSB- very much treated The Empire Strikes Back as an ongoing business concern. 
You have to have insurance if Mark Hamill, god forbid, has another car crash, what are we going to do? 
Well, let's drop in a mention of Luke's sister -- who was not Leia at this point -- being across the galaxy, and that sort of became Yoda talking about the ` other.' 
That was what it referred to. 
Lando was the insurance against Han Solo. 
And you start to introduce the Emperor with the idea that he would become the main villain, and Vader would just be killed off in the next film, and you sort of start to focus on the big bad boss. 
Because Lucas still didn't get that Vader was as big a deal as he was -- this of course is before he came up with the ` I am your father' revelation. 
So yeah, it really is a case of a businessman buying insurance. 
I thought that was a genius move on the part of Kathleen Kennedy and J.J. Abrams to use the R2 Builders Club, which if folks don't know, it's this club of about seven or eight thousand people around the planet, who are all endeavoring to create a screen-accurate, functional R2-D2. 
And I 've seen a number of their R2-D2s, and they are just gorgeous, and everyone flocks to them. 
They go to Maker Faire events, and people just love it, but it does take a long time to do. 
Then again, 7,000 people, that's a very powerful fanbase to have on your side. 
They're better constructed than the ILM versions, and they don't go racing off and crashing into walls and losing their domes, as they used to, but also simultaneously it's a way to ingratiate yourself with fandom. 
So absolutely a genius business move, and I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of that. 
Look, the Internet is a big place, and it's not easy to keep up with everything that you should. 
We understand. 
But there's no longer any need to worry: We 've taken what you really need to have an opinion about in terms of Internet pop culture and pushed it all into one place for you. 
VH1's Bye, Felicia? 
Bill Cosby's problematic silence? 
Lenny Kravitz's Fly Away turned into a piece of disturbing genius? 
It's all here. 
Think of it as a short primer on what you might want to have an opinion on over the next couple of days. 
What Really Happened: Sick of those YouTube song uploads with lyrics? 
So is Neil Cicierega, which explains this terrifying moment of genius uploaded to YouTube with the appropriate caption this is my first video, hope you enjoy! 
:-RRB-. 
The Takeaway: Man. 
Anyone else really want a Milky Way now? 
What Really Happened: Hey, remember when the world collectively realized that Queer Eye for a Straight Guy was, you know, kind of objectifying and offensive when you stopped to think about it? 
The collective hive mind of television executives apparently doesn't, doubling down on the Maybe -LSB- the non-straight/white demographic of choice -RSB- can help us be better high concept with the announcement of a new show in which sassy black women help clueless white women sort out their lives. 
December's Bye, Felicia will, according to VH1's announcement, empower ... women who could use a dose of honesty in order to turn their lives around. 
The announcement earlier specifies that the two life coaches, Deborah Hawkes and Missy Young, will only be helping white girls across the Los Angeles area, just to make everything clear. 
For those wondering where the title comes from, there was a sort-of explanation on On Air with Ryan Seacrest recently. 
As that clip quasi-suggests, it actually comes from from a scene in Friday. 
On a related note, bae is Dutch for poop. 
The Takeaway: What's even more surprising about Bye Felicia is that it's the second such show around right now. 
For the first, let's turn to Lifestyle and the even-more-appallingly-titled Girlfriend Intervention, which launched back in August. 
All we need is one more show like this, and we have a trend. 
Oh, please please please can FOX announce something with Basic Bitch in the title? 
That's exactly what we need right now. 
What Happened: Bill Cosby tweets Go ahead. 
Meme me! 
It almost immediately backfires when people start tweeting images of the comedian referencing rape allegations against him. 
He eventually gets asked about it during a radio interview -- and falls silent. 
What Really Happened: Look, Bill Cosby doesn't want to talk about the allegations of sexual assault surrounding him again, even if it is following what may be the worst social media PR disaster in recent memory. 
Seriously, he literally will not talk about them at all, as NPR host Scott Simon found out last weekend. 
In fact, he doesn't want to talk about them so much that his lawyer even issued a statement to that effect. 
Of course, that hasn't stopped everyone else talking about them, with yet another woman stepping up to accuse the comedian of rape this week. 
By now, much of the conversation surrounding the story has turned to the responsibility or otherwise of both NBC and Netflix to rethink their in-progress projects with Cosby, with CNN, Forbes and Deadline amongst the outlets suggesting that something should be done. 
What Happened: A writer for Time suggests banning the word feminist. 
Feminists, rightfully, don't take too kindly to that suggestion. 
What Really Happened: Poor Katy Steinmetz. 
After spending almost a week dealing with the pushback from her tone-deaf at the very least suggestion that feminist was a word that we should consider banning -- let's stick to the issues and quit throwing this label around like ticker tape at a Susan B. Anthony parade, she argued -- Steinmetz ended up being thrown under a bus when Time editor Nancy Gibbs apologized for the inclusion of the word in the poll last weekend. 
The word ` feminist' should not have been included in a list of words to ban, Gibbs wrote. 
We regret that its inclusion has become a distraction from the important debate over equality and justice. 
In addition, the outlet also ran an op-ed from Robin Morgan defending the term. 
The Takeaway: This is what happens when your poll gets hijacked by online trolls, apparently. 
Although there are many other reasons to be concerned about the poll, even if you overlook the inclusion of feminist. 
Maybe Time should think about banning its banned word poll next year, just to be safe. 
What Happened: Previously unseen footage purporting to be a collaboration between Hostel director Eli Roth, Marilyn Manson and Lana del Rey leaked online, showing del Rey being sexually abused by Roth. 
Representatives for Manson quickly issued a statement distancing the singer from the footage. 
What Really Happened: The video, which Roth said in a 2013 interview was so sick, the footage has been locked in a vault for over a year, appeared online mid-week as part of a reel for LA-based art collective Strumgruppe. 
In part of the footage, Roth pushes del Rey's head into a pillow during a simulated sex scene, attempting to muffle her screams ; elsewhere, another woman covered in blood has her head pushed underwater. 
Following outcry over the release of the video, Marilyn Manson's management issued a statement saying that the singer did not direct this, shoot it, nor was it for a Marilyn Manson video or outtake footage made by him or to be used by him with his music. 
Instead, it was suggested that the footage was a fan video splicing up old Manson video footage with someone else's Lana Del Rey footage. 
The video was removed from YouTube, with the site citing a copyright claim by -LSB- Merlin -RSB- Essential Music as the reason why. 
The Takeaway: With both Roth and del Rey silent on the online debut of the footage as of writing, it's unclear what to make of this story. 
Both Manson's denial of connection with the footage and Roth's 2013 commentary suggest that they were aware of how transgressive it was, and that it arguably went too far in the name of shock value to be released. 
With the footage now removed from YouTube, it's likely that this will become part of the urban myths surrounding all three participants and their willingness to push boundaries, even if -- as in this case -- they might have pushed too far. 
What Really Happened: As Serial, the long form spin-off of This American Life, continues, we 've reached the inevitable point where the backlash is underway. 
Sure, you might be enjoying Sarah Koenig's reporting on the investigation of the 1999 murder of Have Min Lee, but have you considered her white privilege? 
Maybe that's impacting Koenig's understanding of the social world of both Adnan and Hae in the first place. 
Maybe you're just enjoying the show too much, especially considering its translation of real world tragedy into weekly unfolding narrative. 
Hell, you might even be someone who is trawling through a grieving family's pain as a form of entertainment. 
The Takeaway: Judging by the speed at which the backlash arrived -- Serial is, after all, only eight weeks old -- we can expect the backlash to the backlash any minute now. 
In addition to interest from Hollywood in terms of a future adaptation, it's become the fastest podcast to reach five million streams and downloads through iTunes, so clearly someone is still enjoying it. 
Well, besides Mail Chimp, of course. 
Let's wait and see how upset the Internet gets now that the show's regular Thursday updates are about to be disrupted by Thanksgiving and we 'll find out how many people really care. 
What Happened: A band got stuck in some snow. 
I mean, really stuck. 
What Really Happened: In what sounds like a terrible movie waiting to happen, the band Interpol found themselves trapped aboard their tour bus for almost 50 hours this week, when a snowstorm stranded them on the road as they tried to leave Buffalo, New York. 
Thankfully, they had food, drink and social media to entertain them during this time: 
Brandon took this snap of our scenery. 
Sheeeeeeeiiiiiit.-DK pic.twitter.com/X6AjoKe4gT 
Hour 13 trapped in the snow. 
Dry goods and vodka. 
We will make it. 
- DK pic.twitter.com/bEQhaUokKi 
Still trapped yo! 
Haven't really moved in 30 hours and we 've been on the bus for nearly 40 hours. 
Nutso. 
Never seen anything like it.-DK 
Settling in for another night. 
Haven't moved all day. 
Hoping the expected storm tonight ain't as bad as predicted. 
C'mon now now.-DK 
Finally just started making a move. 
50 + hours later. 
Hoping for some luck today.-DK pic.twitter.com/2cpeu1lxQn 
So ... Paul is all like British people don't like peanut butter and I'm like, not true. 
Public opinion ?! 
Peanut butter is awesome.-DK. 
Truth. 
The Takeaway: No matter how comfortable and well-stocked that tour bus was, there's no way that two full days of house arrest bus arrest? 
could have been fun. 
In fact, this could be the kind of thing that will either cement the band's commitment to each other or tear them apart forever. 
Obviously, everyone is pulling for the former ; if nothing else, imagine the concept album about the experience they could come up with. 
What Happened: Daniel Handler tried to make a joke about author Jacqueline Woodson at the National Book Awards. 
Let's just say that he failed. 
What Really Happened: Handler better known as Lemony Snicket, the writer behind the A Series of Unfortunate Events books was the host of the 2014 National Book Awards this year, and during the ceremony, he presented Jacqueline Woodson with the Young People's Literature Award for her book Brown Girl Dreaming. 
After she accepted the award, Handler told the audience, I told Jackie she was going to win, and I said that if she won, I would tell all of you something I learned about her this summer, which is that Jackie Woodson is allergic to watermelon. 
Just let that sink in your mind. 
Yes, Daniel, we're letting the fact that you just made a this black woman is allergic to watermelon, isn't that insane joke in 2014 A.D. into our minds. 
But wait, you're saying. 
Maybe he didn't mean it in a racist way! 
Maybe there's some other, entirely inexplicable reason he finds that anecdote worth sharing! 
Yes, that would explain why he followed it up by saying I'm only writing a book about a black girl who's allergic to watermelon if I get a blurb from you, Cornell West, Toni Morrison, and Barack Obama saying ` This guy's OK. 
This guy's fine. 
''' 
Understandably, condemnation of Handler's comments was quick in arriving, over social media and in pieces from Gawker, The Huffington Post and The Washington Post amongst many others. 
The day after the ceremony, Handler took to Twitter to apologize, writing that his job was to shine a light on tremendous writers, including Jacqueline Woodson, and not to overshadow their achievements with my own ill-conceived attempts at humor. 
I clearly failed, and I'm sorry. 
The Takeaway: Let's ignore the obvious Don't be a racist ass lesson we can all learn from this for a moment -- I know, I know, it's hard ; I'm as stunned that he actually thought that joke was anything other than the worst idea at the time as you are -- because that, surely, should be taken as read. 
What 'll be interesting to see what happens now that he's apologized, and to see everyone's reaction to that particular apology, which feels very much of the I'm sorry you're mad school of thought as opposed to, you know, a genuine apology. 
But, yes: Don't be a racist ass is the real takeaway here. 
While the Saab 35 Draken may be the coolest, most futuristic combat jet ever made, when it comes to bombers that title goes to the XB-70 Valkyrie, a gigantic supersonic strategic nuclear bomber that never entered service. 
Seriously, when I say gigantic I really mean it. 
This thing is unbelievable -- check the image below. 
There were only two prototypes built of the North American Aviation XB-70 Valkyrie before the project -- which wanted to create a nuclear bomber that could penetrate deeply into Soviet territory at supersonic speeds and very high altitude -- was cancelled. 
Powered by six engines, the Valkyrie was that bomber: It could could fly at 70,000 feet at Mach 3 +, which put it far from the reach Soviet fighter jets at the time. 
By 1961 the US Air Force knew that new high-altitude surface-to-air missiles could take down the XB-70, as demonstrated by the U-2 shot down in Soviet airspace on May 1, 1960. 
Then, the birth of the intercontinental ballistic missile -- which could deliver the same or more destruction power faster and with no human risk whatsoever -- was the final straw that killed this amazing bird. 
There's only one of these prototypes left at the National Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. 
The other one was destroyed in a mid-air collision during a test flight on June 8, 1966. 
Here are two photos taken just before the accident: 
The photo below was taken just after the collision. 
The ball of fire is the F-104 -- the one with the orange tail above -- that went under and touched the Valkyrie's right wing before flipping over and destroying the XB-70's vertical stabilizers and part of its left wing. 
The XB-70 spun out of control shortly after that, crashing against the ground before the pilots could eject. 
This is the story of that accident: 
Let's face it: Elon Musk is probably a time traveller sent back to help us leave earth behind and achieve the next phase of human evolution. 
The inventor and entrepreneur issued a minor tweet storm today, in which he detailed a new SpaceX program to test the function of X-Wing style grid fins that could help spacecraft navigate upon re-entry after delivering personnel or cargo to an orbiting space station. 
The SpaceX reusable rocket program has been progressing with varying results, including an explosion over Texas back in August. 
While the incident didn't result in any injury or even near injuries, Musk conceded in a tweet that this was evidence that -LSB- r -RSB- ockets are tricky. 
An earlier test flight from this summer involving an ocean splashdown was considered more successful, proving that the Space X Falcon 9 booster could re-enter earth's atmosphere, restart its engines, deploy its landing legs and make a touch down at near zero velocity. 
These new modifications to the rocket should make atmospheric navigation easier, with each fin operating independently to help control the craft's angle, speed and vector. 
They also fold up and stow during takeoff, so they don't add any additional drag. 
The autonomous spaceports are essentially seafaring landing pads, which can help make sure that re-entering craft are far from any populated areas in the event of any incident, while still providing a stable target for landing and launching spaceships. 
All of which is to say, once again, that Elon Musk and everything he does is pretty much amazing. 
Case in point: This is his last tweet before discussing these new Space X tests: 
As recently as the turn of the century, conventional wisdom had it that the tropical, Andean nation was on the verge of becoming a failed state. 
Fast forward to the present day and Colombia already boasts one of the region's stronger startup ecosystems, with huge potential upside still waiting to be explored. 
By 2018, the government hopes to have 63 percent of the country connected to broadband. 
And according to 2013 GSMA mobile economy figures, there are already 43.9 million mobile connections and 24 million mobile users in a country whose 47 million people give it the third largest population in Latin America and third largest Spanish-speaking population in the world. 
The first stage of the government's concerted campaign to rebrand Colombia as a technology center involved drawing in IT services with tax incentives and professional training programs. 
A $ 6.8 billion industry has taken strong root as a result, with 1,800 software development and IT service companies registered in the country. 
Looking forward, the hope is that IT, and the investments that went into promoting it, can diversify into a broader innovation ecosystem. 
With that in mind, the government has spurred a number of public initiatives to address the lack of venture capital in Colombia, currently the biggest ceiling on startup growth. 
Founded to support and promote tech innovation and new ventures, iNNpulsa awarded three grants of up to $ 800,000 in 2013 to investor groups establishing operations in Colombia. 
Apps.co is another, more tech-specific, government initiative. 
By the end of 2014, it's expected to have awarded $ 33 million in funding to accelerators and university partnership programs, according to the Atlantic. 
These and other efforts have succeeded in convincing big names like Facebook and Google that a favorable labor market and budding consumer base are worth investing in, with both companies opening permanent Colombian offices in recent years. 
Where the government's strategy has so far fallen short, however, is in replicating that sort of international success for homegrown Colombian companies. 
Examples of Colombian startups making a similar leap, or achieving sizable exits at all, are few and far between. 
. 
CO is easily Colombia's biggest startup success story, having been acquired by Neustar for $ 109 million in 2014. 
But after that, the field gets noticeably thin. 
PagosOnline, an online payment platform, and Click Delivery, an online delivery service, have probably come closer than anyone else to following in. 
CO's footsteps, and even so, the acquisitions went for a rumored $ 10 million and $ 15 million, respectively. 
It's good to see that the government is willing to stand behind innovation and recognizes that entrepreneurship is the motor of a successful economy, Michael Puscar, a successful venture capitalist, explains. 
But everyone, including the government, recognizes that public funding can't replace private initiatives in the long run, and especially not in a fast-paced business climate like the kind startups live in. 
Although there is debate on which Colombian city will eventually emerge as the country's startup center, Bogota retains the title up until this point. 
That's hardly a surprise, of course. 
The capital is home to the national government, most of the country's corporate and financial institutions, and the largest and most diverse ex-pat and immigrant community in the country. 
Colombia's most experienced startup founders are from Bogota, including Alex Torrenegra, a serial entrepreneur often talked about as the godfather of Colombia's startup scene. 
Torrenegra is the founder of VoiceBunny, a digital voice over marketplace, and one of the few Colombian startup entrepreneurs who has been able to transition to a distinguished international career. 
Most importantly, his commitment to sharing insights and leadership with the Colombian startup community have set an encouraging precedent. 
For years and across all industries, Colombia has been on the losing end of an epic brain drain that has sent many of its best and brightest abroad for good. 
Keeping that talent in the country is a key to unlocking the country's innovation potential, and Torrenegra had done more than his fair share to set an example in that regard. 
Already, we 've seen a lot of knowledge brought back and put to effective work in Bogota. 
Looking at notable institutions like HubBOG, a co-working space and incubator led by Rene Rojas which hosts weekly events and activities, Wayra, an accelerator built loosely according to the Y Combinator model, and Endeavor, a non-profit that supports high-impact Colombian entrepreneurs, it's easy to see the influence that global perspective is having. 
Other local leaders include Juan Diego Calle, founder of. 
CO ; Alan Colmenares, considered the heart of Colombia's startup ecosystem ; Catalina Ortiz, CEO of iNNpulsa, Andres Gutierrez and Juan Salcedo, founders of Tappsi ; Freddy Vega and Christian Van Der Henst, founders of Mejorando.la, an educational platform that surpassed $ 1 million in revenue in 2013 ; Diego Serebrisky, a partner at the Alta Ventures venture firm ; and Andres Barreto, who operates government accelerators across the country. 
Colombians will tell you it's no coincidence that Medellin won the most innovative city of the year in 2012. 
Paisas, as its residents are known, are famously business savvy and entrepreneurial -- traits that carry as much promise for the future as they have darkness in the past. 
The local startup scene still lags behind Bogota, but not by degrees, and the weather and business-friendly atmosphere have given it its own unique dynamic. 
Medellin today does not have the success stories that Bogota can refer to, but many believe that in the next decade it will become the nation's tech center. 
In fact, in 2013 the city government committed $ 389M over 10 years to technology and innovation. 
The center of Medellin's innovation scene is Ruta N, which is a government organization along the lines of Apps.co and iNNPulsa. 
Last year, it committed $ 3 million to the Velum Ventures venture capital firm. 
Medellin is caught in a paradox. 
Because it doesn't have success stories, the investor confidence needed to create new ones is low. 
Public initiatives have done what they can, but the current system is a weak substitute for badly needed private capital. 
In Barranquilla, on the Caribbean coast, the startup ecosystem revolves around Koombea and its charismatic founder, Jonathan Tarud. 
Many of the city startups are helped by the company and its has taken a leadership role in the startup ecosystem, becoming active supporters of events such as Startup Weekend, among others. 
In Cali, the country's third largest city, large development companies comprise much of the tech ecosystem. 
The government is working to promote activities in other cities, but the high-end spectrum of the Colombian economy in general is limited to a few cities. 
Expanding the tech scene, in that sense, may be as much a question of broader development as anything else. 
Colombia has plenty of work ahead if it wants to assert itself as a legitimate global player. 
Looking at the bigger picture, though, Colombia does have a number of advantages on that front. 
This year, Colombia's GDP has grown faster than any in Latin America -- it's currently the fourth fastest growing in the world -- and inflation, though up from 2013, remains low. 
Poverty, extreme poverty, and unemployment are all down thanks in part to tech-based programs designed to address inequality, and labor formalization is up. 
Brazil, once the darling of global experts, has become mired in economic stagnation. 
Argentina and Venezuela are approaching crisis conditions, and immigration to the United States is prohibitively difficult. 
The third-largest Spanish-speaking country in the world, Colombia is essentially fighting for prevalence with Mexico. 
Unlike Chile, another well-developed country, Mexico has even better relative location to the States than Colombia, but it has an image problem relating to escalating drug violence. 
By contrast, Colombia is moving toward an end to its 50-year armed conflict. 
At the end of the day, people just want to be here, says Puscar. 
That might sound trivial, but when you're talking about doing business, it really matters. 
It's a great place to live, a great place to visit. 
The question then is building on what's already here and letting people know how much opportunity there is. 
As the days get shorter with less sunlight, our wardrobes often shift to darker colors. 
Our moods often get a bit darker. 
Cheer up a bit and wear bright colors instead of the typical grays and blacks. 
The Freelancers Union has some suggestions on ways to bring more light into your day. 
You can start with your wardrobe. 
This very morning, a friend's coral T-shirt caught my eye. 
When I complimented it, she said she's wearing fun colors to combat all the lame weather. 
How brilliant is that? 
People, you are not obligated to limit your color palette to the current season. 
Scientifically, bright colors are known to improve moods. 
Unscientifically, I'm always thrilled to see orange polka dots instead of another beige sweater. 
We 've talked about how color influences mood before, so skipping dark colors in your wardrobe isn't a huge stretch. 
This tip isn't a cure for the seasonal affective disorder. 
It's a simple and easy way to beat the monotony of the season. 
Late Friday and early Saturday, reports emerged that the grand jury was still in session and had not reached a decision. 
But after midday, several media outlets began reporting that an announcement won't come until after the jurors reconvene Monday. 
The family of Michael Brown is asking people to wear yellow shirts and act as peacekeepers should any demonstrations threaten to escalate into violence. 
The slain man's father, Michael Brown, Sr., spend part of Saturday handing out free Thanksgiving turkeys to needy families, carrying them past a memorial erected on the street where his son died on Aug. 9. 
One day ago, the jury's decision seemed imminent. 
St. Louis County officials touched off a wave of media speculation Friday afternoon when they began planning a news conference. 
But that notice was only an explanation of the county's plan ; it never included a date or time for the announcement. 
Vice also says gun store owners in the St. Louis area are hiring private military contractors to guard the movement of their stores' wares as they remove them. 
The site adds, more than 300 private military contractors ... have been contracted for work in direct response to Ferguson security concerns. 
The protests have not caused death or widespread destruction, the newspaper says in its by the numbers accounting. 
They have sparked conversations about inequality and structural racism, and forced concessions that the region's criminal justice system is broken. 
While the timing of the grand jury announcement has been the topic of much speculation, school officials have requested that the news not come out during school hours. 
At least one local school district near Ferguson has decided to extend next week's Thanksgiving holiday to Monday and Tuesday ; other schools say they might cut classes short if the jury's decision comes out while they're in session. 
The grid fins are the small waffle-shaped wings you see on the Falcon 9 above. 
They give the rocket an aerodynamic surface that can be used to control the vehicle during its reentry into the atmosphere, and steer it into the right position to relight its main engine, and land on target. 
They're also retractable, so don't add significant drag to the rocket while it's serving its primary function of getting stuff into space. 
In a later tweet, Musk said that the width is 300ft by 100ft, with extra wings that extend the width to 170ft. 
Combined with technology to keep the platform stable, that should provide a good landing platform for the rockets, whilst also being a long, long way away from other people in case things don't go quite to plan.

As Greg Kumparak noted in the TechCrunch review of the Nexus 6, the phone is very large. 
Too large, in fact, for most humans. 
Back when it was just a rumor that Google would be picking Motorola to provide the Nexus 6 hardware, and that it would indeed be a monster with a 6-inch display, I lamented the phabletization of the Nexus line before it was even a real thing. 
Now, I 've had some time with the device, and while part of me still feels the same, another part has to acknowledge that Google may have gotten it right with a go big or go home strategy for this generation of hardware. 
For me, and for just about any other everyday user of the Nexus 6, there's no question that something more akin to the Nexus 5, albeit with just better battery life, a better camera, improved specs and an updated display would 've been the preferable option. 
Not least because such an unexciting iteration would probably have been able to keep the cost down, meaning you'd have another great pure Android option at a fraction of the cost of most locked, contract-only devices. 
Which is great, insofar as you consider the purpose of the Nexus program to build affordable, easy-to-access devices with ergonomics aimed at suiting the needs of the greatest number of people. 
Nexus is not a populist program, however -- it's a reference hardware initiative that Google undertook because it wanted to help show OEMs how to get the most out of Android, and because it wanted developers to be able to build for a specific set of criteria that would mostly serve them well when their apps appeared on other Android devices, too. 
Some speculate that the Nexus 6 was actually just one of many devices that were supposed to take part in the Android Silver program, which would 've replaced Nexus devices with hardware from various OEMs that contained a pure version of Android with guaranteed timely updates. 
That theory suggests that the Nexus 6 is but one of a variety of different kinds of smartphones, some of which would 've resembled the Nexus 5 more closely, and theoretically been more broadly-aimed devices. 
Even leaving that aside, however, the Nexus 6 seems like it fits the Nexus mould -- it's a device that lets Google show off Android 5.0 on hardware that exemplifies some of its best aspects. 
It also potentially anticipates a future where, rather than a mobile market divided among tablets and smartphones, most consumers prefer a single device with a large display but with all the functions they 've come to expect in a phone. 
In my time testing the Nexus 6, it went from something that I found awkward to use and that would mostly stay home, to a device I'd carry in lieu of a tablet, stowed in a pocket or bag, and that I automatically used two-handed, without thinking about how inconvenient it was to use single-handed. 
And while it still isn't for everyone, it might be the Nexus Android needs, in terms of lighting the path forward for what's coming next in the mobile device market. 
Winter has officially arrived just look at Buffalo which means it's once again time to battle through streets clogged legions of holiday shoppers wielding eye-poking, rain-dribbling umbrellas. 
But one man believes he has found the perfect solution to staying dry in the wet: fancy pants. 
Dan Bransfield's case against umbrellas is a surprisingly strong one. 
They're laughably ineffective, obtrusive, messy, and unreliable. 
But are hyper-hydrophobic leggings and a smug sense of self-satisfaction really the best defense against Winter's fury?

Major speculation ahead, but a Star Wars fansite is claiming that this GIF of the Millennium Falcon might be the first-ever bit of footage from the new Star Wars: The Force Awakens. 
What do you think? 
The GIF was originally spotted and uploaded at Making Star Wars. 
There are no details on where it came from, or how they got it. 
All they are implying is that this could be a cut from the much whispered-about Star Wars: The Force Awakens teaser trailer that has been rumored to premiere sometime before the end of the year. 
In fact Slashfilm is now reporting from good sources that the teaser trailer will be shown in a limited number of theaters during the Thanksgiving Holiday weekend. 
WHAAAAAAT! 
But until then, we must speculate. 
The appearance of this GIF online coincides with the rumor from Badass Digest that the first Star Wars: Episode 7 teaser trailer would end with the Millennium Falcon firing blasters, coming right at the camera. 
And that is exactly what this GIF is. 
Then again, a GIF like this would be very easy to fake. 
The lens flare feels almost too obvious and the CG looks a little meh, so we're leaning towards no, but it would be cool if it was the real deal. 
Then again, again, as Making Star Wars points out, the creators of this mysterious footage did get the radar dish right. 
So these people know their shit. 
And we can't really judge FX on a tiny little GIF that we 've stretched out original GIF here. 
For comparison purposes, here is a tweet of the Falcon model used in the movie, which is admittedly much more detailed than this GIF. 
And you 've all seen the official release of J.J. Abrams' version of the Falcon in a video so beautiful it will make you cry. 
So make with the speculating people, we want to know. 
Real or fake? 
What do you think?

In mid-October, HBO dropped a bombshell -- albeit a long-rumored one -- with the news that it would launch a standalone streaming service some time in 2015. 
The media and Game of Thrones fans everywhere immediately went into overdrive, analyzing every last one of the scarce details to death What content will be included? 
How much will it cost? 
Should I cancel my Netflix subscription ?!! 
. 
Naturally, there were plenty of pundits and industry watchers who were quick to declare this latest development the beginning of the end of cable TV as we know it. 
And while only time will tell exactly how disruptive these services will be, I think it's premature to sound the death knell. 
In fact, I see this as far from a catastrophe for cable ; it's a natural next step. 
Over the last several years, we 've seen companies like Netflix and Aereo start to chip away at the traditional cable model, leading to incremental change across the industry. 
These latest developments are a clear indicator that the pace of change is about to drastically speed up, and what was once a slow-moving evolution is getting a shot in the arm. 
Here's a look what some of the ripple effects will be 
Contrary to prevailing wisdom, there's some compelling evidence to suggest that HBO and CBS's streaming services might actually be a boon for pay TV. 
As Will Richmond of VideoNuze recently articulated, the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of traditional cable bundles could very well become more attractive to consumers in the face of proliferating streaming services whose fees will start to add up. 
What's more, this could help pave the way for the virtual pay TV services from the likes of Verizon and DISH by helping to raise awareness of other over-the-top OTT offerings. 
Rather than a binary future with cord-cutters on one end and cable subscribers on the other, we can start to see a continuum of behavior take shape, with a middle ground populated by individuals who subscribe to one or two streaming services, along with a lightweight cable package like the one that Comcast rolled out last year. 
Until now, content providers like HBO and CBS haven't had to give much thought to net neutrality because the Internet wasn't their primary mode of distribution. 
Now, however, they have a vested interest in ensuring that their streaming content reaches consumers quickly and smoothly and will likely pressure companies like Comcast and Time Warner to treat all network traffic equally. 
By now most of us are familiar with Reed Hastings assertion that Netflix's goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us. 
Now, finally, HBO has taken a huge step down the path that leads in Netflix's direction, raising the question of what they 'll do to remain competitive, particularly when most would agree that HBO has the far superior content library. 
One potential scenario is for Netflix to seek out partnerships with cable providers. 
Their content is already distributed via traditional cable packages overseas and to subscribers in some very small markets in the US, so now may be the time for them to start forging deals with the bigger players in order to straddle both worlds. 
And indeed, they struck a small limited-run deal with Verizon FiOS late last month. 
Only time will tell how exactly these new streaming services will affect the TV landscape, but there can be little doubt that there are indeed major changes on the way. 
Even if HBO's offering isn't a success, which I highly doubt, the mere announcement has caught the attention and imagination of every other content provider, each of whom undoubtedly has an OTT blueprint in some stage of development tucked in their back pocket. 
A couple days ago, you might 've come across this video of a guy on a bike doing an awesome loop-the-loop for a slightly cringe-worthy promo for Microsoft's Cortana. 
BUt before he was shilling for #Brands, Danny Macaskill was making far better videos with his friends, and setting them to Band of Horses' breakthrough single, The Funeral. 
Band of Horses are a Seattle rock band formed by indie rocker Ben Bridwell a decade ago. 
These days, they're relatively well known or, at least, as well known as an ` indie' band can be. 
But before they were hipster-big, the band's first single was The Funeral, the soulful and open-to-interpretation story of an unsuccessful battle against depression. 
But it's also makes an excellent backdrop to Macaskill's video, the raw sound and amateur video counteracting pretty well with the epic skills on display.

It took Tim Robbins twenty years to dig his way to freedom through solid concrete ; and this year marks the 20th anniversary of The Shawshank Redemption. 
That gives you a good reason to re-watch possibly the greatest movie of all time. 
But heck, you really don't need a reason. 
I 've probably seen Shawshank five times by this point once by myself, and the four subsequent with each uncultured girlfriend, and each time I swear it gets better. 
Mofrgan Freeman's performance is nothing short of legendary, Robbins is emotional without being overblown, and the warden is the perfect villain.

Not every app has a Settings menu that's easily accessible. 
Sometimes, developers hide away debug menus, secret settings, and more. 
With them, you can unlock additional features or just get some crazy stats. 
Let's take a look at some of the most useful among them. 
Android: Facebook in famously forced its users to switch to the standalone Messenger app. 
What you might not have heard is the functionality is still there in the main Facebook app. 
Facebook Chat Re-Enabler switches it back on. 
iOS/Android: Using the description of a bottle of beer or wine to see if you 'll like it can be hit or miss. 
Next Glass is a new app that uses a huge database of drinks, your tastes, and your smartphone's camera to tell you -- just by scanning the label -- if you 'll love or hate a drink before you buy it. 
iOS/Android soon: Clipping coupons is a great way to save money on groceries, as long as you're willing to put in the time.

Editor's note: Brian Brown advises startups. 
He has raised hundreds of millions in venture capital and been a co-founder in a number of startups, including Joyent. 
Prior to startups, he was deputy editor with the Wall Street Journal Europe. 
Raising venture funding may have just gotten a little tougher. 
A major investor recently announced that venture capitalists are taking on an excessive amount of risk right now -- unprecedented since' 99. 
Marc Andreessen recently said that valuations seemed to be getting warm. 
Add to this the public market jitters, with stocks hitting a two year low last month before bouncing back, and there's a touch of nervousness in the air. 
Given this, it is surprising how startup executives often make a tough task more difficult by ignoring some rules of fundraising. 
Whatever the market, startups should remember the basics, from the earliest contact to the close. 
Venture capitalists like to say that the initial contact is best set up through referrals. 
That's a great rule for those lunching on yachts, but for everyone else, a little hustle can make a difference. 
Referral or not, when you do reach out, do the obvious and make sure that both the investor and her firm are interested in your product area. 
You wouldn't send a biology textbook to a literary agent, so don't send a mobile app to a cleantech firm -- if there are any left. 
In your note, be clear and brief. 
It never ceases to amaze me how fantastically bright people craft verbose and convoluted outreach emails. 
Their long notes to investors who receive hundreds, if not thousands, of pitches are really simple pleas: Reject me. 
The first sentence or two should inform why this deal can't be ignored. 
That's followed by machine-gunned facts, not opinions, which should make it impossible to not want more information. 
Now comes the hard part. 
You need a really good story. 
By story, I mean a narrative that crisply explains in a way that makes your product real, showing not telling why it's needed and why it's going to be big. 
As the entrepreneur Santosh Jayaram told writer Michael Malone: You need to tell stories about your product and how it will be used that are so vivid that your potential stakeholders imagine it already exists ... And few people, he added, have this real talent. 
Malone also noted that Steve Jobs knew this when he explained that Apple's uniqueness derived from this fact: It's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the result that makes our heart sing. 
Injecting that art into the technology is a tall order. 
It is made a little trickier when trying to accomplish it through one of man's most atrocious inventions: the slide deck. 
Most investor pitches, like initial emails, lack clarity and brevity. 
A marketing executive once told me that none of the 72 slides in his investor deck could be cut. 
If you're going beyond 15 slides, then it better be about cold fusion -- on second thought, you could probably get funding for cold fusion with one slide. 
Beyond length, decks often suffer from little organizational structure even as titling and transition slides attempt to camouflage this fact. 
At the very least, make sure you 've covered the basics. 
What is your thing? 
What problem is it solving? 
Explain how it is solving that problem. 
Is it a nice-to-have or a need-to-have? 
Is the market big enough? 
Venture capitalists can only sit on so many boards to get the returns they need for their limited investors. 
If your market is too small, or if you can't get enough of it, you're toast. 
Think in b's not m's. 
And don't give the clichéd comment of if we could just get 1 percent of this market! 
Give a clean and crisp outline of the competition without withholding data and explaining why you are different in the ways that will make your product the obvious choice. 
You must have a good explanation of the business model and how the executive team is well-suited to execute on the entire vision. 
Finally, be careful about running your mouth. 
There are only two types of pitch statements: Those that move the deal forward and those that create objections. 
Talking is not selling. 
With that in mind, be careful whom you invite to the meeting. 
I 've seen plenty of self-important types bloviating on their importance, i.e. chewing up valuable time, irritating investors and creating objections. 
Leave a little time at the end -- your designated timer can kick your foot to shut up -- and ask for concerns or objections. 
Even if the VC is running for the door, nail him down. 
And follow-up, whether they do or not. 
If you really do all that, you may have a shot at raising, even in the unlikely event that another nuclear winter is looming. 
And if there is tighter money ahead, it's probably better to raise earlier, rather than later, if it's an option.

Editor's note: Josh Breinlinger is a venture partner investing in technology startups at Sigma West. 
Josh was the fourth employee at global online freelancer marketplace oDesk, where he was in charge of sales, marketing, product marketing and business development. 
If software is eating the world, then marketplaces are one of the agents of destruction. 
Marketplaces are eating every type of firm on the planet. 
Let's look at where the feasting is happening. 
With the majority of the work going to individual freelancers rather than small agencies around the world, oDesk is killing the traditional outsourcing firm. 
UpCounsel is trying to consume the law firm, especially for small businesses that find the cost of lawyers to be offensive. 
RecruitLoop, which is innovating on the delivery model and providing hourly-based recruiters, is trying to displace the recruiting firm. 
Rev is gobbling translation and transcription firms with fast, affordable, and high-quality service that is beating traditional providers. 
Contently, which is providing high-quality original content, is biting off pieces of PR and marketing firms. 
And yes, AngelList syndicates are trying to kill VC firms. 
Many startups are trying to disrupt the traditional firm structure. 
The biggest driver of adoption is the massive cost savings that these marketplaces provide. 
For example, a marketplace with low fees is a very efficient delivery mechanism. 
Typical markups in law firms or consulting firms might be 4x, e.g. a worker making $ 50 per hour would get billed out at $ 200. 
The same person on a marketplace might raise their rate to $ 75 to compensate for utilization, but the end price to the customer might end up at $ 85 -- $ 95 per hour. 
The simple reason for this cost savings is the reduction in overhead. 
Freelance labor marketplaces don't have middle layers of managers and other support staff, they have independent contractors rather than employees, and they don't have the cost of office space. 
The cost savings are dramatic. 
Turnaround time and quality are also key service attributes that marketplaces are providing. 
Uber is the greatest example of a marketplace delivering a step change improvement in turnaround time. 
With scale, marketplaces have the ability to understand supply and demand and ensure that the right resources are available at the right time. 
All of this can be done automatically in marketplaces versus manually in firms. 
Quality is always difficult to define and measure, but customers know it when they see it. 
Many firms have had decades to refine their internal tools and processes to produce consistently high-quality results, whereas, marketplaces are much earlier in their evolution and are in a building phase. 
Firms today are generally perceived to have higher quality than individuals through marketplaces, but times are changing. 
The constant focus on net promoter score NPS by the top marketplaces will yield marketplace brands that really stand for high quality. 
Shared Reputation. 
The reputation of McKinsey is excellent. 
There's a saying, Nobody has been fired for hiring McKinsey. 
That saying is a result of a very good reputation of the firm built up over many decades. 
It is brand building. 
Until recently, individual reputation was hard to know. 
With LinkedIn plus the five-star feedback system of nearly every marketplace, individual reputation is now well understood and well-curated marketplaces can build a similar reputation for quality. 
Staffing. 
Many times buyers are looking for full teams of people to do work. 
Firms offer an easy way to on-board a large team of people who may know each other, have a preset process for completing tasks, and work well together. 
Marketplaces need to do a better job of handling this issue. 
If you just need a single person, marketplaces do a wonderful job. 
However, most marketplaces don't work as well as you try to scale up to a team. 
Marketplaces face two new challenges: 1 everyone is working independently and 2 availability is frequently unknown. 
Guaranteed Quality. 
The guaranteed quality is a big benefit of turning to well-established firms. 
Buyers know that firms will stand by their work. 
In completely open marketplaces, quality is at the control of the buyer who makes the hiring decision. 
However, in many new marketplaces, there is a much higher degree of vetting and curating of the suppliers. 
Therefore, the marketplace is guaranteeing the quality, much in the same manner that a firm would. 
It's becoming a key part of the marketplace brand. 
And given the ever-increasing importance of and ease of tracking of an individual's reputation, marketplace participants also aim to guarantee quality in order to further their good reputation. 
Whether individual marketplaces are successful or not, the writing is on the wall that agencies and firms of any kind are in a precarious position. 
I believe the top firms in any industry will continue to thrive for decades to come, but there will be an overall shrinking of the bottom and middle tiers of firms as they yield to well-run marketplaces. 
Marion Barry, the fiery Washington, D.C., politician who was famously re-elected after going to jail for crack cocaine possession, has died after months of battling health issues. 
He was 78. 
Barry collapsed Saturday and was taken to United Medical Center in Washington, D.C., where he died. 
He had just been released earlier from Howard University Hospital, where he had been admitted on Thursday, according to WUSA9. 
The cause of death is unknown. 
Barry struggled with diabetes, a blood infection and was a prostate cancer survivor, reports WTOP. 
He had a liver transplant in 2009. 
Barry won three terms as mayor, then spiraled into decline because of drug and alcohol abuse. 
After serving a prison term, he ran a fourth time for mayor in 1994 and won. 
The invisible world of the bathroom isn't pretty -- unless you're a microbe. 
After scanning the microbial zoo of four public restrooms recently, a team of researchers found a diverse swarm of characters that persisted for months despite regular cleaning of the facilities. 
They checked two women's restrooms and two men's restrooms a high-traffic and a low-traffic bathroom for each gender. 
The bathrooms were thoroughly cleaned at the study's start with bleach solution, which killed any existing germ communities. 
Then, during the following hours, days, weeks and months of human use, the researchers periodically swabbed soap dispensers, floors and toilet seats in all four restrooms for microbe samples. 
Because some microscopic organisms won't grow in petri dishes especially those evolved for life in the human gut, the researchers used genetic sequencing technology to get a more comprehensive roll call. 
Within one hour of sterilization, the bathrooms were completely recolonized with microbes -- just as plants rapidly arrive and populate a newly emerged island. 
Fecal bacteria dominated, including on toilet seats and on soap dispensers -- about 45 percent of the bacteria there were of fecal origin. 
In all, the scientists found genetic traces of more than 77,000 distinct types of bacteria and viruses. 
At least some of those species were likely dead or dormant, the scientists add ; genetic testing detects them all, whatever their status. 
They are true survivors, says Jack Gilbert, a microbial ecologist at Argonne National Laboratory, and coauthor of the new study. 
Even after some of the bathrooms were closed, these human-generated communities of microbes continued to thrive. 
Staph's persistence in these studies points to its power as a potential pathogen, Gilbert says. 
Various versions are common on human skin and inside the nose and other orifices ; they generally cause no problems, or trigger only minor skin infections. 
But staph infections can be serious, or even kill, if the bacteria get into bloodstream, joints, bones, lungs or heart. 
And one version of S. aureus bacteria that is resistant to common antibiotics -- MRSA -- can be very dangerous. 
Gilbert notes that none of the live Staph strains detected in the San Diego bathrooms showed signs of being antibiotic resistant. 
They were instead relatively harmless skin bugs that happened to have lost their skin, he says. 
The team did find genes from MRSA hiding on the floor, as well as traces of some troublemaker viruses, including HPV and herpes virus. 
No need to be scared or grossed out by that finding, Gilbert says. 
He actually finds it a little reassuring. 
You just have to think about it in ecological terms. 
All human environments contain pathogens -- your bedroom, the phone you're talking on, even the bugs inside of you could turn pathogenic at any time, Gilbert tells Shots. 
But we desperately need them in our lives. 
Having a healthy community of good -- or even just neutral -- microbes can crowd out the bad ones. 
As we 've learned from using broad-spectrum antibiotics in the human body, sterilization is not necessarily good, he says. 
Bacteria come back right away, and they might come back perturbed. 
Maybe a restroom is an ideal place to put in a rich, ideal ecosystem. 
Does that mean probiotic cleaning products for your bathroom? 
Companies are already working on that, Gilbert says. 
In the meantime, his take-away from the findings: It's good to have good hygiene. 
Don't lick the bathroom floor. 
People -- young and old -- got all dressed up and staged costumed crawls through the streets. 
In Los Angeles, Chicago and other places around the country, newspapers ran stories of folks wearing elaborate masks and cloth veils. 
Thanksgiving mask balls were held in Cape Girardeau, Mo., Montesano, Wash. and points in between. 
Thousands of folks ran rampant, one syndicated column noted. 
Horns and rattles are worked overtime. 
The throwing of confetti and even flour on pedestrians is an allowable pastime. 
Of course there was the familiar Thanksgiving fare for those who could afford it -- turkey, pork, apples, figs and mince pies. 
But there was also a widespread weirdness that has faded away over the years. 
In fact, so many people participated in masking and making merry back then that, according to a widely distributed item that appeared in the Los Angeles Times of November 21, 1897, Thanksgiving was the busiest time of the year for the manufacturers of and dealers in masks and false faces. 
The fantastical costume parades and the old custom of making and dressing up for amusement on Thanksgiving day keep up from year to year in many parts of the country, so that the quantity of false faces sold at this season is enormous. 
Popular get-ups at the time included heads of parrots and other birds and animals and face-coverings of various colors. 
Masks of prominent men and the foremost political leaders are made by some manufacturers, and large-sized false hands, feet, noses, ears, etc., are also new and amusing, the California newspaper reported. 
Some Americans wore masks that made fun of people of other nations with greatly exaggerated facial peculiarities. 
More refined revelers donned soft, ghostly, painted veils made of gauzy mesh that both disguised, and improved -- according to the wry writer -- a person's appearance. 
Most of the false faces -- crafted from papier mache -- came from Germany. 
But several U.S. companies also got in on the act. 
In New York: Newspapers advertised ` Thanksgiving masks' and ` lithographed character masks' for the tots, The Bowery Boys blog notes. 
These featureless disguises were often sold in candy stores alongside holiday related treats like spiced jelly gums, opera drops, crystallized ginger and tinted hard candies. 
Throughout the city, people wore disguises. 
There were Fausts, Filipinos, Mephistos, Boers, Uncle Sams, John Bulls, Harlequins, bandits, sailors, soldiers in khaki suits, the New York Times observed on Dec. 1, 1899. 
Some masqueraders rode horses ; others straddled bicycles. 
Everyone was generous with pennies and nickels, and the candy stores did a land-office business. 
So many youngsters in New York City dressed as poor people, Thanksgiving Day took on the nickname: Ragamuffin Day. 
Parades of ragamuffins -- sometimes called ` fantastics' because of the costumes -- can be dated at least to 1891, historian Carmen Nigro of the New York Public Library tells NPR. 
Children would dress themselves in rags and oversized, overdone parodies of beggars a la Charlie Chaplin's character ` The Tramp', Carmen writes on the library's blog. 
The ragamuffins would then ask neighbors and adults on the street, ` Anything for Thanksgiving?' 
The usual response would be pennies, an apple, or a piece of candy. 
By 1930, the library blog reports, some New Yorkers were ready to move on. 
School Superintendent William J. O'Shea instructed administrators that modernity is incompatible with the custom of children to masquerade and annoy adults on Thanksgiving day by asking for gifts and money. 
Others kept the tradition alive. 
The Madison Square Club for Boys and Young Men, for instance, put on Ragamuffin Parades in an attempt to bring order to the occasion. 
The 1940 parade, according to the library blog, featured more than 400 children and touted the group's motto: American boys do not beg. 
Ragamuffin Parades continued to be popular into the 1950s but they were eventually overpowered by another burgeoning tradition catapulted into prominence by the 1947 movie Miracle on 34th Street. 
The new symbol of Thanksgiving also showcased people in fantastic masks and costumes and, in addition, hoisted giant character-based balloons. 
It was called Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

In 2008, Lauren Beth Czekala-Chatham traveled with her then-partner from their home in Mississippi to San Francisco, a few months after gay marriage became legal in California. 
They'd been together for about a year and a half before they decided to get married. 
After the ceremony, they went back to Mississippi, where they lived together. 
Then a year later, they decided to split up. 
The state of Mississippi doesn't recognize same-sex marriage, however, so they couldn't get a divorce there. 
Silva says that you would have to live in the state you got married in for at least six months -- or longer in some states. 
Establishing residency means getting utilities and a driver's license in your name. 
It's more than just an address change, says Meaghan Hearn, an attorney who works with Silva in the District. 
You're talking about kids. 
You're talking about owning a house in one state, having kids in school in one state. 
You're already going through a tough time separating from your spouse, and to add this on top of it is another layer of complexity. 
Hearn and Silva have seen quite a few same-sex divorce cases. 
When gay marriage became legal in D.C. on March 3, 2010, Silva says there was a lot of excitement. 
Couples who had been together for years went to the courthouse and got married, and so did couples who had only been together for a few months. 
But the hype wore off quickly, Silva says. 
He's had a lot of divorce cases in which the marriage took place on or near March 3, 2010. 
In Washington, D.C., and a handful of other states, divorce laws are slightly looser. 
The district allows people who were married in D.C. to travel back to the city and file. 
Once a couple can file, a divorce is a divorce. 
People get divorced. 
It's a part of life. 
We don't want it to happen, but it happens, she says. 
If we can get the state to recognize an out-of-state marriage, maybe down the road we can get them to recognize same-sex marriage and allow it in the state. 
Czekala-Chatham lost the initial case, and has appealed the decision. 
She's currently waiting for a new court date. 
Late last week Finnish mobile startup Jolla launched a crowdfunding campaign for a tablet running its open source Sailfish OS, smashing past its initial funding goal of $ 380,000 in a couple of hours. 
It has since pushed past the $ 1 million mark, with around $ 1.18 M now pledged from more than 7,370 backers of the Indiegogo campaign. 
Speaking in an interview with TechCrunch prior to the campaign kicking off Jolla co-founder Marc Dillon was bullish. 
I think we're going to sell out, he said. 
I believe that we will quickly see the small initial targets, we will put up some stretch goals. 
I think that we're going to sell a lot of tablets. 
Well, Dillon certainly wasn't underestimating the appetite for tablet device running open source software. 
Sailfish's trump card is arguably compatibility with Android, meaning devices running the OS are not limited to the sub-set of native Sailfish apps, but can also run Android apps -- greatly expanding the software ecosystem users are able to tap into. 
It's a ` cake and eat' it type approach for a startup whose initial pitch was about building a different kind of mobile device -- i.e. different to the dominant Android platform. 
But given Android's commanding grip on the mobile space, app compatibility is a savvy strategy for a mobile underdog. 
Since passing the $ 1 million funding mark, Jolla has expanded its tablet Indiegogo campaign to two more countries, with Australia and Canada now also able to pledge after a public vote. 
The tablet was already available to buyers in the European Union, plus Norway and Switzerland, and the U.S., China, Hong Kong, India and Russia. 
To celebrate passing the $ 1 million funding mark Jolla has also temporarily cut the price of its extant mobile device, a smartphone, by $ 100 to European buyers purchasing it via its online shop. 
The discount offer -- of $ 249 for the smartphone -- expires on or before next Tuesday. 
The phone went on sale this time last year, kicking off to buyers in Finland. 
New York's MTA is planning a new campaign to encourage courtesy on subways. 
NPR's Rachel Martin gets dos and do n'ts from Jake Dobkin, who writes Gothamist.com's Ask A Native New Yorker column. 
Kristy Rodriguez is sprinting on a treadmill. 
She's wearing dark green shorts, a matching T-shirt, and white sneakers. 
The pace keeps getting faster. 
A lot of people think that we can't do it, she says. 
I don't think the same. 
It doesn't matter, women or male -- they're just like if you can't cut, you can't cut it, she says. 
They don't really care about what gender you are. 
If you can't make it up that hill and save someone's life, there is really no point to you being here. 
And that is really what it's all about. 
What it's all about is determining if women can make it in ground combat. 
Sergeant Rodriguez has deployed twice to Afghanistan as a supply chief. 
She has been in the Marine Corps for eight years. 
Her mission on this day at Camp Lejeune is to complete an initial physical. 
Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh are looking at speed, strength and susceptibility to injury, among other things. 
Rodriguez is one about 100 women taking part in the experiment. 
Somebody thinks that we need to take a harder look at things -- and that's what we're going to do. 
Dober says. 
So as far as what anybody thinks, or what our feelings are, it doesn't matter, Dober says. 
We're going to do this, and we're going to do it smartly, we're going to do it efficiently, we're going to do it scientifically, methodically. 
Then we're going to turn some data in. 
Somebody is going to analyze it. 
Then we're going to do what we're told. 
The Marines will train in North Carolina, then in the Mojave Desert, and at 16,000 feet above sea level in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. 
Results of that training, as well as data collected by the researchers, will be turned over to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel. 
The Pentagon must decide by 2016 whether women can serve in ground combat. 
This experiment isn't just about what women are capable of. 
It's also about whether the Marines have the right standards -- if pull-ups are the best measure of upper body strength, for example -- so the experiment includes training exercises that test strength and shooting accuracy. 
Long hikes with heavy packs will test endurance. 
Rodriguez finishes her 6-mile hike, carrying an 80-pound backpack, a day after her treadmill test. 
She insists the pack doesn't weigh her down. 
For her this training is about having an opportunity, and trying to prove determine she can do it. 
She's not sure what the answer is, yet. 
My worry is not about being able to, she says. 
It's about being as fast as the other guys. 
I know that I can pick you up, that's not a problem. 
But I know that I'm not going to pick you up and run with you as fast as he can. 
What can you do with human waste? 
Besides flushing it? 
That's a question that came to mind when we read about the United Kingdom's first-ever Bio-bus. 
It's a tour bus that runs between the cities of Bristol and Bath. 
The tank is filled with biomethane gas generated from food waste and human excrement. 
In Kenya, for example, the 3.1 million residents of Nairobi generate almost 4 million tons of fecal matter a year, says Ani Vallabhaneni, cofounder of Sanergy. 
The Nairobi-based nonprofit has grabbed multiple global development awards for manufacturing low-cost toilets and also for devising a way to turn waste into a thriving business in the city's slums. 
That's right -- Sanergy made poop a profitable commodity by treating it and turning it into fertilizer, then selling it to farmers throughout East Africa. 
The profits go back to the workers they employ. 
The lack of sanitation in Kenya causes health problems, and that ends up costing the government money, says Vallabhaneni. 
But if we can convert this cost and this environmental liability into something that can actually generate revenue or offset other problems, then that's a win-win. 
Our waste contains a lot of nutrients that our body didn't process. 
So farmers in developing countries often use human waste to fertilize fruits and vegetables. 
Enter the Arborloo. 
In Ethiopia, Catholic Relief Services is discouraging people from defecating in the open and encouraging them to use this simple pit latrine with a concrete slab to squat over. 
The waste falls into the pit. 
The families cover it with soil and ash to mask the smell. 
When the pit is full, they can drop in seeds to grow mango trees. 
The words kitchen and poop don't usually fall in the same sentence. 
But a Netherland-based nonprofit called SNV has been promoting charcoal briquettes made of human waste in Ghana. 
The small pieces can be used as cooking fuel in place of firewood, helping preserve trees in addition to putting poo to good use. 
Electricity is always in high demand. 
But in developing countries, it's often in short supply. 
That's where the pee-powered generator comes in. 
Developed in Nigeria by a group of teenage girls in Lagos, the generator can produce six hours of electricity from roughly a quart of urine. 
The generator, which was first displayed in 2012 at a Maker Fair Africa exhibit, separates hydrogen gas from the pee to generate electricity. 
It's based on the work of an Ohio University scientist named Gerardine Botte. 
According to Botte, poop isn't the only thing that can power a vehicle. 
Her dream: a pee-powered car that could get 60 miles a gallon. 
Waking up during a surgery would be a nightmare, yet that's a regular problem for patients in low-income countries. 
Sketchy power grids mean the lights often go out, and with them, the anesthesia machine. 
In other cases, there are too few oxygen tanks for a surgery, so it's canceled. 
Two decades ago, Dr. Paul Fenton faced those hurdles almost daily while working as an anesthesiologist at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. 
The hospital had plenty of anesthesia machines, each provided by a well-intentioned western charity, but none were practical for his clinic. 
The result was a prototype for the Universal Anesthesia Machine UAM, which delivers anesthesia without oxygen tanks or the need of stable power grid. 
The device sucks regular air from a room using a compressor and turns it into purified oxygen for a patient's lungs. 
The UAM uses electricity when it's available, but if the power goes off, a healthcare worker can run the machine with a hand-powered pump on top. 
At the same time, an electronic display, which tracks the amount of oxygen the patient receives, can switch to a ten-hour backup battery. 
He also wanted the machine to be easy to maintain. 
When parts break in the UAM, replacements can be purchased at a local auto shop. 
Fenton's invention took home the top health prize at the Tech Awards Gala on Nov. 13. 
Hosted by Silicon Valley's Tech Museum of Innovation since 2001, the awards salute ten innovations each year that tackle urgent humanitarian problems. 
Global access to anesthesia definitely falls into that category. 
Nearly 32 million surgeries are performed each year without a proper supply of oxygen and anesthesia. 
The hope is that the UAM will enable more people in the poorest parts of the world to get the surgeries they need. 
Fenton partnered with Gradian Health Systems in 2009 to scale up global distribution. 
So far, 100 have been distributed to 18 countries, providing oxygen for over 30,000 surgeries. 
Sierra Leone is one recipient, and the doctors are grateful. 
There is only one oxygen tank-company in the country -LSB- in the capital of Freetown -RSB- This company often fails to meet demand in the city, while clinics outside of Freetown may lack access completely, says Dr. John Sampson of Johns Hopkins University. 
Sampson is training clinicians, both in Sierra Leone and in the U.S., on how to use UAM during emergency scenarios.

This story originally aired on Sept. 22 on Morning Edition.

The four-term mayor was re-elected after going to jail for crack cocaine possession and was still serving as a D.C. councilman. 
The invisible world of the bathroom isn't pretty -- unless you're a microbe. 
After scanning the microbial zoo of four public restrooms recently, a team of researchers found a diverse swarm of characters that persisted for months despite regular cleaning of the facilities. 
They checked two women's restrooms and two men's restrooms a high-traffic and a low-traffic bathroom for each gender. 
The bathrooms were thoroughly cleaned at the study's start with bleach solution, which killed any existing germ communities. 
Then, during the following hours, days, weeks and months of human use, the researchers periodically swabbed soap dispensers, floors and toilet seats in all four restrooms for microbe samples. 
Because some microscopic organisms won't grow in petri dishes especially those evolved for life in the human gut, the researchers used genetic sequencing technology to get a more comprehensive roll call. 
Within one hour of sterilization, the bathrooms were completely recolonized with microbes -- just as plants rapidly arrive and populate a newly emerged island. 
Fecal bacteria dominated, including on toilet seats and on soap dispensers -- about 45 percent of the bacteria there were of fecal origin. 
In all, the scientists found genetic traces of more than 77,000 distinct types of bacteria and viruses. 
At least some of those species were likely dead or dormant, the scientists add ; genetic testing detects them all, whatever their status. 
They are true survivors, says Jack Gilbert, a microbial ecologist at Argonne National Laboratory, and coauthor of the new study. 
Even after some of the bathrooms were closed, these human-generated communities of microbes continued to thrive. 
Staph's persistence in these studies points to its power as a potential pathogen, Gilbert says. 
Various versions are common on human skin and inside the nose and other orifices ; they generally cause no problems, or trigger only minor skin infections. 
But staph infections can be serious, or even kill, if the bacteria get into bloodstream, joints, bones, lungs or heart. 
And one version of S. aureus bacteria that is resistant to common antibiotics -- MRSA -- can be very dangerous. 
Gilbert notes that none of the live Staph strains detected in the San Diego bathrooms showed signs of being antibiotic resistant. 
They were instead relatively harmless skin bugs that happened to have lost their skin, he says. 
The team did find genes from MRSA hiding on the floor, as well as traces of some troublemaker viruses, including HPV and herpes virus. 
No need to be scared or grossed out by that finding, Gilbert says. 
He actually finds it a little reassuring. 
You just have to think about it in ecological terms. 
All human environments contain pathogens -- your bedroom, the phone you're talking on, even the bugs inside of you could turn pathogenic at any time, Gilbert tells Shots. 
But we desperately need them in our lives. 
Having a healthy community of good -- or even just neutral -- microbes can crowd out the bad ones. 
As we 've learned from using broad-spectrum antibiotics in the human body, sterilization is not necessarily good, he says. 
Bacteria come back right away, and they might come back perturbed. 
Maybe a restroom is an ideal place to put in a rich, ideal ecosystem. 
Does that mean probiotic cleaning products for your bathroom? 
Companies are already working on that, Gilbert says. 
In the meantime, his take-away from the findings: It's good to have good hygiene. 
Don't lick the bathroom floor. 
The IP-matching measure will be included in the government's forthcoming Anti-Terrorism and Security Bill. 
This follows another failed attempt by the government last year to push through a so-called ` Snoopers' Charter' -- aka the Communications Data Bill. 
However they are evidently comfortable with IP-matching -- describing the measure today as good news. 
The Lib Dems also supported emergency data retention legislation -- requiring Internet and phone companies to keep records of customer metadata -- which was pushed through Parliament by the U.K. government this July, after the European Court of Justice struck down European data retention powers on the grounds that they were too broad. 
That Data Retention and Investigation Powers Bill aka DRIP was criticized for being overly broad, vague and Draconian. 
It was also rushed through Parliament without proper scrutiny, despite the ECJ ruling being handed down months earlier, in April -- leading to accusations of a ` surveillance stitch-up'. 
But added that, in her view, this requirement does not go far enough -- arguing that police need the ability to retain communications data that was set out in the Communications Data bill. 
So again the U.K. government continues to drive a state digital surveillance agenda that's among the most Draconian in Europe. 
The Home Office claims IP-matching will help police and security services identify terror suspects and organized criminals who are using the Internet to communicate. 
It is also talking this up as a way to help identify other types of Internet users -- including hackers, cyber bullies and even vulnerable individuals using social media to discuss taking their own life. 
That latter scenario is a rather odd inclusion, given the Conservative Party's usual allergic reaction to anything that can be perceived as ` nanny state-ish'. 
Beyond that sort of function creep, there is a huge can of worms being unboxed here, given the logical fallacy of equating an IP address with an individual. 
Politicians failing to grasp the intricacies of technology is, however, nothing new. 
Aerial drone videos, for better or worse, are here to stay, but it's difficult to be too upset about this filming technique's unchecked adoption when it captures video like this. 
Dutch filmmakers Jelte Keur and Reinout van Schie filmed the tallest church in the Netherlands, and the results are breathtaking. 
Filmed with a DJI Phantom 2, the almost two-minute video wasn't the result of some lazy afternoon with nothing better to do. 
Keur and van Schie had to wait 10 months for the perfect cloudy conditions to surround the Dom Tower of Utrecht. 
Although the video suggests that the 700-year-old church is a cloud-piercing skyscraper, it's really only 370 feet tall. 
But where it fails in feet it more than makes up in visual splendor.

As the AP reports, the tree was put up by the city in a public space and the complaints started immediately. 
The tree was missing tons of branches and it had unseemly shape. 
Now a group led by the city council president is raising money to buy and decorate a more impressive replacement. 
The current tree is topped with a lighted pretzel, a nod to the area's many bakeries.

Smartwatches enter a wearable realm that have long been dominated by luxury brands like Omega, Mondaine, Swatch, and Armani. 
It's these same brands that are also none to pleased about their own designs slowly spreading throughout the internet and onto our smartwatches. 
According to TorrentFreak, several watchmakers are beginning to send cease and desist notices to sites posting free downloads that are essentially digital ripoffs of copyrighted watch designs. 
A lot of this attention is focused on round smartwatches like the round Moto 360 and now the LG G Watch R, which can sport any round watchface imaginable. 
Of course, the benefits are obvious. 
A watchface that would normally cost you several thousand dollars to brandish on your wrist is now suddenly free. 
Although the overall visual aesthetic of smartwatches can still be comfortably described as bulky and awkward, for many companies this is just the first generation of hardware. 
Smartwatches will get better, probably pretty quickly, and watch brands definitely should be worried about that. 
Watchface site FaceRepo spoke with TorrentFreak about the growing number of infringement notices and says that they 've been complying accordingly. 
They 've also set watch brand names as keyword filters to help prevent possible infringement before its even uploaded, but as we 've seen with almost every other industry that's been exposed to online piracy, it's impossible to scrub the internet clean. 
Watches have gone digital, and as always, piracy soon follows.

It's a Friday night, and I am on the prowl. 
I'm with my friend Edgar, and we are looking for evidence of the increasing S&M problem among the denizens of America's startup capital. 
We all know the story the past few months: it's really bad right now, but don't worry, everything will get better in time. 
But it is not getting better, and it's time to call out our collective dirty little secret. 
For years, subscription-based pricing popularized by Software-as-a-Service SaaS startups has been pitched to us as a way of reducing S&M costs. 
Traditionally, software was sold as a license along with a maintenance contract that ensured deep upfront revenues and a continuous stream of income. 
Unlike the complexity of that on-premise implemented and managed software, SaaS was supposed to be simpler for customers to use and pay for. 
That simplicity not only saves on maintenance costs for overburdened IT departments, but also theoretically lowers the sales touch required for a sale, generating revenue efficiency for the provider. 
By pricing software as a subscription, startups forego upfront revenue from a license fee in exchange for higher and more reliable renewable revenue. 
The evidence is strikingly poor for the subscription model when it comes to actual dollars and cents. 
My friend and wingman Edgar, the SEC filings database, has all the proof. 
Just take a look at some of the recent technology IPO filings from the past few months to get a hint of the problem. 
Hortonworks, the Hadoop provider, filed its S -- 1 with the SEC last week, and the losses are mounting. 
The company made $ 33.4 million in total revenue in the first three quarters of 2014, but its S&M costs were $ 44.6 million in the same period. 
New Relic, the SaaS application monitoring startup, announced its IPO earlier this month as well, and its earnings record is similar. 
The company had revenues of $ 63 million in the year before March 31, with $ 58 million in sales and marketing costs. 
These high ratios between revenues and sales and marketing expenses are certainly not new for companies heading to the public markets. 
When I criticized Box and Square back in May, one component of that analysis was the companies' high costs to sell a product to their customers. 
Box in particular had $ 124 million in revenue in the year ending January 31, but $ 171 million in S&M costs. 
Now, I know the standard excuse here is that these subscription companies are growing rapidly and this is all just an investment in the future. 
With subscription pricing, the entire model follows from renewals, with the logic being that once you have acquired a customer, the profit margin will rapidly increase as active sales costs come down. 
The challenge is that low-touch sales never seem to be low cost. 
If a customer is shelling out a serious amount of money from its IT budget to pay for a service, there is going to have to be constant attention paid to that customer to ensure that they are happy with the service while ensuring that they don't defect to a competitor. 
This goes far beyond a support subscription, which handles the day-to-day maintenance of ensuring performance of the service for the customer. 
The CIO needs to know the provider is listening to their concerns, and that means a sales infrastructure. 
Furthermore, gross margins for SaaS startups in particular are lower than for companies selling traditional software licenses, since these startups don't just sell code, but also have to manage data centers and other infrastructure to maintain the software service. 
With less margin, startups should be more efficient with S&M spending. 
But we don't see companies lowering their S&M costs post-IPO. 
More than a year after its public debut, FireEye, a security platform for enterprises, had S&M costs that almost equaled revenue in its most recent quarter. 
Even a company as massive as SalesForce has arguably not found its marketing scale yet. 
In its most recent quarter, SalesForce's S&M costs represented more than 51% of total revenue, and more than 67% of gross profit. 
While the company is still expanding at a fast clip with year-over-year revenue growth of 28.5%, it seems hard to see the moment when its S&M costs will simply melt away with renewals continuing. 
This is particularly noticeable when we move away from the SaaS IPOs to other technology startups. 
OnDeck, the small business lending startup, announced its IPO a few weeks ago, and its operations appear much more reasonable. 
The company had about $ 107 million in gross revenue and $ 48 million in net revenue in the first nine months of this year, with just $ 21.8 million in sales and marketing expenses. 
Does SaaS still offer a compelling model for some startups? 
Sure, just take a look at Slack. 
Given its innate virality as a social tool in the workforce, it is entirely credible to believe that the company can have an off-the-shelf product with a subscription pricing model and avoid the S&M problems that plague others in the enterprise space. 
But it has an advantage with organic growth that few other B2B startups share. 
It might be time to admit that sales and marketing are crucial to startups from the day they are launched, and find better ways of building up efficient revenues earlier. 
That message needs to be heard particularly by technical founders, who should grapple and become comfortable hiring sales teams much earlier in their startup's growth. 
SaaS is not an excuse to ignore higher-touch sales. 
For in this competitive world, where startups targeting enterprise are competing not just with entrenched players but also other startups, sales matters more than it ever has. 
The winner of these markets is going to be the company that figures out how to get revenue growth without breaking the S&M budget. 
While we may have an addiction to S&M spending as an industry, we also have the tools and know-how to fix it, and it starts by placing product development and sales on an equal level. 
There's no shortage of great Android phones on the market if you're looking to switch, buy your first, or upgrade. 
Even so, there are certainly some phones that stand above others, either because they have great specs, include good software, get fast updates, or are just a joy to use. 
Here are five of them, based on your nominations. 
There are so many things to consider when buying an Android phone. 
Sure, you can run down all the standard specs and features and look for the ones with the highest numbers -- processor speed, number of cores, display size, display resolution, battery capacity, all that stuff -- but high scores doesn't add up to a great phone that's actually comfortable and fun to use day in and day out. 
Earlier in the week, we asked you which Android phones you thought were the best this year. 
It's been a while since we last looked at your favorites, and even then they were a little similar to the year before that. 
Either way, you offered tons of great suggestions, although there were certainly some phones that rose to the top more quickly than others. 
Here's a look at the top five, based on your nominations, in no particular order. 
The HTC One M8 is the successor and update to last year's most popular phone, and it still brings a lot to the table to love. 
The One M8 is largely an improvement on its predecessor in every way, packing a 5 Super LCD3 display that's protected by Corning Gorilla Glass3 and packs 1080px x 1920px resolution, a Qualcomm's 2.3 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor under the hood, a 2600mAh battery, a microSD slot for up to 128GB of expandable storage, 2GB of RAM on-board, and HTC's updaed Ultrapixel cam on the back and a 5 MP camera on the front, 802.11 a/b/g / n/ac wireless, NFC support, Bluetooth 4.0 -- you get the drive. 
Just about everything you would expect in a high end Android phone is under the hood here. 
You can read more specific specs over at GSM Arena. 
The HTC One's all-metal design deserves special mention as well -- even moreso than last year's version, the HTC One M8 starts off with a single block of aluminum and is machines into the chassis for its components, ditching that plastic feel that many Android phones have. 
The HTC One M8 also sports those two large BoomSound speakers in the front, which are some of the most powerful you 'll find on just about any phone. 
From its sound to its build quality to its features, the One M8 is a solid, high end Android phone, one that offers a mostly stock Android experience, with HTC's Sense and BlinkFeed software in the mix, but easy to either use when you want or turn off entirely if you choose. 
THe HTC One M8 is available in all four major US carriers approx $ 250 - $ 200 depending on plan, and on contract and available unlocked $ 650 with no strings attached. 
Those of you who nominated and praised the HTC One M8 highlighted its build quality, for one, explaining that it's one of the sturdiest, most high-end-feeling Android phones you 've ever used. 
A few of you went back and forth on the issue of battery life -- some of you said you wished it were better, others noted that you didn't have a problem getting more than a day or so out of the included non-replacable battery. 
Some of you noted that HTC's QuickCharge technology helps you get a power boost on the go, but you need the proprietary charger for it. 
A few of you lamented that the Lollipop upgrade for it has been delayed, but it's still on the way. 
Others of you noted that it sounds terrific too, thanks to those speakers.

The Moto X may very well have been the device that put Motorola back in the running as a leading Android phone manufacturer, and even though it's no longer a Google company and is now in the hands of Lenovo the original Moto X and the current, 2nd gen Moto X both launched to upbeat reviews and praise. 
It's not a perfect phone, but it brings a lot of high-end features, great customization options, and a pure Android experience to the market at a budget-friendly price that everyone can love. 
The current model of the X packs a 5.2 Super AMOLED display that's protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 at 1080px x 1920px resolution a step up from the original's 4.7, 720px x 1280px display, a 2.5 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, a 2300 mAh battery, 2 GB of RAM, a 13 MP camera on the back and a 2 MP camera on the front. 
The Moto X also sports NFC and Wi-Fi up to and including Wireless AC. 
You can check out the full specs for the current edition at GSM Arena here, and the original Moto X over here. 
Beyond its specs though, the Moto X is well regarded for its battery-saving features, like active notifications, which only lights up the pixels on the screen required to show you a notification instead of waking your whole display, smart features that let the phone know when you're holding it, charging it, or its face down or in your pocket. 
The original Moto X was a modest size, and while the new one is bigger much to the chagrin of some, who preferred the smaller screen size, it's not horribly unwieldy. 
Both models feature voice controls that are personalized to your voice, and make it easy to use the phone to launch apps, get messages, issue commands and reminders, and more while you're on the go, without touching the device. 
The X isn't the only phone that supports those notifications, of course, but it was certainly one of the first. 
If you like personalizing your phone, the X's rubberized, non-slip back is still available in tons of colors, various wood backings, and more. 
The Moto X is host to a number of unique features, and all of them are pretty great. 
The Moto X is available in 16GB and 32GB flavors, and while the original is available on all US carriers, the 2014 model is available on Verizon Wireless, AT&T, US Cellular, and unlocked. 
Starting at $ 100 on contract, and approx $ 500 unlocked. 
It's available running Kit Kat, and Lolipop is coming very soon, according to Motorola. 
Those of you who nominated it full disclosure, I nominated it noted that it may not have the highest-of-the-high end specs, but it's a perfect example of a phone that can not hit the top of the charts but have other features that make it a compelling buy. 
Its near-stock Android experience, voice commands and Moto-exclusive features like Assist and Migrate not to mention the gestures, like shake-to-launch-camera make it a great phone in general, and its bright display, great battery life, and solid build quality are more pluses in its favor. 
You can read more in its nomination thread here. 
We should also note that the Moto G by Motorola also earned a number of nominations, enough that it could have made the top five, but in the interest in variety, we opted to mention it here -- after all the Moto G is an affordable, slightly lower-end version of the X, with a few of the X's flagship features pulled off. 
It has the power where it counts though -- it may not be a super-high-end phone, but it's more than powerful enough to get the job done, and is super affordable, especially for people not interested in contracts. 
Check out its nomination threads here and here. 
The Nexus 5, manufactured by LG, is the previous generation Google Phone -- it may be surpassed by the newley released Nexus 6 by Motorola, but it wasn't the 6 that earned your nominations although the 6 did get a fair number of nominations on its own. 
The Nexus 5 hit the sweet spot for a lot of people, and since Lollipop is already available for it, many of you are already running Google's latest mobile operating system. 
The Nexus 5 packs a 5 4.95 to be exact True HD IPS + display, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 at 1080px x 1920px resolution. 
It has a 2.3 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor under the hood, 2 GB RAM, a 2300 mAh battery, an 8 MP camera on the back, and a 1.3 MP camera on the front. 
Like any other high-end Android phone, it packs NFC, Wireless up to and including Wireless AC, and more. 
You can read more of its specs at GSM Arena here. 
The Nexus 5 may be a little over a year old, but when it launched it got great reviews, and since the Nexus 6 is still relatively new, the 5 is a great and affordable option for people who want a pure Android experience in an unlocked, hackable device. 
I have a Nexus 5, and the screen is big and bright, the camera is solid, and it runs Lollipop smoothly with no issues. 
Its sound is definitely on the weak side with my older Moto X sounding much better, but it's fast, customizable, offers pure Android, and is hackable if you want to get your ROMs on. 
The Nexts 5 is available in 32GB and 64GB flavors, on all of the major US carriers with the sole exception of Verizon Wireless, and unlocked directly from Google. 
On-contract price will vary by carrier, but at this point it's close to $ 100, unlocked you 'll pay $ 349 or $ 399 for the 32GB and 64GB models respectively. 
If you shop secondhand like I did, you can find even deeper bargains. 
Those of you who nominated the Nexus 5 praised it for being a value buy at this stage, offering fast, powerful hardware at a mid-range phone's price, and free of bloatware from carriers. 
Google does support Nexus phones, and while it ships with Kit Kat, upgrading to Lollipop is a simple matter. 
Some of your griped about the N5's battery life, others of you mentioned that it's on the way out now that the N6 is a thing, but more of you praised it for being a great, hackable piece of hardware that still performs strong and is super fast.

The Sony Xperia Z3 is a brilliant Android phone that comes in a couple of sizes. 
The Z3 Compact earned high praise from Gizmodo and from many of you for being an Android powerhouse without being a huge, pocket-bursting phone like we 've seen so many of recently. 
The Z3 Compact features a 4.6 LCD IPS display at 720px x 1280px, a 2600 mAh battery, a 2.5 Ghz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 under the hood, 2 GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, and a whopping 20.7 MP camera on the rear and a 2.2 MP camera on the front. 
That's a lot in a tiny package, especially considering it's getting Lollipop in the near future. 
The larger Z3, which comes in a Z3v variant for Verizon Wireless and a Z3 for everyone else, packs a 5.2 display at 1080px x 1920px, a micro SD card slot for up to 128GB additional storage, 3 GB RAM, the same quad-core processor inside, a 3100 mAh battery, and the same powerful camera on-board. 
Both models pack Wi-Fi up through and including Wireless AC, NFC, and more. 
Check out the Z3 Compact's specs here at GSM Arena, the regular Z3 over here, and the Verizon variant here. 
Considering previous years' roundups have been devoid of Sony phones mostly only because they're difficult to obtain in North America -- especially flagship phones -- the inclusion of the Z3 is a welcome change. 
It's more than worth the slot, too -- the Z3 and its predecessor, the Z2 is a great device. 
The Verizon Wireless variant offers wireless charging and a few design tweaks, but beyond that the differences are minimal. 
The X3's camera really stands out as well, and it offers a speedy, near-stock Android experience that Sony fans have known and loved for years. 
It doesn't hurt that Sony's Xperia line is generally waterproof or at least extremely water-resistant and dust slides right off the chassis. 
The Xperia Z3 is available for T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless Z3v at about $ 200 on contract, and around $ 600 unlocked SIM free. 
The Z3 Compact will set you back $ 530 unlocked to take to your preferred carrier. 
Those of you who nominated the Z3 called out its waterproof, dustproof chassis, the expandable storage which seems to be all too uncommon these days, even the built-in equalizer earned specific praise from at least one of you. 
A few of you mentioend that the Z3 can get a little warm, but almost all of you had good things to say. 
Some of you called out the Compact specifically for offering a great form factor without compromising on the innards or the camera that the Z3 features.

The OnePlus One was designed to be an Android phone with flasgship specs from an independent team. 
Think of it as an Android phone made by and for Android fans, at a rock-bottom, unlocked, and carrier-free price. 
The OnePlus One certainly delivers, and earned incredible praise from our friends at Gizmodo. 
It's the first phone to run CyanogenMod out of the gate, having been built with it in mind, packs a 5.5 LTPS LCD display that's protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and comes in at 1080px x 1920px, a 2.5 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor, 3 GB RAM, a 13 MP camera on the rear with a 5 MP camera on the front, a 3100 mAh battery, and a ton of custom features designed specifically to integrate CyanogenMod with the OnePlus One. 
That's not to say that it doesn't bring the best of Android to the fore either -- CyanogenMod is a killer ROM, and offers more features than you probably get with stock Android, and certainly more than you 'll get with a carrier-specific ROM. 
You can read more about the OnePlus One's hardware over here at GSM Arena. 
The beauty of the OnePlus One is that it's designed to run CyanogenMod, but it's also designed to be tweaked and hacked by its users. 
The phone started as an invite-only kind of thing, and there are still invites floating around before you ask, I don't have any, but the team behind it has moved to a pre-order system where you can get in line to purchase yours and they 'll get to you in turn. 
They process pre-orders in batches though, so it may be a while. 
The device itself is a joy to use, complete with a textured back and tons of pre-built gestures for quick commands like turning on the flash as a flashlight, opening the camera, and more -- not to mention the power of Google Now rolled in as well. 
All in all, it's a well-polished piece of tech that 'll please Android enthusiasts and hardware lovers alike -- as soon as you can get your hands on one. 
The OnePlus One is available in 16GB white and 64GB black versions, at $ 300 and $ 350 -- extremely well priced for such high-end hardware. 
It's GSM-only and comes unlocked, which means you can bring it to T-Mobile or AT&T or any pre-paid carrier or MVNO that rides their network and accepts it and activate it. 
Many of you noted that it may be slowly outpaced by more recent releases, but it's still an amazing device, well crafted with great software, and while the invite-only/batch pre-order scarcity is a pain, it's hard to understate how exciting it is to have a device like this on the market and support it. 
It's customizable, it's well built and well designed, and it's affordable while being completely unlocked. 
You can read more in this glowing nomination thread here. 
This week's honorable mention goes out to the newly released Droid Turbo on Verizon Wireless, which is, in many ways, a supercharged Moto X crossed with a Nexus 6. 
It's a high-end phone, to be sure, packing top-of-the-line specs everywhere from processor to battery life, and a textured nylon back that's well built and well designed. 
Verizon Wireless users should definitely consider it, and those of you who supported its nomination highlighted its battery life, custom gestures, and more. 
Check it out in its nomination thread here. 
The other honorable mention we should highlight goes to a company we're surprised didn't earn more nominations from you, Samsung -- specifically the Galaxy Note 4. 
We were surprised more Samsung devices didn't earn your nominations the Galaxy Note 4 and its predecessor, the Note 3, were the only ones to get nominated at all, but the new Note earned your praise thanks to its 5.7 display, its great daylight and direct-light performance, among other things.

As teasers are wont to do, the brief spot doesn't show much. 
We see some neat gizmos as characters go on some kind of high-tech safari ride and a very, very concerned-looking Chris Pratt. 
The best part of all of this is the slow piano melody playing John Williams' original theme. 
This brief look is just a prelude to the full official trailer, which is expected to air on NBC on Thanksgiving Velociraptors are known to look like six-foot turkeys after all. 
The plot of Jurassic World, which opens June 12, 2015, takes place 22 years after the events of the original film and shows that humanity has a really tough time learning their lesson. 
-LSB- IGN -RSB- 
Oh, Uber. 
Such a great service ... run by such short-sighted, thin-skinned executives. 
Clue: when people criticize you and/or your company, suck it up, take the criticism on board and apologize/adjust if warranted, then shut up and move on. 
Do not muse aloud, even at a quasi-off-the-record party, about forming million-dollar funds to attack and silence your critics. 
Quite aside from the ethics of it all, how did the notion of repairing Uber's tarnished public image by declaring war on journalists ever seem remotely like a good idea to anyone? 
That's like pouring napalm onto a firestorm, or the Streisand Effect squared. 
And then to casually mention this bright idea to a Buzzfeed editor at a party? 
The mind boggles. 
And so a classic Valley soap-opera scandal erupted. 
Won't someone think of the journalists? 
Pass the popcorn, please! 
Ashton Kutcher waded in, and was schooled. 
Pando's Sarah Lacy and Paul Carr, who seem to live for this kind of slugfest1, did their thing. 
Dave Winer, of long-ago RSS fame, unleashed a strange rant in which he attacked the tech press for name-calling, and ... complained at length about Chrome. 
Claims and counterclaims flew about what actually happened at the infamous dinner. 
And Uber CEO Travis Kalanick apologized, but -- 
But let's not dwell overmuch on Uber and journalists. 
They can take care of themselves, and besides, there's so much else to talk about: Uber's shady competitive practices, disregard for customers' expectations of privacy, alleged exploitation of its drivers, sponsorship of police militarization! 
, and its creepy and/or sexist corporate culture, to name a few. 
They recently deleted their infamous Rides of Glory blog post, but fear not, the Wayback Machine still has it. 
Today, though, let's talk a little about Uber and wheelchairs. 
Because this really seems to epitomize Uber's whole corporate culture: 
I mean, wow. 
We're not talking about wasteful bureaucratic pork here ; we are literally just talking about providing data to help disabled people. 
That's something you'd think a company that will soon have raised billions of dollars would be willing, if not eager, to provide. 
But not Uber. 
Uber is a deeply libertarian company that guards its precious data jealously ... even to the point of refusing to provide the government with information that could help the disabled. 
They really seem to be trying hard to prove Peter Thiel correct -- something which I grudgingly admit happens with irritating frequency -- when he called it the most ethically challenged company in Silicon Valley onstage at Disrupt this year. 
I hate the taxi cartels too. 
But the choice between them and Uber-at-its-worst is very much a false dichotomy. 
Don't get me wrong, Uber is not always at its worst ; but when it is, it really seems like all the worst aspects of today's tech industry, amplified beyond the point of parody -- 
Valley culture probably needs to take some of the blame here. 
On one hand, we stress growth at all costs, and then we're shocked, shocked! 
when founders actually take that to heart, even when those costs include things like values and ethics. 
And their astonishing hypergrowth is apparently blinding Uber to the fact that they are developing a fantastically unpleasant corporate reputation -- in an industry where trust actually matters quite a lot. 
On the other, we 've become such a cheerleading echo chamber that successful tech people now expect not just respect but actual adulation, no matter the source of their success, and any hint of criticism seems completely unacceptable. 
Winer actually seems to be suggesting that because the tech industry is So Very Important its titans should be immune to any kind of critical scrutiny. 
In fact that's exactly why such scrutiny is so necessary. 
I don't really care what Emil Michael may have carelessly said at a dinner party, except inasmuch as it reinforces the spreading notion that Uber is a company run by narcissistic sociopaths. 
But I don't believe it actually is, and I don't believe in Internet pile-ons, and I do believe in second chances, so I'm not uninstalling them -- yet. 
But I do hope Uber realize that they don't just have an image problem. 
They seem to have a fundamental problem with their corporate culture, one that will require real and significant changes, not just empty PR fig leaves. 
I hope those are in the pipeline. 
In the interim, I reckon I 'll be riding with Lyft. 
First, there was James Foley. 
Then Steven Sotloff. 
Finally, Abdul Rahman Kassig, also known as Peter Kassig. 
All three were American hostages, brutally murdered by the so-called Islamic State. 
We had no one who updated us. 
Let's put it that way ... no one at all, says Diane Foley, the mother of James Foley, who was infamously killed this August by the group which calls itself the Islamic State. 
I found out that Jim had been beheaded by a journalist who called me crying on the phone. 
That's how I found out, she tells NPR's Rachel Martin. 
No one from State or FBI or the White House reached out to us at all. 
None of them confirmed the authenticity. 
I mean, it was just awful. 
Dane Egli managed hostage situations for the Bush administration during the Iraq War. 
At the worst point, he says he put a poster up to keep track of all the Americans who'd gone missing -- upwards of 50 at one point. 
His story of communication with families painted a different picture than the one Diane Foley experienced. 
The national leadership would get involved and call family members when it was appropriate. 
President Bush, Vice President Cheney, National Security Adviser Dr. Condoleeza Rice, he says. 
There would be occasions when we might put them on the phone. 
They might ask to talk to parents or members of the family. 
Just each case was different. 
There is also the issue of ransoms. 
Diane Foley says her family did at points contemplate collecting and offering a ransom for James' return, which would go against official U.S. policy. 
In other words, engage. 
Maybe even make a half-baked promise, he says. 
Walk right up to the line without crossing it. 
Be it offering them a ransom or a ride on the space shuttle that no longer exists. 
In the trading, horse trading schnookery business, you would try to beat them at their game, he says. 
This threw us off a little bit, those of us that were ex-military that have been in the hostage rescue business, Egli says. 
It sends a message to the families or those who had hostages who were killed. 
` Well, how come we didn't trade or do something for our family members?' 
Diane Foley says she was grateful for the Bergdahl's family reunion. 
And since they had negotiated with the Taliban for his release I was certainly hopeful that they would do a similar thing for the four other Americans being held. 
So I was incredulous when that did not happen. 
Even so, history suggests some room for ambiguity. 
New York Times reporter David Rohde, who was held hostage by the Taliban in 2008 and 2009, says the American government has a long-standing practice when it comes to ransom payments of saying one thing publicly and sometimes doing another. 
The families are in an impossible position, Rohde says. 
They want to do something, but it's actually not in your hands in the end.You're trapped in these massive international geopolitical struggles, he says. 
The cruelest thing about a kidnapping is that it gives the family the false sense that they can, if they just try hard enough, they can save their loved ones, he says. 
But the kind of kidnapping we have today, the groups involved, that's just not true. 
That certainly doesn't mean most families give up. 
In 2012, Marc and Debra Tice's son Austin was taken hostage in Syria while he was working as a freelance journalist. 
They have not heard from his captors but they still believe their son is alive. 
Like Diane Foley, they feel the U.S. government has held them at too far a distance, denying them security clearance to learn more information about their son's situation, if there is any. 
They also say they feel shut out of the current review of hostage policy. 
We haven't been given a role, Debra Tice says. 
Her husband Marc says they have asked to participate but no one from the government has contacted them. 
Upon arrival on scene, officers located the suspect and advised him to raise his hands, police say. 
The suspect did not comply with the officers' orders and reached to his waistband for the gun. 
Shots were fired and the suspect was struck in the torso. 
The suspect turned out to be a 12-year-old boy playing with a replica gun that fires pellets. 
The gun, which was shown to local media at the scene, was missing an orange tip, which is meant to identify a toy gun. 
The boy was taken to Metro Health Medical Center. 
Hospital spokesman Jonah Levin-Rosenblum says he died this morning. 
At briefing after the shooting, a police spokesman said the boy did not confront or threaten the officer. 
In the 911 call obtained by Cleveland.com, an unidentified male says the guy was pointing a gun at everybody in the playground and while it was probably fake it was scaring him. 
As we 've reported on this blog previously, cases like these highlight the issue with replica guns. 
The Center for Public Integrity, for example, has focused some of its reporting on the National Rifle Associations attempts to derail new laws that would demand replica guns be entirely transparent or neon colored. 
One of the main arguments pellet-gun industry representatives put forth was that parts of real guns are now being painted neon colors -- including pink -- and that police would be endangered by confusion. 
Reeves, de Leon's staffer, said opponents organized an effective campaign. 
It seemed that every teenage boy between here and Kentucky was writing to us against this, he said. 
Opponents also argued that the proposal was pre-empted by federal law excluding higher velocity airguns from color requirements. 
They additionally said it could create a false sense of security by implying that BB and pellet guns were entirely safe, when in reality those weapons could be lethal in certain circumstances. 
Editor's note: Jillian Kay Melchior writes for National Review as a Thomas L. Rhodes Fellow for the Franklin Center. 
She is also a senior fellow at the Independent Women's Forum. 
Using the crowd-funding website Indiegogo, he raised more than $ 2,000 in 10 days to provide bandages and QuikClot, a blood coagulant, for Ukrainian soldiers. 
Using Facebook, he found an American friend headed to Kiev who could make the medical purchases in the United States and bring them abroad in a suitcase, avoiding the pricey and unreliable Ukrainian mail system. 
Also through social media, he found contacts in Kiev who would soon be headed east, who could transport the trauma kits to the front line. 
I would say that I am a very minor example in the greater picture, because there are people who are much more involved with raising funds, Tymtchenko tells me by Skype. 
For myself and my friends, we look at what can be the most effective way of saving a life. 
For starters, it's born of stark necessity ; around the time Russia annexed Crimea, Ukraine had only 150,000 troops, down from 700,000 in 1991. 
Ukraine's defense spending in 2013 was only U.S. $ 1.9 billion -- 35 times smaller than Russia's military budget. 
And even that doesn't tell the whole story. 
Ukraine's former president Viktor Yanukovych, a Kremlin puppet who fled to Russia in the wake of the Maidan protests last February, spent his time in office weakening the military, diverting funding from foreign-focused troops to his own internal police, who helped suppress the Ukrainian people. 
Second, Ukraine's crowd-sourced war effort is decidedly techy. 
A primarily grassroots effort, volunteers and fund-raisers publicize and coordinate their efforts on social media. 
To collect money, fund-raising campaigns rely on everything from Western crowd-funding websites to text-message campaigns to electronic terminals created by Ukrainian banks. 
Tymtchenko tells me most contributions to his campaign ranged between U.S. $ 20 and $ 50. 
A $ 100 donation is considered big, he adds. 
That's not surprising, given that Ukraine remains a relatively poor country, with the per capita gross domestic product still only $ 3,867. 
But small donations make a big difference, as one fund-raising campaign launched by the Ukrainian military demonstrated earlier this year. 
By texting 565, Ukrainians could send in a 49-cent donation to help with logistics and military support. 
It brought in an overwhelming U.S. $ 2.3 million in the first five days alone. 
The majority of the crowd-sourced war effort, though, has come from private volunteer organizations, many of which sprung up during the Maidan protests, then shifted focus to support the fight in eastern Ukraine. 
Reporting for National Review in April, I spoke to a Halyna Tanay, 23, who had volunteered to create secret hospitals during the protests, and who already saw those skills as transferrable to the war effort. 
Things the government couldn't do in years, we did in weeks, Tanay told me at the time. 
It just shows that if you want to do something, you can do it. 
... Now we have a real war in East Ukraine, and we don't know what will happen tomorrow. 
There, it's still dangerous. 
That's why we can't relax. 
We are waiting for -LSB- the Russians -RSB- every day, and if -LSB- our troops -RSB- need help, we can help. 
... Of course, war is worse than revolution, but we understand what to do, and we are ready. 
The range of these projects is impressive. 
Ukrainian civilians can't buy military weapons like guns or tanks, so many projects focus on raising funds to provide soldiers with food, helmets, body armor, and warm clothing ; some projects buy armed cars, and rumors even circulate about volunteers who have managed to restore an old cargo plane, proudly presenting it to the military. 
Fund-raising for drones is also an increasingly popular project, albeit an ambitious one. 
Good ones cost between U.S. $ 1,000 and $ 7,000 when equipped with a camera, says Vitalii Moroz, who volunteers with several initiatives, working especially with Patriot Defence. 
Drones are needed for understanding what is happening with an enemy, and it helps to investigative the enemy territories, he tells me. 
The cheaper the drones, the more accidents: The drones may fly away, they don't follow the -LSB- control -RSB- of the operator. 
Crowd-sourcing websites have their pros and cons. 
It's convenient, but some companies, like Kickstarter, require a project's approval. 
Most are foreign, causing potential currency-transfer problems, though a few Ukrainian ones exist. 
Worse, almost all of them charge a service fee that gobbles a precious percentage of the funds raised. 
In Ukraine, the technological solutions for fundraising are not so developed as in the States, Moroz says. 
We don't have some particular platforms to collect money for Ukrainian soldiers, but -LSB- instead, we're -RSB- sending money through -LSB- bank -RSB- terminals to card accounts. 
There are hundreds of volunteers, leaders of the volunteer groups, who post on Facebook the numbers of these accounts, and they encourage people to send money. 
PrivatBank's LiqPay system is especially popular, offering both online payment and in-person money-transfer terminals. 
The fee is also significantly lower than crowd-sourced websites. 
Volunteers also take big risks to get their supplies to the front lines, Levchenko, the reserve trooper, tells me. 
They bring aid to the front, sometimes moving under enemy fire, he says. 
Sometimes they 've been captured as hostages by terrorists and -LSB- the -RSB- Russian regular army. 
For Ukrainians, the volunteer ethic of Maidan was inspiring and empowering -- there's a reason many refer to it as a revolution of dignity. 
The effort to support their defenders is a logical continuation of this fight, which volunteers say they hope restores a flourishing civil society and creates a free, Western-style nation that protects the rights of its citizenry. 
Since the war with Russia is the worst-case scenario, many people do not care about their positions and their work, Moroz says, noting that war volunteerism unites members of the creative class with businessmen and intelligentsia. 
The just do all they can to fight for the independence.

Black Friday Thursday? 
is quickly approaching, and whether you see it as a daylong spend-a-thon or a blight on American consumer culture, the fact remains -- it can be crazy out there. 
Last week, I asked what were some of the craziest Black Friday moments you 've ever witnessed, and wow ... just wow. 
I was able to glean some knowledge and tips from your collective wisdom and lived experiences to help prepared you for the sales-fueled battlefield ahead. 
When I worked at Best Buy we would pass out slips for the laptops about an hour before the store opened. 
As I was walking down the line, the line decided to curl around me and enclose me in the crowd. 
I immediately realized what had happened and tucked the slips and said no more. 
Customers started grabbing me and yanking the slips from my hands. 
Fortunately a taller and wider coworker was already on his way to save me or things could have been crazy. 
My first job was working for Best Buy. 
During my first Black Friday, I had the last two PS3 and Xbox 360. 
A customer ran and cut the line and demanded I give them both to her, I told her no because the customer who was next in line had a ticket for the last two. 
The lady bit my arm so hard, I dropped the two boxes and pretty much destroyed the boxes. 
I didn't have enough time to hunt the woman down on my own, but I had teeth marks for a few days. 
My cousin persuaded me to go to a Best Buy Black Friday sale with him. 
We camped out in line. 
All of a sudden, these two grown men are on the verge of fistfighting -- yelling, trying-to-be-intimidating postures, clenched fists, all of it. 
Why? 
Because one guy claims the other cut him in line. 
GROWN MEN arguing and becoming violent over cutsies, like schoolchildren. 
I was in shock, but everyone else around me was unfazed I assume I was the only one who was experiencing his first Black Friday. 
Working at a Walmart around 2003-2004, our store still closed on Thanksgiving so we had a mob at the door waiting for it to get unlocked. 
The doors opened and we heard the footsteps running at us, I ducked in the HBA Health and Beauty department and waited for the mob to pass. 
As I was on my way to the electronics department where I worked, I watched a lady hanging around the outside of the mob grabbing all of the limited amount items out of other peoples carts. 
It was pretty genius, she was a like a master thief. 
She took what she needed and walked away with all of the best deals while everyone fought over the Garth Brooks discography. 
Working in retail allows me to see the worst of humanity. 
Two events stick out, and both were over the same product, just different years. 
One was a younger woman who leapt into a bin containing cheap towels. 
I think that they were a dollar, maybe two. 
Once in the bin, she proceeded to whip out a very large knife and slash at anyone who was trying to get one, all while trying to shove the ones that she wanted into a bag or purse. 
During this, she cut a few people, who didn't seem to care and kept digging through the towels. 
The second was an older woman last year who had a taser and was tasing people so that she could get to the towels. 
She was later tased and cuffed by police. 
Other than that, I typically see people crying when we don't have iPods or iPads. 
The best I 've seen was in an electronics store, where a 12 year old or there ` bouts boy was whining to his mom about wanting specific video games -- Crysis, I think -- and mom dutifully kept saying no, which grew into NO, then I SAID NO !!! 
in a very loud, frustrated voice. 
During my first 5 years at Sam's I would walk over to the next door Wal-Mart to buy 2 bikes for charity. 
I would continue to wear my badge for Sam's. 
I did this on purpose. 
I usually got two responses from people. 
The first group were people who saw the badge and thought I was going to get more merchandise out for them to buy. 
They left me alone. 
The second group saw the badge and stopped me for help. 
But here is the thing, and it really let me know that despite all the bad press, the average person is really a decent human being. 
When I told them that I was just there to get two bikes for charity while I was on my lunch break, they helped me. 
They helped me carry the bikes, or they made a space so I could get through. 
Some of these people even let me cut in line so I could get out and get back to work on time. 
So if your asking what is the craziest moment for me on Black Friday? 
Affirmation that, even on the worst shopping day of the year, at the worst time, at the worst store, most people still have decent hearts and the Christmas spirit. 
Western New York can't catch a break. 
First, it was paralyzed by a mountain of lake-effect snow and unseasonably cold weather. 
Now, things are thawing and rain is moving in. 
By Monday, meteorologist say the high temperature could hit 60 degrees. 
As USA Today reports, that could cause some serious flooding. 
The paper adds: 
Weather Channel meteorologist Jon Erdman said rainfall totals of an inch or more are possible in parts of snow-weary Michigan through early Monday, and a half-inch of rain could fall over the heavy western New York snowpack. 
` That's the flip side of the warm-up, dealing with the snow melt and the potential flooding,' he said. 
The National Weather Service has issued a flood warning into Monday afternoon for the Great Lakes region. 
CNN reports that in the worst-hit areas near Buffalo nearly seven feet of snow fell. 
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the network reports, asked New Yorkers to get ready to evacuate at the first sign of a flood, because that melting snow could be dangerous. 
It's a toxic brew, Cuomo said. 
It has sewage in it ; it has runoff in it. 
Warming temperatures forecast for Sunday will start to melt 7 feet of snow that fell last week. 
Rain will add to the menace. 
State officials aren't taking any chances. 
They 've beefed up stockpiles of emergency supplies including generators and pumps and prepared nearly 180,000 sandbags. 
Swift-water rescue teams also are in place, along with helicopters, in case anyone gets caught in a deluge of runoff waters. 
The New York Fire Department sent about 40 members of its incident management team and about 500 National Guardsmen arrived the area. 
AirDrop lets you transfer files between iOS devices with a swipe of your finger. 
It also lets you transfer the files to devices nearby. 
If you don't set it to contacts only,' anyone near you can send files. 
Verge writer Josh Lowensohn used a clever way to warn people about this default setting in iOS 8. 
He sent by Airdrop pictures of sloths wearing spacesuits to commuters on a train in San Francisco. 
When others around him received the request to send a file, curiosity killed the cat and enabled the sloth. 
His trick was benign and did no damage, but the default settings could put your iPhone or iPad at risk of less benign images. 
Not everything is as pleasant as a sloth in a spacesuit. 
Fitness marketplace Fitmob is growing fast and looking to grow even faster, and to do so it's raised new strategic funding from Recruit Strategic Partners. 
The funding will be used as Fitmob adds more options to its fitness marketplace through partnerships with gyms, and as it seeks to expand into new markets. 
Fitmob has refined its business model quite a bit recently, moving from a pure peer-to-peer model to one in which the company partners with existing players in the industry. 
The company also launched $ 99 monthly subscriptions several weeks ago and has seen demand explode since then. 
Over the past several months, the company started partnering with different yoga and other fitness studios to offer up a wider variety of classes to its users. 
And now, in a bit of a twist, the San Francisco-based company has begin working with gyms. 
That marks a shift from Fitmob's original plan to build a peer-to-peer marketplace of activities that sought to connect users with trainers and classes that didn't have to be -- and often weren't -- connected with a gym or training studio. 
By doing so, the company had sought to lower the cost of overhead associated with the current fitness model, while also giving trainers more freedom to make money from classes that they taught. 
Our initial positioning was that we were an alternative to the gym, Kapoor told me by phone. 
But since, he says the company has evolved its business model. 
We decided we were better off partnering with the industry than trying to go around it ... It makes more sense to leverage -LSB- gyms' -RSB- excess capacity than to create all new capacity in the system. 
Gyms that will become available in San Francisco, Marin, and Seattle include Studiomix, World Gym, LiveFit, Kentfield Fitness, Fitness SF, Body Kinetics in Marin, and The Seattle Gym. 
Altogether, there are 17 participating at launch, but the company expects to add more each week. 
By including gyms in its list of activities, Fitmob users can either sign up for their classes or just drop in and use their equipment. 
Like its existing partners, Fitmob will pay also gyms on a per-use or per-visit basis, but it will be doing so at a heavy discount over their usual a la carte prices. 
The goal is to fill up unused capacity at those gyms, according to Kapoor. 
And the model works because about 70 percent of spots in any given class are usually open, which means that any Fitmob user who signs up is taking a spot that probably would have remained empty. 
In addition to adding gyms to its list of fitness options, Fitmob has also just launched an Android app, which should grow its addressable user base. 
That's important, especially as it looks to become available in places besides San Francisco, Seattle, and Marin. 
Today it has about 80 different trainers, studios and gyms on the platform in San Francisco and about 40 in Seattle, with more being added over time. 
But expansion into even more cities is coming soon, with Fitmob looking to launch in the top 50 cities in the U.S. over the next year. 
Now that the company has locked down how it works in its home market and nearby, it plans to enter new cities over the coming months. 
To do so, it hires brand ambassadors in each new market to help it find the best trainers, studios, and gyms and then works to sign them up. 
And of course, the funding will help with that. 
Fitmob isn't disclosing the size of the investment by Recruit Strategic Partners, but Kapoor notes Recruit is the home of some of the largest marketplace in Japan. 
Leveraging its expertise, Fitmob hopes to continue growing its own marketplace right here in the U.S. 
There's no shortage of great Android phones on the market if you're looking to switch, buy your first, or upgrade. 
Even so, there are certainly some phones that stand above others, either because they have great specs, include good software, get fast updates, or are just a joy to use. 
Here are five of them, based on your nominations. 
There are so many things to consider when buying an Android phone. 
Sure, you can run down all the standard specs and features and look for the ones with the highest numbers -- processor speed, number of cores, display size, display resolution, battery capacity, all that stuff -- but high scores doesn't add up to a great phone that's actually comfortable and fun to use day in and day out. 
Earlier in the week, we asked you which Android phones you thought were the best this year. 
It's been a while since we last looked at your favorites, and even then they were a little similar to the year before that. 
Either way, you offered tons of great suggestions, although there were certainly some phones that rose to the top more quickly than others. 
Here's a look at the top five, based on your nominations, in no particular order. 
The HTC One M8 is the successor and update to last year's most popular phone, and it still brings a lot to the table to love. 
The One M8 is largely an improvement on its predecessor in every way, packing a 5 Super LCD3 display that's protected by Corning Gorilla Glass3 and packs 1080px x 1920px resolution, a Qualcomm's 2.3 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor under the hood, a 2600mAh battery, a microSD slot for up to 128GB of expandable storage, 2GB of RAM on-board, and HTC's updaed Ultrapixel cam on the back and a 5 MP camera on the front, 802.11 a/b/g / n/ac wireless, NFC support, Bluetooth 4.0 -- you get the drive. 
Just about everything you would expect in a high end Android phone is under the hood here. 
You can read more specific specs over at GSM Arena. 
The HTC One's all-metal design deserves special mention as well -- even moreso than last year's version, the HTC One M8 starts off with a single block of aluminum and is machines into the chassis for its components, ditching that plastic feel that many Android phones have. 
The HTC One M8 also sports those two large BoomSound speakers in the front, which are some of the most powerful you 'll find on just about any phone. 
From its sound to its build quality to its features, the One M8 is a solid, high end Android phone, one that offers a mostly stock Android experience, with HTC's Sense and BlinkFeed software in the mix, but easy to either use when you want or turn off entirely if you choose. 
THe HTC One M8 is available in all four major US carriers approx $ 250 - $ 200 depending on plan, and on contract and available unlocked $ 650 with no strings attached. 
Those of you who nominated and praised the HTC One M8 highlighted its build quality, for one, explaining that it's one of the sturdiest, most high-end-feeling Android phones you 've ever used. 
A few of you went back and forth on the issue of battery life -- some of you said you wished it were better, others noted that you didn't have a problem getting more than a day or so out of the included non-replacable battery. 
Some of you noted that HTC's QuickCharge technology helps you get a power boost on the go, but you need the proprietary charger for it. 
A few of you lamented that the Lollipop upgrade for it has been delayed, but it's still on the way. 
Others of you noted that it sounds terrific too, thanks to those speakers. 
You can read more of your own nomination praises in the nomination thread here. 
The Moto X may very well have been the device that put Motorola back in the running as a leading Android phone manufacturer, and even though it's no longer a Google company and is now in the hands of Lenovo the original Moto X and the current, 2nd gen Moto X both launched to upbeat reviews and praise. 
It's not a perfect phone, but it brings a lot of high-end features, great customization options, and a pure Android experience to the market at a budget-friendly price that everyone can love. 
The current model of the X packs a 5.2 Super AMOLED display that's protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 at 1080px x 1920px resolution a step up from the original's 4.7, 720px x 1280px display, a 2.5 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, a 2300 mAh battery, 2 GB of RAM, a 13 MP camera on the back and a 2 MP camera on the front. 
The Moto X also sports NFC and Wi-Fi up to and including Wireless AC. 
You can check out the full specs for the current edition at GSM Arena here, and the original Moto X over here. 
Beyond its specs though, the Moto X is well regarded for its battery-saving features, like active notifications, which only lights up the pixels on the screen required to show you a notification instead of waking your whole display, smart features that let the phone know when you're holding it, charging it, or its face down or in your pocket. 
The original Moto X was a modest size, and while the new one is bigger much to the chagrin of some, who preferred the smaller screen size, it's not horribly unwieldy. 
Both models feature voice controls that are personalized to your voice, and make it easy to use the phone to launch apps, get messages, issue commands and reminders, and more while you're on the go, without touching the device. 
The X isn't the only phone that supports those notifications, of course, but it was certainly one of the first. 
If you like personalizing your phone, the X's rubberized, non-slip back is still available in tons of colors, various wood backings, and more. 
The Moto X is host to a number of unique features, and all of them are pretty great. 
The Moto X is available in 16GB and 32GB flavors, and while the original is available on all US carriers, the 2014 model is available on Verizon Wireless, AT&T, US Cellular, and unlocked. 
Starting at $ 100 on contract, and approx $ 500 unlocked. 
It's available running Kit Kat, and Lolipop is coming very soon, according to Motorola. 
Those of you who nominated it full disclosure, I nominated it noted that it may not have the highest-of-the-high end specs, but it's a perfect example of a phone that can not hit the top of the charts but have other features that make it a compelling buy. 
Its near-stock Android experience, voice commands and Moto-exclusive features like Assist and Migrate not to mention the gestures, like shake-to-launch-camera make it a great phone in general, and its bright display, great battery life, and solid build quality are more pluses in its favor. 
You can read more in its nomination thread here. 
We should also note that the Moto G by Motorola also earned a number of nominations, enough that it could have made the top five, but in the interest in variety, we opted to mention it here -- after all the Moto G is an affordable, slightly lower-end version of the X, with a few of the X's flagship features pulled off. 
It has the power where it counts though -- it may not be a super-high-end phone, but it's more than powerful enough to get the job done, and is super affordable, especially for people not interested in contracts. 
Check out its nomination threads here and here. 
The Nexus 5, manufactured by LG, is the previous generation Google Phone -- it may be surpassed by the newley released Nexus 6 by Motorola, but it wasn't the 6 that earned your nominations although the 6 did get a fair number of nominations on its own. 
The Nexus 5 hit the sweet spot for a lot of people, and since Lollipop is already available for it, many of you are already running Google's latest mobile operating system. 
The Nexus 5 packs a 5 4.95 to be exact True HD IPS + display, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 at 1080px x 1920px resolution. 
It has a 2.3 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor under the hood, 2 GB RAM, a 2300 mAh battery, an 8 MP camera on the back, and a 1.3 MP camera on the front. 
Like any other high-end Android phone, it packs NFC, Wireless up to and including Wireless AC, and more. 
You can read more of its specs at GSM Arena here. 
The Nexus 5 may be a little over a year old, but when it launched it got great reviews, and since the Nexus 6 is still relatively new, the 5 is a great and affordable option for people who want a pure Android experience in an unlocked, hackable device. 
I have a Nexus 5, and the screen is big and bright, the camera is solid, and it runs Lollipop smoothly with no issues. 
Its sound is definitely on the weak side with my older Moto X sounding much better, but it's fast, customizable, offers pure Android, and is hackable if you want to get your ROMs on. 
The Nexts 5 is available in 16GB and 32GB flavors, on all of the major US carriers with the sole exception of Verizon Wireless, and unlocked directly from Google. 
On-contract price will vary by carrier, but at this point it's close to $ 100, unlocked you 'll pay $ 349 or $ 399 for the 32GB and 64GB models respectively. 
If you shop secondhand like I did, you can find even deeper bargains. 
Those of you who nominated the Nexus 5 praised it for being a value buy at this stage, offering fast, powerful hardware at a mid-range phone's price, and free of bloatware from carriers. 
Google does support Nexus phones, and while it ships with Kit Kat, upgrading to Lollipop is a simple matter. 
Some of your griped about the N5's battery life, others of you mentioned that it's on the way out now that the N6 is a thing, but more of you praised it for being a great, hackable piece of hardware that still performs strong and is super fast.

The Sony Xperia Z3 is a brilliant Android phone that comes in a couple of sizes. 
The Z3 Compact earned high praise from Gizmodo and from many of you for being an Android powerhouse without being a huge, pocket-bursting phone like we 've seen so many of recently. 
The Z3 Compact features a 4.6 LCD IPS display at 720px x 1280px, a 2600 mAh battery, a 2.5 Ghz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 under the hood, 2 GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, and a whopping 20.7 MP camera on the rear and a 2.2 MP camera on the front. 
That's a lot in a tiny package, especially considering it's getting Lollipop in the near future. 
The larger Z3, which comes in a Z3v variant for Verizon Wireless and a Z3 for everyone else, packs a 5.2 display at 1080px x 1920px, a micro SD card slot for up to 128GB additional storage, 3 GB RAM, the same quad-core processor inside, a 3100 mAh battery, and the same powerful camera on-board. 
Both models pack Wi-Fi up through and including Wireless AC, NFC, and more. 
Check out the Z3 Compact's specs here at GSM Arena, the regular Z3 over here, and the Verizon variant here. 
Considering previous years' roundups have been devoid of Sony phones mostly only because they're difficult to obtain in North America -- especially flagship phones -- the inclusion of the Z3 is a welcome change. 
It's more than worth the slot, too -- the Z3 and its predecessor, the Z2 is a great device. 
The Verizon Wireless variant offers wireless charging and a few design tweaks, but beyond that the differences are minimal. 
The X3's camera really stands out as well, and it offers a speedy, near-stock Android experience that Sony fans have known and loved for years. 
It doesn't hurt that Sony's Xperia line is generally waterproof or at least extremely water-resistant and dust slides right off the chassis. 
The Xperia Z3 is available for T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless Z3v at about $ 200 on contract, and around $ 600 unlocked SIM free. 
The Z3 Compact will set you back $ 530 unlocked to take to your preferred carrier. 
Those of you who nominated the Z3 called out its waterproof, dustproof chassis, the expandable storage which seems to be all too uncommon these days, even the built-in equalizer earned specific praise from at least one of you. 
A few of you mentioend that the Z3 can get a little warm, but almost all of you had good things to say. 
Some of you called out the Compact specifically for offering a great form factor without compromising on the innards or the camera that the Z3 features.

The OnePlus One was designed to be an Android phone with flasgship specs from an independent team. 
Think of it as an Android phone made by and for Android fans, at a rock-bottom, unlocked, and carrier-free price. 
The OnePlus One certainly delivers, and earned incredible praise from our friends at Gizmodo. 
It's the first phone to run CyanogenMod out of the gate, having been built with it in mind, packs a 5.5 LTPS LCD display that's protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and comes in at 1080px x 1920px, a 2.5 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor, 3 GB RAM, a 13 MP camera on the rear with a 5 MP camera on the front, a 3100 mAh battery, and a ton of custom features designed specifically to integrate CyanogenMod with the OnePlus One. 
That's not to say that it doesn't bring the best of Android to the fore either -- CyanogenMod is a killer ROM, and offers more features than you probably get with stock Android, and certainly more than you 'll get with a carrier-specific ROM. 
You can read more about the OnePlus One's hardware over here at GSM Arena. 
The beauty of the OnePlus One is that it's designed to run CyanogenMod, but it's also designed to be tweaked and hacked by its users. 
The phone started as an invite-only kind of thing, and there are still invites floating around before you ask, I don't have any, but the team behind it has moved to a pre-order system where you can get in line to purchase yours and they 'll get to you in turn. 
They process pre-orders in batches though, so it may be a while. 
The device itself is a joy to use, complete with a textured back and tons of pre-built gestures for quick commands like turning on the flash as a flashlight, opening the camera, and more -- not to mention the power of Google Now rolled in as well. 
All in all, it's a well-polished piece of tech that 'll please Android enthusiasts and hardware lovers alike -- as soon as you can get your hands on one. 
The OnePlus One is available in 16GB white and 64GB black versions, at $ 300 and $ 350 -- extremely well priced for such high-end hardware. 
It's GSM-only and comes unlocked, which means you can bring it to T-Mobile or AT&T or any pre-paid carrier or MVNO that rides their network and accepts it and activate it. 
Many of you noted that it may be slowly outpaced by more recent releases, but it's still an amazing device, well crafted with great software, and while the invite-only/batch pre-order scarcity is a pain, it's hard to understate how exciting it is to have a device like this on the market and support it. 
It's customizable, it's well built and well designed, and it's affordable while being completely unlocked. 
You can read more in this glowing nomination thread here. 
This week's honorable mention goes out to the newly released Droid Turbo on Verizon Wireless, which is, in many ways, a supercharged Moto X crossed with a Nexus 6. 
It's a high-end phone, to be sure, packing top-of-the-line specs everywhere from processor to battery life, and a textured nylon back that's well built and well designed. 
Verizon Wireless users should definitely consider it, and those of you who supported its nomination highlighted its battery life, custom gestures, and more. 
Check it out in its nomination thread here. 
The other honorable mention we should highlight goes to a company we're surprised didn't earn more nominations from you, Samsung -- specifically the Galaxy Note 4. 
We were surprised more Samsung devices didn't earn your nominations the Galaxy Note 4 and its predecessor, the Note 3, were the only ones to get nominated at all, but the new Note earned your praise thanks to its 5.7 display, its great daylight and direct-light performance, among other things. 
You can read more about it in its nomination thread here.

Mapping human poo in San Francisco. 
Tracking stinky snails in Florida. 
And coming up with a way to tell men that if they could just learn to close their legs, please, the NYC subway would suck so much less for everyone. 
Be forewarned, it's kind of a gross edition of What's Ruining Our Cities. 
It's a fact of life in most cities that some people use public spaces as public toilets, but San Francisco is facing some kind of epidemic, with turds rolling into streets and sidewalks with alarming frequency. 
Just look at St. George Alley, wedged between North Beach and the Financial District, where city workers currently scoop up 30 piles of poop per week, according to a Department of Public Works employee. 
But which places are the crappiest? 
Since people report their shitty experiences to 311, web developer Jennifer Wong created a quite beautiful map using this public data named Human Wasteland. 
The winning/losing neighborhoods are the Excelsior, SOMA, and the Outer Sunset. 
-LSB- Human Wasteland, SF Weekly -RSB- 
Florida's most unwelcome new residents are giant African land snails, which are currently wreaking havoc on Miami-Dade County. 
The slimy beasts -- which can reach up to eight inches in size! 
-- likely hitched a ride over in an exotic plant shipment and they're pretty much the worst. 
They eat everything, from landscaping to agriculture to HOUSES they use the stucco to build up calcium for their shells, plus they leave behind sticky trails of mucus that smell like rotten eggs. 
Now the bad news, according to an NPR report: They're hermaphrodites, which means they can self-reproduce. 
Shuddddddder. 
But here's the good news: In some African countries, the snails are also seen as delicacies. 
So maybe we 'll see giant escargot on Miami menus soon? 
-LSB- NPR -RSB- 
For years blogs have faithfully documented the scourge of man spreading -- where men spread their legs and belongings far and wide on the New York City subway, taking up far more space than any human should ever require. 
The MTA is now planning a campaign for the new year that will publicly shame these men into closing their legs yes, there are some women who take up too much room, but the offenders are mostly men! 
and acting more respectably on trains. 
The campaign will also target people who don't take off their backpacks also mostly men! 
. 
Perhaps a simple social media campaign encouraging people to photograph and hashtag offenders would suffice?

Back when Code Switch was just a zygote, we spent a day holed up in a teeny room tossing around different names we could call ourselves. 
Many of them never would see the light of day, which was probably -- OK, definitely -- for the better. 
You People was beloved by me, and only me, but never a serious contender because, as my teammates pointed out, could you imagine our hosts saying it on-air? 
Also in the mix: Post-Post-Racial and Minority Report. 
We knew that if all else failed, we could fall back on Earth Tones. 
Not really. 
Some of us lobbied for a name we knew we'd never get away with: CPT. 
For the uninitiated, that's a reference to Colored People's Time, which is the idea that for brown people, late is a synonym for on time. 
We wouldn't have been the first media organization to name a team CPT ; in 1968, Detroit public television station WTVS had a show with that appellation that catered to African-Americans. 
The term was and is polarizing. 
Many people strongly dislike it because it contains an anachronistic term for minorities -- colored people. 
And that phrase has fallen victim to the euphemism treadmill, which CPT's lead blogger, Gene Demby, recently wrote about. 
Also, it stereotypes people of color as always being late. 
I noticed both of these points in a recent episode of The Mindy Project, in which Mindy's chronic tardiness is the main plot. 
She's late for all her social engagements, but never professional ones. 
It's annoying, especially for her boyfriend. 
Here's the exchange: 
Caramel Princess Time. 
Chinese People Time. 
Cute Panda Time. 
So many potential variations! 
Hooray! 
I asked people on Twitter what their alternative phrases to CPT are, and ` lo and behold, they answered pretty quickly: 
It's hard to tell where this concept originated. 
But one of the earliest versions I came across was from a 1914 issue of the Chicago Defender, in a race-manners column penned by D.W. Johnson. 
And he clearly thought that adherents to CPT were, um, rude: 
If almost every community -- Latinos and Irish folks and Indian-Americans and LGBT folks and West Indians and many, many others -- has a cultural norm of not being perfectly on time -- then shouldn't arriving on time be the thing that gets its own special snowflake phrase? 
It seems, from people's responses, that CPT is basically Everyone Standard Time -- that early or punctual arrivers are the exceptions. 
So, what we need is a term that encapsulates this abnormal, prompt behavior -- something that describes a cultural expectation of being on time. 
Maybe something that's catchy, that spans all the various punctual groups.

PricewaterhouseCoopers analysts are predicting again that ebooks could soon edge out print as publishers' most lucrative products. 
What does this mean? 
Essentially that a ebook popularity and pricing stabilizes, users will spend more on bits than they will on pulp. 
The resulting switch could be the final nail in the print coffin. 
Will this happen? 
I'm not betting on the 2018 number. 
First, The Digital Reader points out that PwC has been making this same prediction over and over again, year after year. 
Why? 
Because at some point the will be correct. 
I honestly expected ebooks to overtake print in the US far sooner. 
The numbers still point to print surpassing ebooks with alarming regularity and print is still wildly popular in Europe. 
But this will change as cheaper ereaders become available but there is also a generational issue. 
Kids and older adults -- audiences that bookend the book market -- are still reading print books as the plethora of 50 Shades, Twilight, and Harry Potter titles at second-hand bookshops can attest. 
But as parents become more comfortable with leaving a tablet with the kids as they doze off I feel even the first of these hold-fasts can soon crumble. 
As for older adults this number is chipped away as grandparents and parents become familiar with their kids' Kindles. 
Print books are still commonplace. 
In order for ebooks to win print books have to become cult objects. 
I, a book lover who understands the amazing tools afforded writers by epublishing, recently purchased a copy of Cory Doctorow's new book Information Doesn't Want To Be Free in hardcover. 
I can't remember why I bought it in paper form -- perhaps I wasn't paying attention on Amazon -- but there is something about holding a nicely printed book in my hand, dust cover slipping slightly off the cardboard cover, and the minutes ticking away into hours as I flipped crisp pages. 
But, as an indie author, sooner I can romanticize the experience of ebooks the better. 
We are caught in two worlds and the new one isn't quite ready yet. 
Marc Andreessen has said that there are 15 companies per year that generate 90% of the returns for VCs. 
Startups jockey for position in the Billion Dollar Club. 
In the world of startups we don't have the S&P 500, we have the Unicorn 50. 
Fab was once a member of this unicorn club. 
Founders Jason Goldberg and Bradford Shellhammer appeared on magazine covers. 
The company was a fixture on most innovative lists. 
Fab raised $ 336 million dollars in total funding, including a recent $ 150 million dollar round which valued the company $ 1.5 billion dollars. 
Now, in what can only be called the largest flash sale in history, Fab is reportedly being sold to PCH International for $ 15 million dollars, or just 1% of its former value. 
Stories of outsized success are inspiring, but the disproportionate attention paid to these mythical beasts is detrimental to the broader startup ecosystem. 
This obsession with founding and funding unicorns has driven VC funds to become billion dollar behemoths, and as a result, ignore smaller, though still very promising, companies. 
I call this kind of startup a thoroughbred. 
They're impressive organizations that have the potential to change the lives of their customers and employees, but differ from unicorns in that they are only likely to exit for $ 100-500 million dollars. 
Some VCs see these companies as too small to concern themselves with, but there is something fundamentally broken in the startup ecosystem when funding a company that sells for a quarter billion dollars is an unattractive prospect. 
Personally, founding and selling a thoroughbred company proved to be life-changing. 
In 2003, Eric Paley and I raised $ 8.5 million dollars for our company, Brontes Technologies. 
Our goal was to digitize a part of dentistry that hadn't changed since Egyptian times. 
We developed a hand-held scanner that allowed dentists to create 3-D models of their patient's mouths and 3-D print crowns and fillings. 
We didn't get our faces on the cover of Forbes, instead we spent most of our time on the un glamorous dental trade show circuit. 
In 2006 we sold the company to 3M for $ 95M, generating an excellent return for our investors, and for us. 
In the five years since we started the fund we 've seen a dramatic growth in the number of venture capital funds and the amount of funds they have under management. 
This surplus of dollars means that any attractive category of companies -- think of subscription ecommerce in the wake of BirchBox or daily deals after Groupon -- will quickly have 3-5 venture-funded startups competing for investor dollars, customer attention, and resumes for key hires. 
Each company will raise more money than the previous one and an arms race for everything from Adwords to office space will ensue. 
The problem with trying to attain mythical status is that there can only be one. 
Raising huge amounts of funding locks you into a binary outcome -- you're either worth billions or you go bankrupt. 
First wave web companies were built on the strength of network effects that rewarded companies like Amazon and Ebay with near monopolies. 
This has led many to believe that there's bound to be a single winner in any tech category, but not every market has a winner takes all dynamic. 
Apple and Android co-exist. 
In adtech, dozens of very successful companies deliver solutions to brands and publishers. 
Even in the slow moving dental industry we had a venture-funded competitor that also enjoyed a sizable ~ $ 200M, but non-unicorn exit shortly after ours. 
Not everyone has to be running a unicorn to build a great company, recruit a great team, or to raise capital. 
It's hard to ignore the pundits, but just like in politics or sports, sometimes it's the best thing one can do for their sanity. 
Focus on your customers, co-workers, and your venture capital strategy and there's a good chance you can build a life-altering business that's rewarding personally and financially. 
Fred Wilson's post about Capital and Success says it well -- one shouldn't correlate fundraising to likelihood of success. 
Nor should you focus on whether or not you're a founder/investor/entrepreneur at a Unicorn. 
Remember even unicorns can be a mirage as Webvan, and now Fab demonstrate. 
If you 've been at a party at night, you might have trouble finding a drink in a cooler. 
Is that can bobbing in the ice water beer or soda pop? 
Put a glow stick in the water and light up the entire container. 
Glowsticks are waterproof and last for hours. 
They won't give off heat and melt the ice. 
Best of all, the sticks give the cooler a nice eerie glow. 
The second phase of Expedition 42 will launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome via Soyuz rocket above today at 4:01 PM EST.. 
Carrying three astronauts from ESA, NASA, and the Russian Federal Space Agency, the rocket will then rendezvous with the International Space Station about six hours later. 
You can watch the launch live via NASA TV with coverage beginning at 3pm, and you can also watch the crew dock with the space station as well later tonight at 9:53 pm. 
This will be astronaut Terry Virts second trip into space, but unlike his last trip, which only lasted two weeks, Virts will be taking up a more permanent residence for about five and half months. 
He 'll be a flight engineer during the 42 expedition and will be ISS commander during expedition 43. 
According to Popular Science, one of the team's goals will be preparing ISS for the new commercial transport vehicles being constructed by Boeing and SpaceX. 
Boeing's CST-100 Space Capsule and SpaceX's Dragon shared NASA's $ 6.8 billion space taxi program and is expected to end the U.S.'s reliance on Russia for rides to ISS. 
Oh, they 'll also be bringing an espresso machine. 
Need another reason to cheer on these astronauts? 
This picture should suffice: 
When the 25-year-old former Marine had a photo of her posted to Just the Tip, of the Spear last fall, she was so nervous she couldn't bear to look and asked a friend to check the page for her. 
The group's name, abbreviated JTTOTS, plays off of innuendo and the Marine Corps moniker as the Tip of the Spear. 
I freaked out ; I wouldn't even look at first, Keleher said. 
I have all of my social media set up so that it's private and so I was really confused how in the world they got a photo of me. 
I was terrified of the comments I was going to be receiving. 
A veteran of the war in Afghanistan, Keleher soon became intimately familiar with unofficial Marine Facebook pages like JTTOTS, which are forums for crude humor that often targets women. 
Female Marines are being openly harassed and denigrated on Facebook, in some cases by other active-duty Marines. 
Photos of Keleher have been published to the JTTOTS page three times. 
The ensuing comments were overtly sexual and some threatened sexual violence, Keleher said. 
The Marine Corps knows this is happening, and can do little to stop it. 
Military officials say they can't always identify those who post to the pages, and are at a loss when it comes to veterans and civilians harassing active-duty servicemen and women. 
These photos are often posted during Wook Wednesday, a popular segment which features images of female service members. 
Some of the pictures are innocent, others more risqué. 
Wook is a derogatory term for female Marines. 
The comments go beyond the usual trolling one sees on Facebook and quickly devolve into mudslinging, sexist remarks and worse. 
The threads frequently feature posts and memes about rape. 
In a recent post on JTTOTS, an active-duty Marine was featured in her uniform with another photo of her in an athletic top and bottom. 
Within an hour of the photos going up, a handful of memes had already been posted, many promoting sexual violence. 
One of the responses featured a picture of a dolphin in a pool and the phrase rape whistles don't work under water. 
These groups are public and those unfortunate enough to have photos posted of them are put on display. 
They are exposed to anyone who visits the page. 
Jason Lutcavage, a page administrator for POG Boot F - - - - said that his page and those like it are not forums for abuse and serve as a public space for infantry Marines to be themselves. 
POG means person other than grunt, and infantry Marines are often referred to as grunts. 
A boot is a colloquialism for a junior service member. 
Several such pages have been banned from Facebook. 
JTTOTS says it has been banned 21 times. 
Next in line is PBF, which is now on its 20th iteration, F 'N Wook is on its 14th, and Senior Lance Corporal is on its ninth. 
Each time these pages are removed from Facebook, they return within days with nearly as many members as before. 
For example, JTTOTS was last shut down Sept. 28. 
Two days later, it was back and already had 19,081 likes. 
Many of the pages function like a network. 
After a page has been taken down for violating Facebook's terms of service, the remaining groups encourage their members to like the newly recreated version. 
The Marine Corps came under fire over these Facebook groups in May 2013, when Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., sent an open letter concerning the group F 'N Wook to the commandant of the Marine Corps, the secretary of defense and the Pentagon's principal deputy inspector general. 
Speier accused the groups of contributing to a culture of sexual violence. 
While officially discouraging Marines from posting to these pages, the Corps has a limited reach when it comes to stopping this behavior online. 
It released a statement in 2010 setting out guidelines for service members using social media. 
There is no tolerance for discriminatory comments. 
It goes against good order and discipline, Flanagan said. 
This includes posting any defamatory, libelous, abusive, threatening, racially or ethnically hateful or otherwise offensive or illegal content. 
If a Marine is harassed on these sites, several things need to happen before any official action can be taken. 
First, the commenter needs to be identified. 
If the person is an active or reserve Marine, they are held accountable for their action. 
Official charges can result in counseling, relief of position, or non-judicial punishment -- which can mean a reduction in pay and rank, Flanagan said. 
However, when civilians or veterans harass active-duty Marines, there is little the Corps can do. 
Though this hasn't stopped them from trying. 
If postings violate the -LSB- site's -RSB- terms of service, we have reported it to the social media site, Flanagan said. 
There have been over three dozen instances of us working with social media sites to get pages removed. 
Shutting down the pages is little more than a game of digital Whac-A-Mole, Brian Adam Jones wrote in the blog. 
When the pages are shut down, they reappear within days and return to the same behavior. 
You have these types of pages that so freely hate whenever they can on female Marines and wan na do nothing but hate on us and it's a complete 180 of any experience I had when I was in -LSB- the Marines -RSB- and that right there shows me that this isn't Marine Corps culture. 
It's just an uneducated subculture, Keleher said. 
So why is it OK for them to do that, particularly to fellow service members -- people they could end up on the front lines with? 
Keleher said. 
It's not acceptable. 
It's not OK. 
Unless you unplugged your Internet and shut off your phone this week, you 've probably heard the tale of Computer Engineer Barbie. 
I won't spend too much time recapping it, but we cover it in more depth here. 
The short version: Mattel publishes a I Can Be A Computer Engineer Barbie book. 
Seemingly intended to encourage young girls to pursue a career in computer sciences, the book instead frames Barbie as something of a damsel-in-digital-distress who turns to her male friends every time something breaks. 
A few years later, blogger Pamela Ribon reads the book, and rightly slams it for being lame, full of cringe, and not the book that it should be. 
Anger spreads, Mattel apologizes, and the book gets pulled. 
But the idea of the book itself isn't a bad one -- it's the execution that was botched. 
An I Can Be A Computer Engineer Barbie book absolutely should exist -- just ... not this one.

Want to re-write the book yourself, perhaps? 
Better yet, you could use this tool custom built for the job.

Welcome to another week of Reading List where we dig through all those Black Friday deals assaulting your Twitter feed to bring some much deserved stories from around the web to your attention.

Nowadays, when someone says the world email, it's more likely to cause revulsion rather than excitement, but email has a way of haunting us with memories -- for better or worse. 
Unlike curated posts to social media, email are just brief snippets of communication and have much longer existence in comparison to Twitter. 
The Awl describes every email as a ghost story, and when you conjure them up, strange things can happen.

Charles Taylor is Liberian warlord who dragged his country into the trenches of a bloody civil conflict turned ethnic war in the 90s and eventually emerged as its president. 
However, it's not widely known that an American company had a lot to do with his ascent to power, the good ole Firestone tire manufacturer.

People in Germany who understand what happens when you have unfettered mass surveillance, where information is then out there being used for negative purposes, understand where that can lead. 
But if you have targeted information ... then we are in a society where that privacy balance is preserved, he continued, adding: It's the terrorists who want to deprive us of the freedoms that we all fight for. 
They're not interested in these freedoms. 
That's what I find is happening in the current narrative. 
Certainly across the European Union with more and more of my colleagues understanding that fighting for a balance and an understanding that mass surveillance has its damaging aspects is something that we need to deal with. 
Today as a result of having our inquiry even those people who started to call -LSB- Snowden -RSB- a traitor must now realize we have a whole group of people who must now at least understand that mass surveillance is something that is at least troubling and that we must do something about it, he said. 
The privacy agenda from the European Union now is very strong. 
However, despite more support for a privacy agenda at the European Parliament level he cautioned there are still huge vested interests pushing in the other direction -- so continuing to bang the drum for mass digital surveillance as a security panacea. 
It's therefore imperative that the EU throughly interrogates the technical and moral complexities underpinning this new human rights frontier, he said. 
The next phase of this enquiry into mass surveillance has to be about our security, a digital bill of rights, about where encryption is going, what the cloud means, where our privacy is going. 
Privacy is critical. 
And the idea that there is going to be no privacy unelect, or no idea of where we place privacy has got to be wrong, said Moraes. 
The next phase of our enquiry has to be on where we take this concept of privacy, where we take the concept of regulation. 
It is an extremely challenging time ... I don't have huge faith in many Member States to do this, there's so many vested interests, vested security interests to not do this -- but we have to try and do this. 
Ultimately the Member States will have to step up to the plate, because they ultimately control the agenda. 
If people in this room don't convince the individual Member States and governments of the big countries to make shifts on privacy, and to change the moral and political climate around security and privacy then of course we won't make real progress. 
And every time we get the shocks and changes in atmosphere around terrorism then we 'll take a step back. 
And of course we see that today -- with ISIS and ISIL, he said. 
It has been almost 20 years since Fogo, a shield volcano on the island of the same name in the Cape Verde Islands, erupted. 
However, it appears that the volcano's quiet has ended as a new eruption began this morning November 24. 
Officials in the Cape Verde Islands has announced evacuations of Cha das Caldeiras on the slopes of the volcano. 
The eruption has formed a small steam-and-ash plume near the flanks of Pico, a small cone inside the main caldera at Fogo. 
Earthquakes became noticeable to people living on the island starting Saturday night and by morning, an eruption had begun. 
According to volcanologists monitoring Fogo, the volcano had been showing signs of unrest for awhile. 
The Facebook page for FogoNews has some images of the new activity on the volcano, including some impressive shots of lava flows from the eruption see above and lava fountains as well. 
The lava close is close to cutting off the only road that connects to the two sides of the small island as well. 
Most of the activity at Fogo for the past 500 years has occurred within the main caldera of the volcano and the eruption in 1995 was centered on the flanks of Pico. 
The eruptions are dominantly lava flows, although unlike shield volcanoes like Kilauea, Fogo erupts both low-silica basanite similar to basalt but higher in alkaline elements like sodium and potassium and high-silica phonolite similar to rhyolite but higher alkalines. 
That eruption in 1995 created a lava flow field that spread over 6 square kilometers of the caldera floor. 
You can watch footage of the activity from the 1995 eruption -- lots of strombolian explosions and lava fountains to go with the lava flows. 
For months, the two sides have been trying to hammer out a historic accord curbing Iran's nuclear programs. 
The P5 +1 -- the U.S., Russia, China, U.K., France and Germany -- want to extend Iran's breakout time, or the time it would take the country to enrich enough uranium to make a nuclear weapon, while Iran wants to continue enriching for civilian purposes and wants the United States and its allies to lift its economic sanctions. 
Over the course of the negotiations, the relationship between the United States and Iran has warmed. 
That was most evident when President Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke on the phone a year ago. 
The phone call was the first time the heads of state of the two countries had talked since the 1979 Iranian revolution. 
In November, the two countries announced a historic, temporary deal that paused some of Iran's nuclear programs in hopes that a longer-term deal could be hammered out this year. 
The original deadline was extended. 
And after a flurry of negotiations at high levels of government this week, it seems likely to be extended again. 
` Our focus remains on taking steps forward toward an agreement, but it is only natural that just over 24 hours from the deadline we are discussing a range of options both internally and with our P5 +1 partners six powers,' a senior State Department official said on condition of anonymity. 
` An extension is one of those options,' the official added after Kerry and Zarif met in the Austrian capital. 
` It should come as no surprise that we are also engaged in a discussion of the options with the Iranians.' 
While not necessarily surprising, it's important to note that both sides have insisted that they would not issue a second extension. 
The Wall Street Journal reports that this time around -- especially with Obama's party losing the Senate -- an extension will be a tougher sell. 
A fundamental challenge may be more in justifying why an extension won't turn the diplomatic effort into what Europeans once derisively called talks for the sake of talks. 
... There are a few key issues dividing the sides. 
Most notable are the cap on Iran's future nuclear enrichment activities, the timing of sanctions relief, limits on Iran's future nuclear research, and the length of an agreement. 
Diplomats suggest that while much has been said about areas of basic agreement since July, there have been few major advances on key outstanding differences. 
Several Western diplomats have said the Iranian team appears not to have the political flexibility to cut tough compromises on these highly sensitive issues at this stage. 
Iranian officials have on their side consistently complained of excessive Western demands. 
But this isn't just another entry into the continually growing list of viruses, Symantec says this malware displays a degree of technical competence rarely seen. 
The researchers refer to Regin as being similar to the Stuxnet computer worm, also discovered by Symantec in 2010, that was allegedly used to attack Iran's nuclear centrifuges. 
The only conclusion is that this tool was developed by a nation with some considerable technological means, as Symantec describes: 
It is likely that its development took months, if not years, to complete and its authors have gone to great lengths to cover its tracks. 
Its capabilities and the level of resources behind Regin indicate that it is one of the main cyberespionage tools used by a nation state. 
Regin has been out in the digital wild since at least 2008, operates much like a back-door Trojan, and has been used against governments, internet providers, telecom companies, researchers, businesses, and private individuals, says Symantec. 
Regin affects Windows-based computers and operates in five stages, giving the attacker a powerful framework for mass surveillance and offers flexibility so attackers can customize the packages embedded within the malware. 
However, no reported instances of Regin have been found in the U.S. Symantec's provided geographic breakdown shows Saudi Arabia and Russia as primary targets of Regin spyware, taking up more than half of all recorded cases. 
Other countries include Mexico, Iran, Afghanistan, India as well as European countries like Belgium and Ireland. 
It's speculated that most infections came from people visiting spoofed versions of well-known websites, says Symantec, though one case confirms Yahoo! 
Messenger was also involved. 
In an interview with Re/Code, Symantec researcher Liam O'Murchu said that they know it was created by a technologically advanced country. 
Of course, the short list points to two obvious possibilities, the U.S. or China, but it's impossible to say for sure as there's much left to learn 
Is it surprising that massive spyware systems exist on the web that we use every day? 
Unfortunately, not really, but when you actually see all the details laid out in front of you, it can be pretty frightening.

According to the app's Facebook page, Bumble is a social discovery app that promotes a safe and respectful community where you 'll never get unwanted messages and your suggestions will be more relevant than the dead-end matches you find on other, more shallow apps. 
You can check out the full description here. 
Yesterday, Bumbleapp had a public Instagram account that showed a preview video of the app, which seems to look a lot like Tinder. 
It shows a user making a match and chatting. 
The account has since gone private, which might have to do with us looking into the company pre-launch. 
The Facebook page for the app shows a photo of the making of the app's launch video, showing a helicopter and a boat being used during production. 
Boats n' bees, read the caption. 
There are also photos on the founders' Instagram accounts of video shoots to promote the app at Ham Yard Hotel in London. 
While Gulzcynski and Mick are repping Bumble hard on their social media, Wolfe has seemingly kept a low profile, not posting anything about the stealthy startup. 
However, sources tell us that Wolfe is at the helm alongside Mick and Gulzcynski. 
You can see in this photo from a month ago, posted by Mick, that Wolfe is sitting at what appears to be a startup office in front of a computer. 
The caption reads working late. 
The company, which is officially called Moxco Limited, lists its place of business in London, according to the privacy policy. 
But you can see from the Instagram accounts of Gulczynski and Mick that the team has been traveling quite a bit. 
There was a trip to Greece on a private plane, where they stayed in a villa, and then to Paris. 
Not to mention multiple trips to and from London and Los Angeles. 
It's unclear just how much the company has raised, but one source told TechCrunch that it's in the millions. 
We 've also heard about a number of different sources for the funding, including social dating service Badoo and Michael Herd, the multi-millionaire heir to an oil fortune. 
This summer, during the time of the lawsuit, sources told TechCrunch that Wolfe and Herd had been in a relationship. 
It's unclear if the romantic relationship continues. 
However, we're told that the private jet ferrying the team to and from London belongs to Herd. 
In this photo from three months ago, you can see both Herd and Wolfe on the plane, and here you can see all four of them Herd, Wolfe, Gulzcynski, and Mick in London a couple of months ago. 
The fact that Wolfe, Gulczynski and Mick are launching a direct competitor to Tinder brings up a number of interesting points. 
Of course, the most obvious one is that they 'll have inside knowledge of their biggest competitor, quite a bit of experience building an app like this, and they have enough public visibility to spread awareness quickly. 
Beyond that, the app seems squarely countered against a ` shallow' Tinder experience where you receive ` unwanted messages', all with the subtext that the founder of Bumble actually received unwanted messages from the co-founders of Tinder. 
We 've reached out to the Bumble team but have yet to hear back. 
Same goes for Tinder.

When you leave your job, federal law requires your employer to let you stay on your existing health insurance. 
You 'll pay full price for that insurance without an employer subsidy. 
You might consider buying your own insurance on the marketplace instead. 
During your 60-day grace period you should definitely check out your options on the marketplace to see what kind of financial help you can get, and select some plans you think you might like. 
When you give your income information to the marketplace, you will also find out whether you may qualify for Medicaid for yourself or CHIP for your children. 
Then you can compare your marketplace options to the COBRA plan.In most situations the marketplace plan will probably be cheaper than COBRA. 
But there are other things to consider, too: If it's later in the year, you may have met your work plan's deductible, whereas if you start a new plan, you 'll have to meet the new deductible from scratch. 
Be sure to take this into consideration when you run the numbers.If you are in the middle of treatment for a serious condition, check to see whether your providers take part in any marketplace plans. 
This week some of the world's biggest apps just got better. 
Snapchat introduced an in-app payment system, powered by Square, called Snapcash, and WhatsApp began rolling out the largest implementation of end-to-end encryption ever. 
Oh yeah, and Facebook released a thing. 
But amidst all these blockbuster headlines, lots of great apps joined iOS and Android, not to mention two official apps for Windows Phone in its ongoing quest to close the app gap. 
Here are the best apps of the week. 
Grabbing headlines with its return to the hardware game with the N1 Android tablet, Nokia also launched an Android launcher meant to make Google fans lives a little bit easier. 
This app was originally announced in June but Nokia released the Z Launcher beta earlier this week. 
Perhaps its most interesting feature is letting you quickly search your app drawer by physically drawing letters on the screen with your finger. 
It's a little quirky and has a few rough edges that need smoothing, but it's worth the test drive considering it requires no monetary commitment.

These are gadgets and pieces of tech fashioned into greatness after their extinction where consumers, experts, and bloggers can see more clearly with the added benefit of hindsight. 
Whenever I think about a gadget that died before its prime, my thoughts inevitably turned toward the Sega Dreamcast. 
When I bought this quirky little guy back in 1999, I was enchanted by the idea of having a display in my controller. 
Crazy Taxi's graphics looked amazingly stellar for the time. 
Not to mention that the Dreamcast was the first console ever to come with a built-in modem so you could play online. 
The Dreamcast's forward-thinking hardware really wasn't the problem though. 
It was the third-party desert in which it resided.

A couple weeks ago, The New Yorker published a lovely little essay about the eccentric rocker, Ariel Pink. 
The whole conversation takes place in an SUV bound from Pink's Williamsburg hotel to a show in Staten Island. 
Pink rehashes some recent social media controversies and some other thoughts on his own fame. 
The whole encounter could best be described as strange, which coincidentally, is the perfect adjective for Pink's new album, pom pom. 
The first time I listened to this haphazard, chaotic, beautiful disaster, I wasn't immediately smitten. 
In fact, I'd say my expression hovered between surprise and bemusement. 
Pom pom is an amalgamation of the sonically wonderful White Freckles and the truly bizarre Black Ballerina and at no point does it show any signs of predictability. 
Without a doubt, there is no album like this in 2014, and I think that's why after giving it one listen, I found myself quickly returning for another, and another, and another. 
A lot of these tracks wouldn't be out of place in say an 80s workout video or as the haunting soundtrack of Adult Swim's next Too Many Cooks-inspired creation. 
It shares that same sense of unrestricted experimentation. 
In some songs it succeeds completely and in others not as much, but regardless it's an experience worth hearing at least once -- if not again and again.

The book was soooo much better is a phrase that screams to me let's not be friends. 
It is almost a given at this point, that whenever one thing is adapted from another thing, the original thing is always vastly superior -- except when it's not. 
One bit of big movie news this week is Chris Pratt signing on for another comic book adaptation, this time A.J. Lieberman's Cowboy Ninja Viking. 
This news got me wondering when was the last time I saw a movie that was actually better than the comic it was based on. 
Immediately this film came to mind. 
A History of Violence began as a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke. 
A nice little comic but by no means an Alan Moore-level epic that aimed to change the medium or even mob fiction for that matter. 
It simply was nothing spectacular, but Cronenberg turned mediocrity into cinema perfection. 
Any movie with the word violence in the title is bound to have plenty of it, and this one definitely does. 
In case you didn't already know, the film follows Viggo Mortensen Tom Stall, an owner of a small-town diner whose violent past get it? 
catches up with him. 
Where the first half has some resemblance of the OGN, Cronenberg takes several liberties in the film second half and thrusts A History of Violence into the must watch category of the expansive mob film genre. 
A History of Violence is a film in defiance of the book is better cliché, and giving me the rare respite from that phrase makes me love this movie even more.

21 days. 
That's the time it will take to complete the largest train journey in the world. 
6,200 miles 9977 kilometers that go from Yiwu, China, to Madrid, Spain. 
It's also part of the New Silk Road, a Chinese project to gain control over transcontinental cargo transportation between Asia and Europe. 
The route is much longer than the Trans-Siberian Railway, which at 5,772 miles 9,289 km was the previous record holder. 
The Washington Post writes: 
On Nov. 18, an 82-container freight train left the eastern Chinese industrial city of Yiwu. 
It was embarking on a landmark journey that is supposed to end 21 days later, in December, in Madrid. 
The Yiwu-Madrid train route is part of the New Silk Road, a project that the Chinese government wants to revitalize intercontinental trade. 
They are spending $ 40 billion in this bid to gain control of land-based transportation through Asia and Europe -- and that's just the beginning. 
It has been almost 20 years since Fogo, a shield volcano on the island of the same name in the Cape Verde Islands, erupted. 
However, it appears that the volcano's quiet has ended as a new eruption began this morning November 24. 
Officials in the Cape Verde Islands has announced evacuations of Cha das Caldeiras on the slopes of the volcano. 
The eruption has formed a small steam-and-ash plume near the flanks of Pico, a small cone inside the main caldera at Fogo. 
Earthquakes became noticeable to people living on the island starting Saturday night and by morning, an eruption had begun. 
According to volcanologists monitoring Fogo, the volcano had been showing signs of unrest for awhile. 
The Facebook page for FogoNews has some images of the new activity on the volcano, including some impressive shots of lava flows from the eruption see above and lava fountains as well. 
The lava close is close to cutting off the only road that connects to the two sides of the small island as well. 
Most of the activity at Fogo for the past 500 years has occurred within the main caldera of the volcano and the eruption in 1995 was centered on the flanks of Pico. 
The eruptions are dominantly lava flows, although unlike shield volcanoes like Kilauea, Fogo erupts both low-silica basanite similar to basalt but higher in alkaline elements like sodium and potassium and high-silica phonolite similar to rhyolite but higher alkalines. 
That eruption in 1995 created a lava flow field that spread over 6 square kilometers of the caldera floor. 
You can watch footage of the activity from the 1995 eruption -- lots of strombolian explosions and lava fountains to go with the lava flows. 
Smartwatches for children hold a lot of allure and at least one analysis firm believes they will help drive the smartwatch market to 373 million devices shipped in 2020, up from 15 million this year. 
Kids get a shiny new gadget, while anxious parents get location trackers and activity monitors to keep tabs on their offspring. 
Children's smartwatches, however, suffer from the same problem that other toys do: the very short attention spans of their target market. 
A Taipei-based hardware startup called JoyRay wants to create a smartwatch for kids that won't end up abandoned like the Velveteen Rabbit. 
Founder and CEO Jerry Chang, who was division head of Foxconn's smartphone business before leaving last December, believes the key to creating a kids' smartwatch with enduring appeal is to provide an open SDK and release new apps by JoyRay and third-party developers every month. 
Called Jumpy, JoyRay's smartwatch is designed for kids aged five to eight and Android and iOS compatible. 
It has an open SDK, and a host of features software developers can play with, including a detachable watch head, gyroscope, gesture and voice recognition, and Bluetooth connectivity. 
Jumpy is currently on Kickstarter, where it has raised about half of the $ 100,000 it wants to reach by December 18. 
The smartwatch's Kickstarter price is $ 99 and it is scheduled to ship in March, a goal Chang is confident it can reach because Jumpy has a working prototype which I saw demoed at JoyRay's office and a manufacturing partnership with Foxconn. 
One of the reasons I like Jumpy is because its creators are eager to make sure children use the smartwatch to interact with their parents and the world around them, instead of just staring at its screen. 
For example, JoyRay is currently working on an app that will allow kids to control Sphero, a Bluetooth-connected ball, by waving their hands around. 
The smartwatch will be shipped with an activity monitor app that features a cartoon dog named Chubby who reminds kids to move around and drink enough water. 
While at Foxconn, Chang, who has two young children, brought home one of the original equipment manufacturing giant's smartwatch prototypes. 
His son was enthralled and wanted to bring it to school to show off to his classmates. 
JoyRay's team includes co-founder and developer David Liu, who is in charge of overseeing the apps Jumpy will come preloaded with, as well as its future releases. 
Liu's own startup, LND Games, created Color Band, a nifty motion-sensor based iOS app that teaches children about color and music theory. 
Color Band was profiled by TechCrunch last year and later featured by the App Store. 
Jumpy features a larger screen 1.6-inches square than most of its competitors and the watch head can detach from its silicon band. 
This allows it to be used as a controller in other games or attached to other devices. 
In the works is an educational app for tablets that is like an updated version of Operation. 
The app features a drawing of a human body that reveals organs and bones when Jumpy's watch head is passed over it like an X-ray. 
Jumpy's watch head can also be incorporated into other devices. 
As a stretch goal for its Kickstarter campaign, JoyRay is currently working on a charger that is shaped like a robot or dog. 
When inserted, Jumpy's watch head becomes the toy's face, giving kids yet another way to interact with it. 
It's supposed to encourage them to be more active, but if you read reviews on Amazon and other sites, you see parents saying that while their kids were really excited at first, they were bored by it within a couple of weeks. 
So when we started developing Jumpy, we wanted it to be open platform. 
We have our own team of app developers and are also partnering with third-party developers to focus on educational, exercise, and entertainment apps. 
When Jumpy ships, it will come with about eight to 10 apps, including games, an exercise reminder and monitor, a location tracker, and a messaging app that sends emojis or voice messages to smartphones and other Jumpys. 
Data is uploaded through wifi to the cloud so parents can monitor their kids' activities on an iPad app. 
After that, JoyRay plans to release new apps on a monthly basis, including gesture-based games, storytelling apps, and language-learning tools. 
It also plans to integrate Jumpy with connected toys, like Sphero, that have open SDKs. 
As we talk to consumers, we will keep adding new functions and games. 
We believe that Jumpy has a lot more possibilities beyond other kids' smartwatches, says Chang. 
While Jumpy's competitors already include Filip, Kidizoom, the aforementioned Leapband, as well as a host of GPS and activity trackers, Chang believes Jumpy's open platform, larger screen, and detachable watch head will allow it to stand out in what is sure to be an increasingly crowded market.

There should be a name for the coginitive disconnect that everyone experiences with the Internet that says I support the worldwide disruption of everything to get to a more democratic or eglaitarian way of doing things except as it affects me. 
From wine to window cleaning it's the same everywhere: We expect everyone else in the world to adapt to the new froodier more exotic way of doing things until it comes knocking at our door. 
Then we're shocked that our industry is no longer business as usual. 
SHOCKED. 
This even happens in such forward-facing industries as gaming. 
For example this week in crowdfunding two pieces of news underscored for me at least how badly many game developers handle change. 
They are the news that Frontier Developments abruptly decided to stop developing a key promised feature for Elite Dangerous, and the news that Valve had to publish rules to tell developers to stop messing Early Access customers around. 
The games industry has of course long been on the forefront of crowdfunding. 
Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Steam's Early Access and even Minecraft's use of Paypal are all examples of this sort of thing, and some of the biggest stories around crowfunding have emanated from games OUYA, Star Citizen and so on. 
And yet despite all that game developers often don't seem to understand what crowdfunding means. 
It means letting people in. 
More than anything else the key lesson of crowdfunding is that by going to the crowd you are asking for community as well as cash, asking people to join you, to support you, and essentially promising them an ear. 
Whether it's a card game or a whole gaming console, the crowdfunding transaction is more than just finance. 
It's tribal. 
It's a movement. 
The problem that I perceive is that many games people don't seem to understand that. 
They understand the first part well enough, that with the the right campaign a Kickstarter might raise millions of dollars and set a studio on the path to success. 
But when it comes to fulfilling the other half of what that implies, they balk. 
Some are fearful that community involvement in design corrupts their vision for example. 
That is a legitimate fear because design by committee is rarely anything but terrible and it comes at the cost of your soul. 
However I think it's not that common for communities that form around crowdfunded games to actually want that. 
The crowd chose to support the game maker because the game they're making seems to be cool. 
That means they trust the game maker to make a great game, but at the same time they'd appreciate being listened to. 
Nobody supporting the campaign for That Dragon Cancer wants its developers to change their story, they just want to feel involved disclosure: I worked a little with the developers making TDC, and I absolutely biasedly think you should support them. 
However the greater problem, I think, is how many developers haven't updated their sense of how to deal with the public. 
Game development is generally a very sheltered industry. 
There is what goes on the industry and there is what goes on the fan community, and those two worlds only interface under select -- and often very managed -- circumstances. 
The game maker is generally used to talking at the audience through an interpreter such as journalist, podcaster, YouTuber or other intermediary. 
He's actually used to that PR layer of insulation that keeps real people at about three steps remove and works to present a best-foot-forward image to the press, the fans and the community. 
And in that world the developer/studio is used to thinking of the money that comes at them as investment from the bank. 
All professional investment tends to carry a sense of risk with it, a sense of hey guys we're all taking a bet here. 
Any game project funded by a publisher or investor is understood to likely only meet half of its wild promises, to evetually have to cut, compromise, revise and pivot along the way. 
We professionals generally understand that is just how life is. 
We regard the contract between us and the money as a promise to build something roughly like what the vision promised, but not quite. 
The problem is that crowfunders are not professional investors. 
They're amateurs, people who invest for love and meaning and not at all to do with the business side. 
They're ardent fans, supporters, eventually a marketing channel. 
But when we treat them like the bank, when we high-hand them with declarations of changes and say It's just a PR problem, the fault is ours. 
When we solicit their money and then disappear for a year only to surface with some weak-ass version of the thing that we promised, the fault is again ours. 
There's no ther way to say it. 
We're basically ripping them off. 
There has always been a dimension of the games industry that has questionable morals. 
In all sectors there are plenty of journeyman projects whose developers take whatever coin they can because they're just trying to make ends meet, That kind of work is just part of the business and we 've all done it at least some of the time. 
I fear however that in dealing with crowdfunding many of us are basically take the same stance: All that matters is getting the check in the door, and what follows is just business as usual. 
Is it really so hard to understand that the way to deal with a crowdfund community or anything social network based is to talk to its participants as human beings rather than hiding behind PR bullshit or disappearing altogether? 
I don't mean that as an insult against PR folks either -- the best ones I 've worked with all talk about the importance of voice and authenticity and actively dissuade clients from treating the public like they used to treat the press. 
Yet said clients do so anyway. 
There might be an element of age to this. 
I notice that many younger indie developers seem more at ease with the idea that they should just talk to people one of my favorite is my friend Mike Bithell and avoid the instinct to massage. 
They have no problem admitting their failings, of realizing that a chink in the armor does not equate to the press corps jumping up and down on them with glee and fans caterwauling at your graveside well maybe Gamergate might, but I mean regular folks. 
They just want to be treated like supporters rather than spoonfed children. 
As the industry continues to evolve, and crowfunding with it, my earnest hope is that the games industry stops trying to hold its audience at quite such a remove. 
Nobody's asking developers and publishers to change ther plans on the basis of fan polls or whatever, nor even for a seat at the table. 
They're asking that if there are problems, if things aren't working out, or promises need to be broken, that they be included in that process. 
Some may feel hurt or betrayed anyway, but in the long run I think that the developer who talks is the one to whom fans will return again and again. 
Whereas the one who plays shenanigans will get tagged, perhaps irreparably. 
Snapchat took its first shot at monetizing its Our Stories collaborative Livestream feature tonight with a Samsung-branded look at The American Music Awards. 
We were tipped off to the AMA Our Story, and Snapchat confirms to me that it was paid by Samsung to show it. 
The ad intersplices Sponsored - tagged Samsung photos and videos from behind the scenes at the AMAs with user-generated shots from the crowd and red carpet. 
The sponsored Our Story demonstrates how Snapchat could make money off branded content that feels more natural in its app than the pure advertisement snaps it recently begun showing. 
Snapchat first launched the Our Story feature in June to give people around the world a simulated experience of attending the Electric Daisy Carnival dance music festival. 
Anyone within the geofence of the festival in Las Vegas could submit Snaps of photos or videos to the EDC Our Story. 
Snapchat then curated the submission, choosing the best to show on the EDC Our Story that's visible to all users globally if they added EDC Live to their list of Stories updates from friends. 
I attended the festival and was astounded by how accurate Our Story's potrayal was. 
I called it a genius, collaborative reinvention of the livestream, and suggested that Events might also be willing to pay for the promotion and cool-factor Snapchat could provide by setting them up with an Our Story. 
After successful Our Stories for the World Cup and Super Bowl, Snapchat started regularly showing cool festivals and holidays from around the world. 
Now we're seeing the first that paid to be featured and automatically added to Snapchat users' friend lists. 
In this case, it's Samsung paying for the AMAs to appear as an Our Story with its ads mixed in. 
Unfortunately, the Samsung Snaps in the Story feel much less natural or compelling than the user generated content. 
A bland video of a woman's feet on the red carpet emblazoned with AMAs ... Powered By Samsung Galaxy serves as the title screen and first slide. 
After some shots of celebrities entering the awards show and performing outside, we get a drab Backstage -- American Music Awards. 
Powered By Samsung Galaxy video of the production studio editing the taping for live TV. 
After some clips of Taylor Swift performing on stage and One Direction winning an award get ... a stagehand pushing an equipment case through the backstage? 
I'm not sure who thought Snapchat users would want to see these boring clips of how the AMAs get made. 
They stick out like sore thumbs but at least they only last a few seconds and can be skipped with a tap. 
Not being forced to watch these ads is an important point. 
Just like its standard ads that it just began showing, starting with a video promoting new horror film Ouija, it's not making them interruptive. 
Don't want to watch? 
Don't tap. 
That minimizes the backlash from its fickle youth-centered audience its spent years stealing from competing social apps like Instagram. 
Snapchat has done a remarkable job of making Our Story supremely watchable, even for off-kilter events like a hot air baloon festival with no name-brand. 
That's because it's taken great care in curating which events it picks as well as the snaps it shows. 
For Sponsored Our Stories to succeed, it has to maintain that high bar of curation. 
It can't allow lame events to get the Our Story treament, and it has to teach businesses how to make their branded-clips fun. 
It needs Twitter Samsung Ellen Selfie-quality branded content. 
Otherwise, the audience that returns to Our Story will disappear faster than ... Facebook's latest standalone app. 
Facebook can be a little stalky, Twitter full of people who want you to listen to them, and 4chan is ... well, 4chan. 
So what would all these corners of the Internet translate to if you imagined them as real life phenomena? 
That's what Doghouse Diaries has tried to do with this cartoon.

Indonesia is one of the world's fastest growing markets for mobile devices. 
Over one in five Indonesians already use a smartphone and that number is expected to increase rapidly over the next few years. 
Despite a very promising market opportunity, however, Indonesian startups still have to deal with many drawbacks, including lack of venture capital funding and mentorship. 
Convergence Accel, a Jarkarta-based VC firm, wants to change that. 
Convergence Accel just announced a $ 25 million fund that will focus on early stage startups in Indonesia. 
Its partners, Adrian Li and Donald Wihardja, also plan to bring mentorship from U.S. and China-based venture capitalists to enterpreneurs. 
The new fund plans to invest up to $ 500,000 in 25 to 30 startups over the next five years, with followup funding for the most promising companies. 
Convergence Accel has already participated in online publication Female Daily Network's $ 1 million Series A. 
Li is upbeat about Indonesia's growth prospects, noting that in 2018 there are expected to be over 150 million smartphones in Indonesia, with over 100 million using 3G or faster connections. 
On the adoption side, we recently saw in Mary Meeker's presentation that Indonesia already has the highest consumption of screen minutes per capita globally, together with the fourth largest Facebook population and some of the most engaged Twitter users. 
Adoption of Internet products clearly has momentum, Li said in an email. 
Finally, with an economy nearing 50 percent of Southeast Asia's total GDP and among the fastest growing at a forecast seven percent, Indonesia clearly has a lot of market potential in the next decade. 
I think of Indonesia as China albeit one-fifth the size five years ago, he added. 
In order to help them tap into Indonesia's market, Convergence Accel will not only provide funding, but also a mentoring network that will connect startup founders with successful entrepreneurs and companies. 
Li also points to several major raises by Indonesian companies, like online marketplace Tokopedia which recently landed $ 100 million led by SoftBank Capital as a sign of increasing interest in Indonesia's startup ecosystem. 
Convergence Accel is not certainly alone in focusing on Southeast Asia startups. 
In addition to SoftBank Capital, other investment firms interested in the region include Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten and Singapore-based Monk's Hill Ventures. 
NPR -- along with seven public radio stations around the country -- is chronicling the lives of America's troops where they live. 
We're calling the project Back at Base. 
She's flat on her stomach in the dirt, in full combat gear. 
Suddenly she pops up, slings a 44-pound metal tripod on her back and lurches forward in a crab-like run. 
Finally, she slams the tripod to the ground. 
A male Marine slaps a .50 - caliber machine gun into place. 
They fire imaginary bullets at an unseen target before pulling back. 
The exercise is over. 
Abrego who is just 20 years old and stands at 5 foot 2 inches explains why she volunteered for this training at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. 
Hopefully, I 'll be able to go overseas and kick bad guys butts, she says. 
An uncle who served in the Marines inspired her, and she wants to be a role model to her six brothers and sisters. 
But she knows she will have to train hard to get a slot in the infantry. 
I 've just got to get used to it, Abrego says. 
The more I do it, the better I get. 
A strong mind can do it. 
But even a strong mind and body might not be enough. 
The Marines will spend the next year trying to decide whether women -- who make up just 7 percent of the Marine Corps -- have what it takes to serve in the tough, unforgiving world of ground combat. 
And this is just the beginning. 
The real test comes next year when they head to the Mojave Desert and to the Sierra Nevada Mountains for months of live fire combat training. 
This could include climbing over walls to attack enemy targets or digging in defensive positions. 
You fall back on your training, Kaster explains. 
It's all about how you were trained. 
That's what we're trying to have instilled in them -- the whole fight or flight thing. 
You fight, you fight, you fight, and when you think you're done fighting, you're ready to keep fighting. 
Bigger than me, she says. 
It was bigger than me. 
I'm pretty little. 
If the women can get the -LSB- same -RSB- job done as a man, then why not? 
she says. 
It's clear that some of the women are keeping up with the men. 
One of them is 20-year-old Lance Cpl. Britanny Hayes, who made it through a basic infantry training course before coming to Camp Lejeune. 
Nearly all the men finished the course, but of the 50 women who started out, just 14 made it through. 
A lot was just pride, Hayes says. 
I have too much pride, so I just refused to quit. 
A lot of them, actually, they like it, she says. 
They just want to see, like, can we really do it? 
They say,' I can't wait until you fail. 
I give it a couple of months,' Hayes says. 
Joking, but they're serious. 
Kaster knows there are mixed feelings about bringing women into ground combat jobs. 
For him, it comes down to some basic questions. 
If we integrate, is our combat effectiveness different with integration than it is without integration? 
he asks. 
Are we more effective without females or with females? 
The Marine Corps hopes to answer those questions with this task force. 
Four hundred marines -- including about 100 women -- are training to see whether both women and men can meet the combat standards. 
They 'll track speed, endurance and marksmanship. 
Sensors on their weapons will pinpoint who hits a target. 
They 'll test how an all-male squad compares with a squad with one woman, then two women. 
After this experiment is completed, senior Marine officials will make their recommendation to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel next fall. 
Then he 'll have to decide: Should women marines be allowed to serve in ground combat jobs, or not? 
This is an emotional topic, she says. 
If you served 60 years ago, you have a comment about it, she says. 
If you're serving now, you 've been in six minutes, you have a comment about it, and that's okay. 
Everybody has their opinion on this, he says. 
I'm focused on my mission, and the mission is about readiness. 
Readiness has nothing to do with male, female, he adds. 
Readiness has everything to do with having the most qualified and capable Marines to be able to perform those tasks. 
Joint Chiefs chairman, Gen. Martin Dempsey, has said that women must meet the combat standards, but the current standards themselves will come under scrutiny. 
He spoke about this last year: If we do decide that a particular standard is so high that a woman couldn't make it, the burden is now on the service to come back and explain to the secretary why is it that high? 
Does it really have to be that high? 
Does a Marine really have to carry a 100-pound pack 20 miles? 
Are 20 pull-ups the right measure for the strength needed in combat? 
A marine squad must shoot 400 bullets in one minute at targets, a standard that has been in effect since 1944. 
Do these standards still make sense today? 
Let's be fair, honest and clear, says 1st Sgt. John Dober, who served in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
We kill people for a living. 
That's what we do, and it's very dangerous, and these are people's sons' and potentially daughters' lives we're talking about. 
We owe them the protection that they deserve, and the best possible chance to bring them home alive, he adds. 
And lowering the standard and making this less effective and slower and weaker, that's not the smartest way to guarantee that we do that. 
Floto hopes to meet those standards. 
She's been in the Marine Corps for three years, working as a combat photographer. 
But she wants something more. 
Dr. Oliver Korshin practices ophthalmology three days a week in the same small office in east Anchorage he's had for three decades. 
Many of his patients have aged into their Medicare years right along with him. 
For his tiny practice, which employs just one part-time nurse, putting all his patients' medical records in an online database just doesn't make sense, Korshin says. 
It would cost too much to install and maintain -- especially considering that he expects to retire in just a few years. 
No possible business model would endorse that kind of implementation in a practice situated like mine, he says. 
It's crazy. 
But starting next year the federal government will penalize Korshin and other doctors for not using electronic health records ; Medicare will withhold 1 percent of his payments. 
What's more, Korshin will lose another 1.5 percent for failing to enroll in a federal program that requires doctors to digitally keep track of and report quality data about how their patients fare under their care. 
And then there's the new coding system, also set to take effect in the the fall of 2015 -- an overhaul of the standard method of classifying diseases and conditions. 
Medicare and other insurers require the proper use of these codes if doctors want to get paid for the treatments and procedures they perform. 
A cost study sponsored by the American Medical Association earlier this year estimated that, depending on variable factors such as specialty, vendor and software, implementing the new coding system alone could cost a small medical practice between $ 56,639 and $ 226,105. 
All these technological initiatives are designed to improve medicine -- to bring it into the digital age. 
But Korshin and many other doctors with small practices say they feel overwhelmed, and can't keep up. 
This flurry of things one has to comply with means that unless you work for a large organization, like a hospital, that can devote staff and time to dealing with these issues, there's no economy of scale, Korshin laments. 
I can't share these expenses with anybody. 
Korshin may seem like an outlier -- close to retirement with a very small practice. 
But he has lots of company, says Mike Haugen of the Alaska State Medical Association. 
Most practices in Alaska are small practices, Haugen says. 
They're one, two and three doctor practices. 
The number of really large practices -- and that's relative in Alaska -- you can probably count them on one hand. 
There won't be some flashing neon sign we ever see that says X-number of doctors have left, he says. 
It's a very quiet process. 
And that, for me, is the scary part. 
Because you take a look at the medical association membership a year or two from now, and it may be smaller. 
And access to care in this state is a real issue. 
Rebecca Madison thinks a lot of doctors would decide to stay in practice if they had help with the transition to electronic health records. 
That's Madison's job as executive director of Alaska eHealth Network -- she wants to make it as easy as possible for providers to make the switch. 
She tries to sell doctors on the benefits. 
She reminds them electronic records can make their offices more efficient and give them better data on the care they're providing. 
The systems can also lower billing costs, she explains. 
We work with providers to ensure that they have the best experience they can, going into an electronic health record, she says, because it really is changing your entire practice. 
It's not easy. 
There's a project in the neighborhood of Harlem in New York that has a through-the-looking glass quality. 
An organization called City Health Works is trying to bring an African model of health care delivery to the United States. 
Usually it works the other way round. 
One of the people behind the experiment, which builds on the public-health technique of community outreach, is Manmeet Kaur. 
Kaur is a native New Yorker who grew up in Queens. 
About a decade ago, just after she graduated from college, she spent time in Cape Town, South Africa. 
While there, she worked with a community health group called Mamelani Projects that tried to tackle some of the chronic health problems in the poor neighborhoods of Cape Town, especially HIV infection and AIDS. 
The organization had an interesting way of tackling those problems. 
They hired people from the community as peer health educators, she says. 
These weren't people with medical backgrounds. 
They were just local residents - people who were willing to help out. 
One of the people Kaur was most impressed by was a woman named Thandi. 
What was most powerful was her ability to draw from the life experiences of people she worked with to help them make better informed decisions, says Kaur. 
No amount of training can help you do that when you don't have the same life experience of the people you're working with. 
Skip forward to 2011. 
Now Kaur is married and living in Harlem, another poor neighborhood where people have a lot of chronic health problems, including HIV infection and diabetes. 
Her husband was training to be a doctor. 
As part of his training, he worked at a clinic that treats people with diabetes. 
As I watched my husband begin residency, it just seemed to me he had an extremely short amount of time to talk to somebody, she says. 
That's how the idea for City Health Works was born. 
Kaur's husband, Dr. Prabhjot Singh, partnered with Kaur to get the project off the ground. 
The pair raised about a million dollars from three sources: The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation also a supporter of NPR, the Robin Hood Foundation, and Mt. Sinai Hospital, where Singh works. 
Singh says a lot of the people he sees in his clinic at Mt. Sinai are in really bad shape. 
People you'd expect to see in the hospital. 
People you couldn't imagine are in such a late stage of illness, he says. 
It's this population City Health Works really wants to help. 
The idea is to get patients to the clinic before they get so sick, and then help them stay out of the clinics going forward. 
We really need an ambassador, he says. 
Somebody that really understands the clinical environment, but is deeply embedded in the community. 
City Health Works hires people like Norma Melendez to be those ambassadors. 
Melendez does not have a medical background. 
She's what City Health Works calls a health coach. 
Her job is to work with patients after they 've visited the clinic. 
She goes to their homes, makes sure they 've got the medicine, makes sure they take it, and shows them how to stay on a diet their doctor has ordered. 
These may seem like easy tasks, but they aren't, especially when you don't have a lot of money. 
I live in this immediate neighborhood, so I can relate to a lot of the people who live in my community, says Melendez. 
I 've faced many of the similar barriers once upon a time, or someone I know has faced these similar barriers. 
Hiring people like Melendez, people deeply embedded in the community, as Singh puts it, is one of the things that sets City Health Works apart from other programs that use community health workers. 
This is an opportunity for a much more intimate relationship, much faster, says Paul Tarini, senior project officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. 
Such relationships should yield better health outcomes. 
On the day I met Melendez she was visiting a woman in one of the housing projects near the hospital. 
We came along with the understanding that health privacy laws prevented our using any of her clients' full names. 
The woman we met that day introduced herself as Mrs. T. 
She was diagnosed with diabetes 15 years ago. 
Now she lives alone, and for a long time she wasn't doing a good job controlling her disease. 
I was stupid, she says. 
I 've let myself go so much. 
And I don't have anybody else. 
Tears drip from Mrs. T's eyes as she describes all the people she's lost in recent years. 
My mother died, my ex-husband died, my sister died, my brother died and my dog died. 
And I buried everybody !! 
I'm tired of burying people. 
A doctor seeing Mrs. T at a clinic can't know how Mrs. T's emotional distress makes it hard to do what she knows she should do to control her diabetes. 
But a community health worker like Norma Melendez can see all this and can help. 
Even a kind word can do the trick. 
I see her sometimes in the street and I'm like yay !!! 
says Mrs. T. So it's somebody who's here. 
It's not somebody that I go to an office to see that lives in mid-Manhattan. 
And there's an economic reality at work here. 
If City Health Works coaches can keep people like Mrs. T healthy and out of the clinic, that would dramatically reduce the cost of her care. 
Prabhjot Singh says there's another benefit to using health coaches. 
He says they can help build ties between doctors and the local community -- something that could be really important in dealing with a medical crisis like Ebola. 
Coaches like Melendez who don't have any medical training wouldn't have any direct role in caring for sick patients, but they have an important role in building trust between the community and the health care system if a situation does arise, says Singh. 
They have an extremely important role in identifying people that might not feel comfortable going to the health care system. 
City Health Works doesn't intend to rely on foundation grants to keep operating. 
They're gathering data in order to prove to health insurers they have a cost-effective method of solving some of the problems that plague healthcare for the poor in this country. 
And if it works, it would be ironic that a country with the most sophisticated medical care in the world could learn a thing or two from countries that get by on a shoestring.

In 1948, the Supreme Court ended the stranglehold Hollywood studios and distributors had on the U.S. movie market. 
Declaring the big eight a monopoly and ordering them to divest of their ownership of movie theaters and cease other non-competitive practices, with U.S. v. Paramount Pictures, et al., the Court opened the movie industry to independent producers and theaters, and indelibly changed the way we see films and the films we see. 
Prior to the government's efforts to break their trust, a handful of Hollywood studios and distributors controlled nearly all of the movie theaters in the United States, either through direct or indirect ownership, or by the system of block booking. 
With this latter, the big boys insisted that independent theaters contract to run a block of films some set number. 
Between controlling the distribution and exhibition, and its strong-arm negotiating, these few companies decided not only where and when any movie would be shown, but set admission prices, as well. 
Clearly anti-competitive, beginning in 1928 Uncle Sam sought to limit the studios' power. 
Identified by the Federal Trade Commission FTC as having a monopoly over 98% of domestic movie distribution, the Justice Department brought suit in 1929 against Paramount-Famous-Lasky Corporation, First National Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal, United Artists, Fox, Pathé Exchange, FBO Pictures, Vitagraph and Educational Film Exchanges together the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America or MPPDA. 
Declared a trust in the lower courts, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision on November 25, 1930. 
But, since the country was in the mire of the Great Depression, that decision was never enforced, and, rather, in 1933, under the protection of the National Industrial Recovery Act, the studios and the government agreed that the former could continue with business as usual. 
That is, they continued to own and control movie distribution and block booking continued, as well. 
Nonetheless, as the economy improved, the government decided to limit the big studios' grip on distribution, and in July 1938, filed another suit, this time against seven studios Paramount, Loew's, RKO, Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox, Columbia and Universal and one major distributor United Artists. 
The trial was halted only two weeks after it began, and on November 20, 1940, the parties reached a compromise that allowed the studios to keep ownership of theaters, but inhibited block booking. 
This angered independent movie producers, including Charlie Chaplin, Samuel Goldwyn, Mary Pickford, Orson Welles, David O. Selznick and Walt Disney, and together, they formed the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers SIMPP to fight the consent decree. 
Effective, eventually the antitrust suit returned to federal court, and on December 31, 1946, the district court of New York found the defendants in violation of anti-trust laws. 
It then ordered that bidding had to be competitive and movies were to be licensed individually, as well as prohibited admission price fixing, block-licensing of copywritten movies, and joint ownership of theaters by distributors and exhibitors, among other things. 
The parties returned to the Supreme Court, and on May 3, 1948, it entered its decision. 
The high court agreed with the district court on most points, including affirming the prohibition against price-fixing, joint ownership, major franchises and block licensing ; however, the court reversed and remanded on the issue of competitive bidding, noting: 
This Supreme Court decision still controls movie distribution and exhibition in the U.S., and today, studios split gross profits with theaters. 
But how they do it is pretty interesting. 
During the first few weeks of a movie's run, the studio receives the bulk of gross ticket sales. 
While the details vary based on deals between the theaters and the distributors, it's quite common for the theater to fork over 90% -95% of the revenue from the film on week one, perhaps 80% on week two, etc.. 
By the end of the movie's run, when the fewest people are going to see a film, the theater is taking in the lion's share of the gross. 
When averaging the whole run, the theater might only get 20% -30% of the gross ticket sales, with these numbers varying a bit based on a variety of factors. 
Over time, this has developed such that it's not uncommon today for theaters to take a loss for a given movie based on ticket sales alone, particularly movies from major studios. 
There's really little the theaters can do about this, however, as they have extremely limited leverage in negotiations particularly for small theater chains. 
They can't make the movies themselves, and certainly can't turn away major blockbusters, lest people stop going to their theater s. 
In addition, if a given small theater chain is dealing with a major movie studio, the studio may also say something like, Well, if you don't put this movie on 1/4 of your screens for this amount of time and give us X% of the gross, you 'll not be seeing any more Warner Bros. films offered to your theaters. 
Major theater chains have a little more leverage in these negotiations, particularly when dealing with smaller studios, but still not that much in general. 
What this all means is that the theater must find other ways to make money outside of ticket sales. 
The solution is to charge ridiculous prices for concessions, which nonetheless is necessary for them to stay in business at all, at least given the way things are done today. 
The concession hike began in earnest around the 1970s. 
For reference, even with the exorbitantly high prices on food items, only about 4% of a theater's gross revenue in a given year is profit, despite typically around an 85% profit margin on concession sales themselves, according to Australian market research company IBISWorld. 
On the other side, big movies cost pretty amazing sums to produce, and when they flop, that means huge losses for movie studios, despite the favorable terms they get with theaters. 
Since many feel this is a direct consequence of the prohibition of studio ownership of theaters, they are calling for a change in the law. 
One of the many arguments they make is claiming ending the prohibition would have the benefit of allowing studios to target releases geographically to better place movies in more favorable markets, and broaden the types of movies they make. 
As an example, they point to Magic Mike which hugely overperformed in St. Louis, Nashville and Kansas City, but had disappointing sales in New York and L.A.. 
If the studios owned the theaters, they would have shortened Magic Mike's runs on the coast, and perhaps shown it more in the Midwest ; thereby, suffering fewer losses, earning greater profit, and giving people more of what they actually want. 
Another potential benefit of studio ownership of movie theaters is that it would shorten the time it takes a stale film to move from theaters to home release. 
As one industry insider noted: If 92 percent of the gross of a movie comes in the first four weeks, wouldn't it make sense for -LSB- a studio -RSB- to put out a movie and say, after four weeks, ` We're moving this to DVD?' 
Beyond that, studios would have some small incentive to lower the price of concessions in order to increase the number of people coming to the theaters, and thus increase ticket sales and hype for their movies. 
If Disney owned theaters saw higher volumes of ticket sales for their movies, and ticket prices were reasonably close between studios, Disney movies would consistently be topping the box office charts. 
Under the current system, theaters really have little incentive to focus on overall volume of customers, instead trying to focus on the right customers - ones that not only buy tickets, but also are willing to pay the high prices for concessions.

Apple is launching a set of 25 apps created by names -- like Angry Birds, FarmVille and djay -- to raise funds for RED and World AIDS day on December 1st. 
You can buy them now. 
The service is essentially a chat widget that can be embedded into online websites and accessed through mobile apps. 
If you run a site, you are probably wondering how Scrollback is different from software by other companies like MyLiveChat or Chatwee, or commenting platforms such as Livefyre and Disqus. 
On the other hand, if you spend a lot of time in forums, Facebook groups, or on apps like Yik Yak and even the newly launched Facebook Rooms, you might not be sure how to fit yet another chat platform into your life. 
Co-founder Aravind Ravi-Sulekha believes, however, that there is still room for Scrollback to succeed by providing a simple, real-time chat widget that even casual browsers of a forum can participate in. 
For example, you don't have to be a member of a community or website to use its Scrollback widget. 
Since each site's Scrollback is integrated with a mobile app, users can follow a chat whether they are on their PC or smartphone. 
Discussions are public, but Scrollback is currently working on a private chat function. 
In addition to being embedded on sites like Mozilla India and HasGeek, Scrollback has also been used as a networking app at conferences such as the recent JSConf.Asia. 
Ravi-Sulekha says that Scrollback has seen the most traction in Southeast Asia and India, as well as Spanish-speaking communities around the world, but it hopes to target any online community that would otherwise use a forum. 
Scrollback plans to monetize using a freemium model, charging for features such as private community discussions and advanced moderation tools. 
The startup will use its seed funding to build mobile apps, work on its technology, and on marketing. 
Tech companies lobbies all the time -- for tax reform, patent reform. 
But usually, it's in the form of big checks and quiet back room meetings. 
Immigration was different -- the issue where business leaders decided to ally with Latino community groups and labor unions. 
And now that President Obama has issued an executive action, the tech sector is sorting out its next steps. 
In his 2012 State of the Union Address, President Obama said America needs foreign technology workers to stay here and build multi-billion-dollar businesses. 
He cited an iconic leader: -LSB- We -RSB- should support everyone who's willing to work, and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs. 
Meanwhile, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg started giving his own campaign speeches, not just for visas to hire more foreign software engineers, but also for tomato pickers and dishwashers. 
He bridged the deep divide between blue - and white-collar lobbies. 
Zuckerberg did not applaud the move to grant temporary visas to 4 or 5 million immigrants. 
In his own Facebook page, he announced the speech, but then stayed silent about its contents. 
The interim chief of Fwd.us, Todd Schulte, says the action was a step in the right direction but we all agree we have to keep our eye on the ball. 
Legislation is the ultimate prize. 
The company Facebook issued a cautious statement: We look forward to hearing more specifics about the President's plan and how it will impact the skills gap that threatens the competitiveness of the tech sector. 
Similarly, Yahoo says it's reviewing the details. 
Meanwhile companies that are typically outspoken on immigration policy, including Google and Microsoft, did not comment. 
Of course we're still disappointed that he can't raise the caps, and we need a legislative fix, she says, I hope this doesn't make it impossible to get this done. 
It was already very difficult to begin with. 
In a memo issued alongside the executive action, Homeland Security outlines measures to make it easier for H1B workers to go home and switch jobs, so that they're not tied to a low-level position or bad company while waiting for a greencard. 
Their spouses will be able to work too. 
And foreign students will get more time to stay in the country and look for jobs after they graduate. 
The executive action also creates a new kind of visa pathway for foreign entrepreneurs. 
Homeland Security agents will begin to look at start-up founders who are raising investment capital and creating jobs, to consider, on a case-by-case basis, if they can stay. 
Pakistani Faizan Buzdar campaigned for the so-called Start-up Visa. 
He says he raised $ 1.5 million for his San Francisco-based tech company Convo, and that without permanent status, it's hard to raise big money. 
If your immigration status is somewhat unclear, that's a significant risk, he says. 
And it's a significant risk for investors. 
Buzdar says the president's action is a good step, but he doubts it 'll lead to many new visas actually being granted. 
Today I don't have reason to sort of jump in joy and say ` yes, the problem has been completely solved.' 
The lobbying group Venture Politics is searching for a strategy. 
Founder Craig Montuori says, A lot have just lost faith in the political system entirely. 
To be fair, we're also a small community. 
So not a lot of people really have political reason to listen to us, even though our VIPs, our leaders are major donors, Montuori says. 
The up-close footage from the ill fated launch attempt of the Orbital Sciences Corporation Antares rocket has just released, almost a month later. 
It's terrifying. 
In normal cases photographers are allowed to collect the memory cards from their remotely controlled cameras within a few hours after lift off. 
But the October 28th launch was anything but normal.As America Space explains: 
Immediately after the accident the launch complex was sealed off, which is a call made by Range Safety and Orbital Sciences' procedure, at which point an Incident Response Team IRT went out to secure all data -- including impounding of any imagery that could be relevant in the accident investigation. 
This procedure is standard operation in the aftermath of an accident, and for that reason it was not until earlier this week that the press photography team covering the launch finally received some but not all of the launch pad footage that was impounded for the investigation. 
To be honest, it's almost a miracle that cameras around the launch site survived the huge explosion. 
Elliot Severn, a launch photojournalist's first-hand account: 
The vehicle seemed to hang in the air and started to burn, it was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. 
It fell in a pillar of fire and exploded on impact, and we could feel the heat on our face from 1.5 miles away. 
Seconds later the shockwave hit, and we all ran for the buses to evacuate. 
We had little hope of any cameras surviving. 
But they did survive and here is a hellish video compilation of 4 cameras surrounding the launch pad. 
One of the cameras was right in the middle of the fireball, with chunks of rocket debris showering down around it.

Real estate marketplace VivaReal recently raised a $ 41.3 million Series C with Spark Capital and Lead Edge Capital. 
The raise is one of the largest venture capital investments in Brazil this year, behind retailer NetShoes' $ 170 million round and travel giant HotelUrbano's $ 50 million Series D earlier this year, and brings VivaReal's total venture financing to over $ 70 million. 
VivaReal is the largest real estate marketplace in Brazil, with over 2.5 million active listings in over 1,000 cities, and over 3 million unique visitors per month, 98% of whom are in Brazil. 
It recently passed market leader ZAP Imoveis, owned by Globo, the media holding company that runs a virtual monopoly across print, TV and radio platforms in Brazil. 
They're just a beast, says VivaReal co-founder and CEO Brian Requarth. 
We wanted to cash up so we could go head to head. 
We are actually the market leader in traffic, we have more inventory and our geographic coverage is greater. 
We don't know their revenue figures -- they started so much earlier and probably have more. 
But what typically happens in these markets is revenue follows traffic. 
According to Hitwise, VivaReal leads with 19.9% of all real estate traffic in Brazil, compared to ZAP Imoveis' 18.2%, and Imovelweb's 15.4%. 
But VivaReal has about five times the listings as ZAP Imoveis, and 2.5 times as many as Imovelweb. 
Also according to Hitwise, only 5% of VivaReal's traffic is paid, compared to 50% for ZAP Imoveis and 39% for Imovelweb. 
Long before they were rolling in venture capital, co-founders Requarth and Thomas Floracks were living in Bogota, Colombia. 
Requarth was teaching English to make ends meet, and Floracks, a German, was backpacking around Latin America. 
I met Thomas at the Departamento de Seguridad -- we were both paying a fine for overstaying our visas, Requarth recalls. 
We started talking and realized we were both into technology, and started doing anything we could. 
The first website we built was for a tree farm in Sebastopol, Frosty Mountain Tree Farm, where I used to work as Santa Claus when I was a kid. 
Then they started building the real estate broker websites. 
We built up a nice clientele, Requarth says, and then the real estate crisis happened in 2008. 
We took a big hit and we realized it wasn't going to be a big business. 
They started looking at digital marketplaces in Latin America, and decided to place their bets with a residential real estate marketplace in three countries at once: Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. 
On his way to spend New Year's in Rio de Janeiro, Requarth got a random email from a Brazilian friend he'd studied abroad with in Argentina, Diego Simon. 
He told him about his plans, hired him to conduct market research in Brazil, and a few months later, brought him on as VivaReal's third co-founder. 
No contract, Requarth adds. 
Just a handshake. 
Diego flew to Colombia and the three of us penciled out what we thought we needed to be successful as a company, Requarth says. 
From ten things we chose the top three and said this is all we're going to do: grow our listings, grow traffic and sign up customers. 
Their first challenge was getting real estate brokerages to put their listings on VivaReal.com, so they started cold-calling. 
They were like, ` Why should we list on your site? 
You don't even have properties or traffic. 
''' 
So we developed a bot and started scraping listings instead. 
I remember we hired our first intern, we had bought a Skype number in São Paulo and forwarded it to our office in Bogota, and his first day was answering the phone. 
He got bombarded by calls like, ` I'm going to process you, you didn't ask for permission,' total crisis management. 
He told them we were going to start generating contacts for them, and we were able to convert those early angry companies into our first customers. 
By the end of 2009 they had enough traction to start charging brokerages to list. 
Unlike Trulia and Zillow, which offer free listings for real estate brokerages but charge for premium placement, VivaReal charges brokerages and independent agents a flat fee to place all their listings on the site. 
In almost all countries people charge for listings, Requarth explains. 
The US is unique in the sense that it's free to list, mainly because there's an MLS. 
So in the US listings are kind of a commodity, whereas most places in the world, it's highly fragmented. 
And the reason why is that, in most countries, there is no exclusivity of listings. 
Brazil only has sell-side agents, and with no exclusivity, they don't share information, Requarth says. 
It creates a very fragmented marketplace. 
That means we play a really important role for the home buyer, because we have the largest database, he said. 
It's a market scenario that creates a barrier to entry for competition, because the process of obtaining listings is more laborious than in the US. 
There's a second barrier at play as well that would prohibit a Zillow, for example, from easily entering the Brazilian market. 
The US has data standards, so it's easy to pull a data feed of listings, Requarth explains. 
But in Brazil, there are over 50,000 real estate offices using over 100 different providers for their website or CRM. 
So we spent a lot of energy in 2011 adapting to every data format, and it's one of the reasons our growth started to accelerate. 
At the same time, VivaReal pulled out of Colombia and Mexico, moved their headquarters to São Paulo, and decided to go AAB -- All About Brazil. 
Requarth says they wanted to focus, and had underestimated the complexity of executing in multiple markets at once. 
Then there was the question of market size. 
There are more real estate brokerages in the state of Rio de Janeiro than all of Colombia, and about 200,000 agents across Brazil. 
And while Mexico is a big market, the real estate advertising spend last year in Brazil was R$ 4 billion $ 1.5-2 billion dollars according to IBOPE. 
Historically only about 10% of the ad spend goes to the internet, but the market has slowed down a bit. 
That's great for us, because they're accelerating their online spend. 
When business is booming they don't really analyze their ROI, but now it's shifting dramatically online. 
By then the founders had been bootstrapping VivaReal for three years, and decided it was time to raise capital. 
We did it with our own cash -- friends, family and fools. 
I actually sold my apartment in Colombia and put all the money into the business, Requarth recalls. 
Simon Baker, former CEO of publicly traded real estate giant REA Group in Australia, led the first angel round. 
He had been trying to get him on board for a really long time, and finally hired him as a consultant, but we didn't know how we were going to pay for his trip, says Requarth. 
So with five days notice, we organized an event where we invited 100 companies in São Paulo to hear him speak about real estate technology. 
We broke even on the event, covered his consulting fee and airfare, and got a bunch of new clients. 
He was like, ` Holy shit, these guys are scrappy,' and wrote a check for $ 100,000. 
With the participation of friends and family, they closed their first round, about $ 500,000. 
This was not Requarth's first go at scrappy entrepreneurism. 
When I met him in 2003, he and James Gray were undergrads at San Diego State. 
Requarth recalls that they hated the linoleum dorm room floors, and decided to started a business called The Carpet Guys. 
I had the idea to go over to Sid's Carpet Barn and negotiate on consignment a ton of carpet remnants, Requarth says. 
We loaded up on a ridiculous amount of carpet and then we parked in front of the dorm rooms. 
As soon as students started arriving we blitzed them with our Carpet Pitch. 
Parents were sending their kids of for the first time and all they wanted was their kids to have the best ... I don't remember how much we sold, but it was a lot. 
Six months later Viva Real closed their first institutional round, a $ 3.7 million Series A co-led by Kaszek Ventures and Monashees, and Kaszek's Nicolas Szekasy joined the board as an observer. 
Greg Waldorf, Eric Asher from Monashees, and Requarth currently occupy the board. 
Then came a $ 14 million Series B led by hedge fund Valiant, and a $ 8.9 million B2 led by Dragoneer. 
The $ 41.3 million Series C led by Spark Capital and Lead Edge Capital pushes VivaReal's total financing to over $ 70 million dollars. 
VivaReal currently has some 12,000 real estate companies -- about 25% of Brazil's 50,000 or so brokerages -- paying monthly subscriptions powering over 2.5 million listings. 
It is currently their only source of revenue. 
A source close to the company says that revenue is in the tens of millions for 2014 and tripled year over year. 
Traffic has doubled in the last year, and so has mobile traffic, jumping from 14% to 28% of total traffic to VivaReal. 
Requarth says mobile is critical, and that some of the upcoming product launches will be mobile first. 
It's one hell of an impressive trajectory for a Brazilian startup launched by two foreigners, and bootstrapped for its first three years. 
Brazil is not for beginners, in the words of the composer Antonio Carlos Jobim, and the tech market is notoriously difficult for outsiders to break into, in no small part due to Kafka-esque bureaucracy and crushing payroll taxes. 
A lot of people doubted the fact that I was an American, and said we weren't going to be able to do it, Requarth says. 
But having a Brazilian co-founder -- Diego gets a ton of credit. 
The mosaic image of the moon was first captured in the late 1990s, but now it's been remastered using more modern image processing techniques. 
The original version below, first published in 2001, featured color profiles that had been amped right up, making contrast across the surface more obvious. 
The new image above is more subtle but apparently more akin to what the human eye would see if it were somehow in the vicinity. 
Amateurs had previously tried their hands at the task, but this is the first time NASA has released their own efforts. 
The long, curving lines are fractures in the moon's bright ice shell. 
We still don't know exactly what they can tell us about the moon -- but these remastered images could help us understand more than before.

By the time you read this story, Samantha Cristoforetti will have just docked at the International Space Station. 
The Italian astronaut the first female Italian astronaut to make it to the ISS will be 250 miles above Earth's surface, far beyond our ability to see her with our god-given eyes, but not quite far enough that we can't say hello to her. 
To say hello, all you have to do is press the green button. 
Using Friends In Space, a new web app from Italian design studio Accurat, terrestrial humans can directly communicate with Cristoforetti with the click of a mouse -- she just needs to be orbiting your section of Earth. 
You can do more than that though: The website lets you track her past, current, and future orbits ; it visualizes the astronauts' daily log of activities ; it loops in live audio and video from the ISS. 
Oh, and it's technically a social network, allowing you to connect with other digital stargazers by saying hello to them, when Cristoforetti is out of your orbit. 
Friends in Space was born after Accurat co-founder and design director Giorgia Lupi began corresponding with Cristoforetti on Twitter. 
The astronaut had seen some of the studio's work and wondered if there was a way to collaborate on her inaugural launch. 
Cristoforetti is a new breed of social-media savvy astronaut -- she has nearly 84,000 Twitter followers and she updates her Google + page regularly with scenes from training and her soon-to-be life on the ISS. 
She liked the idea of doing something that wasn't scientific, says Lupi. 
Something that reminded people on Earth that there is a human up there talking to them. 
The ISS makes plenty of information available to anyone who is curious, but much of it is complicated and opaque in the way scientific data tends to be. 
The design team wanted to distill that down to its most humanistic form. 
The app pulls in data from Cristoforetti's social feeds and gives context to the daily activities on the ISS by adding media videos, photos, etc from NASA. 
We're essentially rebuilding a visual diary of her experiences, says Gabriele Rossi, co-founder and managing director at Accurat. 
Friends In Space is a fascinating site to toy around on. 
The visualizations and interactions are simple enough to make the data easy to grasp, but it's complex enough that you 'll want to spend some time exploring, seeing how much more you can discover about the mission. 
Every so often a fuzzy conversation between the astronauts and mission control will pipe into your speaker -- it's a nice reminder of the wonderment that comes with space travel. 
In real time you're hearing someone currently stationed far beyond our comprehension communicating with someone back on Earth. 
Now, we have the chance -- no matter how simple a hello is -- to communicate back. 
As Rossi puts it: We're giving people the possibility to say, ` I once said hello to an astronaut and she said hello back.

When his friend Kelly mentioned she was interviewing for a new job, Peter Brown told her there was an article she needed to read. 
He couldn't remember where he'd seen it. 
And he couldn't remember what company it was about. 
But he knew she had to read it. 
And, luckily, he had invented an app that could find it. 
Built for desktop and laptop machines, the app is called Fetching.io. 
It caches every single webpage you visit, creating your own personal search engine where you can search solely what you 've seen in the past. 
Brown came up with the idea after trying -- and failing -- to find something else that did this. 
I got sick and tired of losing websites I'd seen before -- or spending a frustratingly long time re-finding them, he says. 
You know how it is. 
You visit so many different sites and use so many different apps that it's hard to remember where you 've read what. 
You can try Googling for particular phrases you might remember from an article, but that's not always enough to find what you're looking for. 
Services like Evernote and Pinterest let you save things you find for future reference. 
The problem is: you have to make a conscious decision to save something as you see it. 
If you just browse an article, not realizing it will come in handy one day, you're out of luck. 
Most modern browsers let you search your internet history, but their search tools are limited -- to say the least -- and if you reinstall your browser or buy a new computer, your browser history may be gone. 
Fetching.io, on the other hand, captures every site you visit automatically. 
It includes advanced search tools to help you find what you're looking for. 
And, if you want, you can store your browsing history indefinitely. 
The app started life as an online service, storing all of your history on the net so that you could search it from any computer or smartphone. 
But that raised a few privacy questions, so Brown built a desktop version, available for Apple Macs, that only runs locally. 
This may still be a privacy concern -- internet hackers are still a threat, and so are curious family members -- but at least you can make sure your data isn't stored on someone else's machine. 
Brown works on the tool in his spare time, separate from his day job as a developer, and for now, it's free. 
But he hopes to turn it into a business. 
In the future, he may charge a one-time fee for the desktop app and some sort of a recurring fee for the cloud service. 
In order to avoid any sort of outside pressure to mine the data he collects, Brown is trying to retain as much control over the app as possible. 
He's decided to keep things simple and forgo raising venture capital, inspired by solo entrepreneurs like Instapaper founder Marco Arment and Pinboard founder Maciej Ceglowski, who have proven it's possible to run a successful one-man business. 
He also wants to turn the app into something more than just a memory aid, believing it could help people reflect more deeply on their online lives. 
Your iPhoto album goes back twenty years now. 
You can go back and see what you were taking pictures of back then, and relive those memories to a certain extent. 
But you can't go back and see what webpages you were browsing back then, he says. 
We spend so much time searching for stuff on the internet that it's part of our personality. 
Right now, all of that gets lost. 
When you're making a comeback, your odds of success go up when working with material everyone loves. 
And by all accounts, people love the new Ford Mustang. 
The fastback design recalls the early days of the famed pony car, and the 5.0-liter V8 engine, six-speed manual and thoroughly modern suspension deliver on performance. 
So it was a good starting point for Henrik Fisker's return to the car world. 
You remember, Fisker, right? 
Great designer, penned some knockouts like the Aston Martin DB9 and BMW Z8, then thought he'd start his own automaker. 
That didn't go well at all, even if the plug-in hybrid Fisker Karma was a stunner. 
We haven't heard much from the man aside from that motorcycle he designed since he left his eponymously named automaker in early 2013. 
But there he was on Thursday at the LA Auto show with that guy from Glapin Auto Sports, pulling the sheet off the Rocket, a custom-bodied Mustang with 725 horsepower, bold lines and several square yards of carbon fiber. 
Although Fisker's no stranger to designing sweet cars and even did a little coachbuilding, he's more commonly associated with continental fare like Aston and BMW. 
Turns out he's always had a thing for the original pony car. 
I 've always wanted to design a Mustang, Fisker told us. 
I just never really had the opportunity in my career because the timing was never right. 
He arrived at Ford where he worked as design director for Aston Martin in 2000 and never got to work on a Mustang before heading out on his own in 2004 to launch Fisker Coachbuild. 
Then came Fisker Automotive, which, well, failed spectacularly. 
Now he's a free agent, and when Fisker saw the all-new Mustang, he saw what he called, a fantastic starting point to do something special. 
Then he caught up with Beau Boeckmann, an old friend and COO of Galpin, as the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance in August. 
One thing led to another, and they started talking about a coachbuilt Mustang. 
Fisker showed him a few sketches, and Boeckmann loved the idea. 
They set to work. 
They had to move quickly, because they wanted the car ready for the LA Auto Show. 
That gave them three months. 
It didn't help that Ford didn't begin delivering Mustangs until September. 
With a project like this, Fisker typically spends about six months with the car, figuring out what he wanted to do and how to do it. 
He had seven weeks. 
While waiting for his Mustang to arrive, Fisker spent more time than usual working in two dimensions, using drawings, based on photographs of the 2015 Mustang, to hone his design before working in 3-D. 
When the Mustang finally arrived, Fisker and his team made two digital scans, one of the car with its bodywork and another without. 
This provided them with the care's exact dimensions and identified key structural pieces Fisker didn't want to touch. 
Once you start playing with structural components, he says, you make the project far more complex and risk compromising crashworthiness. 
A key goal was maintaining the fundamental design, so any Ford mechanic can handle repairs. 
It may be one of the most affordable supercars to actually maintain and drive, Fisker says. 
From there, Fisker's team milled a full-size clay model of the car, with which Fisker made the very finest changes and adjustments, often measured in millimeters, to nail the design. 
He likes working with clay because it provides a more realistic representation of what the car will look like. 
That's where you get that last 10 percent of emotion, he said. 
Once the model was perfect, the team scanned it and set to work making molds for the carbon fiber bodywork. 
The Rocket is a Mustang that's been thoroughly upgraded yet retains its roots. 
I didn't want people to go, ` What is that? 
''' Fisker said. 
It should be recognizable. 
There are styling cues from Fisker's favorite Mustangs, the hot-rodded Shelby models of the late 1960s. 
And the grille is clearly inspired by the 1967 Mustang. 
Only the original's steel doors and roof remain ; everything else is carbon fiber and designed by Fisker. 
He added more curve to the front fender and the front wheel lips, and air intakes on the front wheel wells. 
The car's belt line kicks out near the rear of the car, and it's got an integrated rear spoiler. 
And of course it's got racing stripes, because Mustang. 
But rather than paint them on, he simply left the carbon fiber exposed. 
The Rocket doesn't just look faster. 
It is faster. 
Galpin gave the 5.0-liter V8 a supercharger to give the car whopping 67 percent increase in power, from 435 horsepower to 725. 
That tops even Dodge's tire-smoking Challenger Hellcat. 
Fisker and Galpin haven't revealed performance specs because they haven't done the testing yet. 
But Boeckmann and Fisker promise the Rocket will be quite capable of running with far more expensive European cars, even if they weren't willing to name any specific marques they 've got in their sights cough * Ferrari * cough * Lamborghini * cough. 
We think the new Mustang is so good that by doing what we 've done to it, it can actually play in that league, Fisker said. 
How much? 
How many? 
That's to be determined, but Galpin and Fisker expect to sell a few hundred Rocket for a bit over $ 100,000 a pop. 
If it lives up to the numbers they promise, that's a pretty good deal: It's a great-looking muscle car that promises to put down crazy numbers and burn all the rubber you can stick on the back wheels.

Drew Bennett was enjoying Dolores Park one weekend, hanging out with some friends, when his phone rang. 
Mark Zuckerberg, the caller told him, would be at his studio that afternoon. 
So Bennett left his friends, hopped on his bike, and pedaled across San Francisco to the Dogpatch, down near the bay. 
He didn't expect the visit from Zuckeberg, but he had a little time to prepare, hanging some of his artwork around the studio walls. 
When Zuckerberg arrived, the Facebook founder and CEO sat down in a chair at the center of the studio and took it all in. 
So, he said, what am I looking at? 
Zuckerberg must have liked Bennett's answer -- not to mention his art, a collection meant to show people coming together. 
Facebook soon hired Bennett to decorate the walls of its offices in downtown Palo Alto, just south of San Francisco. 
The year was 2007, and he spent four months painting a series of murals inside Facebook, working every night, all night. 
He wasn't the first artist to use Facebook as a canvas -- or the last. 
In exchange for some Facebook stock -- which ultimately made him very rich -- graffiti artist David Choe tricked out the walls at Facebook's original office, on Palo Alto's Emerson Street, and so many other artists followed -- with their paints, brushes, and spray cans -- as the company expanded into newer campuses. 
But Bennett would do more than just paint those murals. 
A childhood friend of Facebook chief of staff Chris Cox, he returned to the company five years later, and eventually, he bootstrapped a formal artist-in-residence program at Facebook's current offices, a massive campus in Menlo Park, California. 
At any given time, at least one artist is set up inside the company -- and perhaps as many as three -- creating art on the walls and the doorways and the stairwells and the ceilings. 
The dialog between many different visual languages, Bennett says, is inherently more interesting than any one visual language alone. 
As much as PHP code and The Hacker Way, art is a fundamental part of the Facebook culture. 
Art doesn't just decorate Facebook's offices, it defines them, and in this way, Bennett says, it helps shape the company's attitude. 
Facebook, its top engineers like to say, is a company of builders. 
They build things inside machines -- desktops and laptops and smartphones -- and all around them, artists build things in the physical world. 
One feeds the other -- at least in small ways. 
It's a visual and a physical manifestation of what's happening on the computers, Bennett says. 
You could just present your values on a piece of paper. 
But inviting a diverse group of independent artists to work alongside us is a more genuine expression of that creative process. 
Corporate art is an old thing. 
But this is something different. 
All Facebook art is commissioned We only support new work being made, Bennett says. 
It's much rawer than what you'd find at, say, JP Morgan. 
And it's not necessarily an investment. 
Most of it is physically part of the office and therefore difficult to move, let alone sell -- though the company has moved some of Choe's art from office to office. 
Facebook art is more about vibe than anything else. 
At the original Facebook office, Choe's murals were, in Bennett's words, kind of aggressive. 
One piece showed a rather bare woman riding some sort of fanged beast -- the sort of thing recently lampooned in HBO's spot-on parody of the Northern California startup community: Silicon Valley. 
And according to Jet Martinez, who painted a mural on the current campus in 2012, at least part of this anything-goes attitude persisted as the company evolved. 
Martinez came to the company through an art consultant named Danielle Wohl -- Like everything at Facebook, he says, she had a personal connection to someone who worked there -- and in 2012, he was paid about $ 4,000 to paint Bouquet, an enormous burst of flowers, in Building 17. 
Facebook's art scene, he says, was like the wild west. 
He remembers coming in one morning to find that Choe and others had destroyed the building, running through the halls, dragging lines of paint across wall after wall after wall. 
Nobody was in charge, he says, and nobody wanted to be in charge. 
Since then, Bennett has organized the company's art efforts into something more formal and regular -- a reflection of Facebook's larger maturation. 
Each artist receives a standard honorarium -- not stock -- in exchange for the rights to their work, so they're not in Menlo Park to get rich. 
They work for between four and 16 weeks. 
And they're treated much like any other employee. 
They're required to spend at least some time working alongside Bennett and others in what's called the Analog Research Lab, helping create the many silkscreen prints and posters that also line the company's walls. 
They're hired on as peers, Bennett says. 
But Bennett makes a point of saying artists are free to paint and build what they want. 
Kelly Ording, who's married to Jet Martinez, later joined this artist-in-residence program, painting a series of murals in Menlo Park. 
She was paid $ 10,000 for the work, which seems to be the going rate, but she says it wasn't the money that attracted her. 
There's the publicity that comes with the Facebook name, but there's also the work itself. 
She calls her project experimental -- something designed to transform an entire space, on all sides -- and she could take it where she wanted to take it. 
They really encourage you, she says, to take risks. 
As that Silicon Valley parody shows, this kind of thing has become a touchstone for the rest of the startup world. 
You go to other corporate spaces and they're almost buying the Facebook package, says Martinez. 
This comes with snack bars, Razor scooters -- and murals. 
But Facebook still takes things further than most. 
Alan Bamberger, who chronicles the art business, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, for the site ArtBusiness.com, says Bennett has fostered something unusual in Menlo Park. 
I haven't seen anyone think this through, to this extent, he says. 
It's really using Facebook as kind of a laboratory for art. 
And now, Bennett and company have brought the same idea to the company's new offices in both New York and Dublin. 
On some level, the art fits the locale -- In New York, Bennett says, it's a little more urban -- but the basic vibe is the same. 
It's a vibe that envelops you see images above, from Menlo Park and New York. 
You're surrounded at nearly every turn, both inside the building and outside, in the halls and the common rooms and the kitchens. 
This includes countless murals, but also installations -- most notably a DNA-like spiral of recycled wood from Barbara Holmes that snakes through a stairwell at the heart of the Menlo Park campus -- and so much of the other wall space is filled with those prints and posters, which feed the Facebook attitude in other ways, trumpeting maxims like Fortune Favors the Bold, Move Fast and Build Things, Nothing At Facebook Is Somebody Else's Problem, and What Would You Do If You Weren't Afraid? 
We, as a company, have a unique opportunity to own our space, Bennett says. 
That same spirit that Mark honored David Choe with, we still honor today.

Go home.No director captured the angst and everyday indignities of an average teenager's world like John Hughes. 
Granted, as a child of the ’80s, I'm probably a little biased. 
But consider the man's work for a moment: Between 1984 and 1987, Hughes cranked out six teen films -- the majority of which are still considered benchmarks of the genre.As plenty of critics have noted, much of the late filmmaker's success is probably tied to the way he portrayed teens. 
Rather than mindless, horny sex fiends, the characters in a John Hughes film are sensitive, vulnerable horny sex fiends. 
You know, believable teens. 
But the man behind The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, and Weird Science didn't just have empathy for his subjects and a good ear for dialogue. 
He was also a scholar of adolescent archetypes, and knew how to embellish to great effect. 
And nowhere is this better demonstrated than in 1986's Ferris Bueller's Day Off.Part buddy movie, part coming-of age story, this classic school-skipping tale is markedly different than the rest of Hughes's teenage oeuvre. 
That's because Ferris is the opposite of a typical teenager. 
He's preternaturally cool, self-assured, comfortable around girls, and wise beyond his years. 
As Grace reminds Mr. Rooney, The sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wastoids, dweebies, dickheads -- they all adore him. 
They think he's a righteous dude. 
Fittingly, this righteous dude's bedroom is equally excellent. 
In fact, of all the teenage rooms in cinema history, Ferris's might be the most impressive.

Every frame is stuffed with, well, awesome stuff. 
Audiophile-worthy stack and speakers? 
Check. 
Legendary guitar and amp? 
Of course. 
Television and camera with a closed-circuit video feed? 
Uh, sure. 
And it's all rounded out with posters and knick-knacks that speak to Bueller's impeccable musical tastes, creativity, and technical know how.The lust-worthy gear isn't just limited to Bueller's bedroom: Cameron's modernist bedroom isn't lacking in the toy department either. 
And that ’61 Ferrari GT 250 -- which in most scenes was actually just a modified MG sports car -- isn't half bad either. 
There are so many desirable objects in the movie that it's only fitting it helped popularize what is still the default song for gadget lust and other states of covetous consumerism: Yello's Oh Yeah. 
Rewatching Ferris Bueller's Day Off today, I 'll admit that some of the film's magic has worn off. 
To a 36-year-old, Ferris seems considerably more manipulative, selfish, and douchey then he did to the 14-year-old me. 
On the other hand, as someone whose job it is to look at and evaluate gadgets all day, I do have a new appreciation and nostalgic yearning for all the amazing stuff peppered throughout Hughes's film.It almost begs to be cataloged -- and so we did just that. 
It's not a comprehensive list I couldn't find, for instance, the model of the fancy speakerphone in Cameron's room, but it's close. 
As Ferris might say: The movie moves pretty fast. 
If you don't stop and look around at all the sweet-ass gadgets, you could miss them.

Peter Dahmen is a paper engineer. 
Which in practice is totally different than, say, a mechanical engineer or a civil engineer, but in principle maybe not so much. 
Engineers solve problems, and Dahmen does technically solve problems. 
Even if they are just made of paper. 
For the past 25 years the German graphic designer has been creating impossible-looking pop-up sculptures out of the material. 
Dahmen is deft with a pair of scissors and a tube of glue. 
He's quick -- but accurate -- with a cut and a fold. 
These skills have led to some pretty neat creations. 
Dahmen has always been interested in paper. 
Even as a child he recalls rather spending time in his room, cutting and painting rather than playing football outside. 
But it wasn't until the late 1980s when his graphic design teacher gave him the task of creating a three-dimensional graphic from a piece of paper that the idea of pop-ups struck him. 
Without a car, there was no easy way to transport his homework. 
Unless he folded it. 
Dahmen realized he had a knack for folding and cutting and began exploring new ways to create pop-up sculptures. 
His best pieces are abstract -- they draw your eye to the motion of opening and closing rather than the sculpture itself. 
This is key, says Dahmen. 
It's not hard to make something 3-D ; the real trick is to make sure it lays flat. 
To ensure that happens, he begins crafting each piece by hand. 
I'm often asked which software I use, but that's a mistake, he says. 
When I started to create pop up cards I didn't even have a computer. 
He 'll create dozens of rough examples, measuring bits of paper, tweaking their angles, gluing them in different ways to ensure they collapse easily. 
It's a lot of trial and error, he says. 
Most of Dahmen's creations are sharp-edged and architectural. 
True curves are nearly impossible to achieve he says, a fact due to the inherent nature of folding paper. 
You can create the illusion of rounded edges, but ultimately, it's just a bunch of strategically-placed lines. 
The things that resemble architecture are always easier to solve than the things that look like nature, like real flowers, he says. 
For years, Dahmen kept his work to himself. 
I didn't show it to anybody, he says. 
I figured the world would be bored by looking at my white, abstract pop-up cards. 
He was definitely wrong. 
A few years back Dahmen uploaded his first video showing six of his pieces. 
Today the video has more than 3 million views. 
On Friday, the FDA announced that it would start developing a stockpile of blood plasma from Ebola survivors, treated with a pathogen inactivation system that's never been used before in the United States. 
So far, the US has had some amazing success in curing Ebola, possibly thanks to experimental plasma treatments. 
Drawn from survivors, the stuff comes enriched in antibodies that could help to fight off the disease -- but it also has the potential to carry other diseases, like malaria, that are common in west Africa where Ebola is raging. 
The new system will kill off any extra contaminants that may be lurking in this potentially live-saving serum. 
It's the same one, Cerus Corporation's Intercept system, that will be used in a Gates Foundation-funded study of Ebola treatments in West Africa. 
The pathogen-killing molecule at the heart of the system is amotosalen, part of a class of three-ringed molecules called psoralens. 
They're the compounds in lime that cause what some doctors call Mexican beer dermatitis: Get a squirt of the citrus on your skin when you push it into your Corona, spend a few hours on the beach in the sunlight, and the molecules interact with the UV rays to give you a nasty rash. 
Amotosalen works in the same way. 
When technicians add it to blood plasma, it nestles in the middle of DNA and RNA helices, linking the bases on either side. 
Then, activated by a burst of UV light, it irreversibly bonds to those bases -- so the genetic material can't replicate any more. 
Pathogens, inactivated. 
Europe has long used blood purification systems -- Intercept was first approved eight years ago, and there are other techniques, too. 
But the FDA has been slow to approve the same technology in the US, mostly, it seems, for lack of demand. 
We already screen donated blood for several common contaminants: infectious diseases like hepatitis, West Nile, and Chagas disease. 
The Red Cross also screens for HIV, but unfortunately the FDA still prohibits gay men from donating blood. 
Those screens mean it's very safe to use donated blood in the United States. 
But that can change when new diseases enter the pipeline -- ones that we don't test for, or ones that we don't even know exist. 
For the FDA, the tipping point might have been two diseases that are new to the US, Chikungunya and dengue. 
As temperatures rise, mosquitoes migrate northwards, carrying diseases that have historically been stuck in warmer, tropical countries. 
So in October, the FDA approved the Intercept system for use in areas like Florida and Texas where the mosquito-borne diseases are becoming a problem. 
Nobody's used the treated plasma yet. 
Because they're so uncommon here, we don't test for those two diseases, or malaria. 
But soon, testing may not be enough. 
There's an increasing realization that it's challenging to be proactive about epidemics with our current testing paradigm, said William ` Obi' Greenman, Cerus' president and chief executive officer. 
We may be confronting enough new pathogens in this rapidly changing climate of ours that inactivation will become necessary to keep our blood supply safe. 
If so, the FDA is ready ; Greenman says they're likely to approve the Intercept system to treat all donated blood in the next several months. 
By the time you read this story, Samantha Cristoforetti will have just docked at the International Space Station. 
The Italian astronaut the first female Italian astronaut to make it to the ISS will be 250 miles above Earth's surface, far beyond our ability to see her with our god-given eyes, but not quite far enough that we can't say hello to her. 
To say hello, all you have to do is press the green button. 
Using Friends In Space, a new web app from Italian design studio Accurat, terrestrial humans can directly communicate with Cristoforetti with the click of a mouse -- she just needs to be orbiting your section of Earth. 
You can do more than that though: The website lets you track her past, current, and future orbits ; it visualizes the astronauts' daily log of activities ; it loops in live audio and video from the ISS. 
Oh, and it's technically a social network, allowing you to connect with other digital stargazers by saying hello to them, when Cristoforetti is out of your orbit. 
Friends in Space was born after Accurat co-founder and design director Giorgia Lupi began corresponding with Cristoforetti on Twitter. 
The astronaut had seen some of the studio's work and wondered if there was a way to collaborate on her inaugural launch. 
Cristoforetti is a new breed of social-media savvy astronaut -- she has nearly 84,000 Twitter followers and she updates her Google + page regularly with scenes from training and her soon-to-be life on the ISS. 
She liked the idea of doing something that wasn't scientific, says Lupi. 
Something that reminded people on Earth that there is a human up there talking to them. 
The ISS makes plenty of information available to anyone who is curious, but much of it is complicated and opaque in the way scientific data tends to be. 
The design team wanted to distill that down to its most humanistic form. 
The app pulls in data from Cristoforetti's social feeds and gives context to the daily activities on the ISS by adding media videos, photos, etc from NASA. 
We're essentially rebuilding a visual diary of her experiences, says Gabriele Rossi, co-founder and managing director at Accurat. 
Friends In Space is a fascinating site to toy around on. 
The visualizations and interactions are simple enough to make the data easy to grasp, but it's complex enough that you 'll want to spend some time exploring, seeing how much more you can discover about the mission. 
Every so often a fuzzy conversation between the astronauts and mission control will pipe into your speaker -- it's a nice reminder of the wonderment that comes with space travel. 
In real time you're hearing someone currently stationed far beyond our comprehension communicating with someone back on Earth. 
Now, we have the chance -- no matter how simple a hello is -- to communicate back. 
As Rossi puts it: We're giving people the possibility to say, ` I once said hello to an astronaut and she said hello back.

When his friend Kelly mentioned she was interviewing for a new job, Peter Brown told her there was an article she needed to read. 
He couldn't remember where he'd seen it. 
And he couldn't remember what company it was about. 
But he knew she had to read it. 
And, luckily, he had invented an app that could find it. 
Built for desktop and laptop machines, the app is called Fetching.io. 
It caches every single webpage you visit, creating your own personal search engine where you can search solely what you 've seen in the past. 
Brown came up with the idea after trying -- and failing -- to find something else that did this. 
I got sick and tired of losing websites I'd seen before -- or spending a frustratingly long time re-finding them, he says. 
You know how it is. 
You visit so many different sites and use so many different apps that it's hard to remember where you 've read what. 
You can try Googling for particular phrases you might remember from an article, but that's not always enough to find what you're looking for. 
Services like Evernote and Pinterest let you save things you find for future reference. 
The problem is: you have to make a conscious decision to save something as you see it. 
If you just browse an article, not realizing it will come in handy one day, you're out of luck. 
Most modern browsers let you search your internet history, but their search tools are limited -- to say the least -- and if you reinstall your browser or buy a new computer, your browser history may be gone. 
Fetching.io, on the other hand, captures every site you visit automatically. 
It includes advanced search tools to help you find what you're looking for. 
And, if you want, you can store your browsing history indefinitely. 
The app started life as an online service, storing all of your history on the net so that you could search it from any computer or smartphone. 
But that raised a few privacy questions, so Brown built a desktop version, available for Apple Macs, that only runs locally. 
This may still be a privacy concern -- internet hackers are still a threat, and so are curious family members -- but at least you can make sure your data isn't stored on someone else's machine. 
Brown works on the tool in his spare time, separate from his day job as a developer, and for now, it's free. 
But he hopes to turn it into a business. 
In the future, he may charge a one-time fee for the desktop app and some sort of a recurring fee for the cloud service. 
In order to avoid any sort of outside pressure to mine the data he collects, Brown is trying to retain as much control over the app as possible. 
He's decided to keep things simple and forgo raising venture capital, inspired by solo entrepreneurs like Instapaper founder Marco Arment and Pinboard founder Maciej Ceglowski, who have proven it's possible to run a successful one-man business. 
He also wants to turn the app into something more than just a memory aid, believing it could help people reflect more deeply on their online lives.

Right now, all of that gets lost. 
When you're making a comeback, your odds of success go up when working with material everyone loves. 
And by all accounts, people love the new Ford Mustang. 
The fastback design recalls the early days of the famed pony car, and the 5.0-liter V8 engine, six-speed manual and thoroughly modern suspension deliver on performance. 
So it was a good starting point for Henrik Fisker's return to the car world. 
You remember, Fisker, right? 
Great designer, penned some knockouts like the Aston Martin DB9 and BMW Z8, then thought he'd start his own automaker. 
That didn't go well at all, even if the plug-in hybrid Fisker Karma was a stunner. 
We haven't heard much from the man aside from that motorcycle he designed since he left his eponymously named automaker in early 2013. 
But there he was on Thursday at the LA Auto show with that guy from Glapin Auto Sports, pulling the sheet off the Rocket, a custom-bodied Mustang with 725 horsepower, bold lines and several square yards of carbon fiber. 
Although Fisker's no stranger to designing sweet cars and even did a little coachbuilding, he's more commonly associated with continental fare like Aston and BMW. 
Turns out he's always had a thing for the original pony car. 
I 've always wanted to design a Mustang, Fisker told us. 
I just never really had the opportunity in my career because the timing was never right. 
He arrived at Ford where he worked as design director for Aston Martin in 2000 and never got to work on a Mustang before heading out on his own in 2004 to launch Fisker Coachbuild. 
Then came Fisker Automotive, which, well, failed spectacularly. 
Now he's a free agent, and when Fisker saw the all-new Mustang, he saw what he called, a fantastic starting point to do something special. 
Then he caught up with Beau Boeckmann, an old friend and COO of Galpin, as the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance in August. 
One thing led to another, and they started talking about a coachbuilt Mustang. 
Fisker showed him a few sketches, and Boeckmann loved the idea. 
They set to work. 
They had to move quickly, because they wanted the car ready for the LA Auto Show. 
That gave them three months. 
It didn't help that Ford didn't begin delivering Mustangs until September. 
With a project like this, Fisker typically spends about six months with the car, figuring out what he wanted to do and how to do it. 
He had seven weeks. 
While waiting for his Mustang to arrive, Fisker spent more time than usual working in two dimensions, using drawings, based on photographs of the 2015 Mustang, to hone his design before working in 3-D. 
When the Mustang finally arrived, Fisker and his team made two digital scans, one of the car with its bodywork and another without. 
This provided them with the care's exact dimensions and identified key structural pieces Fisker didn't want to touch. 
Once you start playing with structural components, he says, you make the project far more complex and risk compromising crashworthiness. 
A key goal was maintaining the fundamental design, so any Ford mechanic can handle repairs. 
It may be one of the most affordable supercars to actually maintain and drive, Fisker says.
